1,spring,2000,s2000,alberta-ferretti,"Not one to lose touch with her clients' need for romantic, feminine clothing with an urban edge, Ferretti delivered the goods this season. Transparency was the key to her array of dreamy, girly dresses with delicate beading and ruffles in light shades of brick, green, yellow and pale blue. There were also shiny slim pants, delicate twinsets, and peasant-inspired tops and long skirts. It was a subtle, contemporary and practical collection that will keep girls looking fresh for the year 2000.</p></div>"
2,spring,2000,s2000,alessandro-dell-acqua,"She's back in style and readily available. The early '80s disco dolly came out to party in full force at Alessandro Dell'Acqua's show. Sex was clearly the driving force behind this cavalcade of one-shouldered purple, red and black tulle shirts, cowl-necked satin tops and paillette-encrusted slacks that took over the runway. Accessories were no less bold and added to the shimmering extravaganza—decorated boots, dangling rhinestone chains worn as belts or necklaces under layers of transparent fabric and bags with dripping beads. It was a strobe-light affair.</p></div>"
3,spring,2000,s2000,alexander-mcqueen,"With cheeky insouciance <strong><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/alexander-mcqueen/"">Alexander McQueen</a></strong> dropped trou at the end of his Spring 2000 show to reveal his stars and stripes boxers. Eye was shown in New York, on a pier on the West side, and, once again, the models sloshed through water. They wore clothes that drew from active sportswear, bondage, and the Middle East; <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/model/Gisele-Bundchen"">Gisele</a>, for one, wore a tasseled and embroidered head covering with a metal-pailleted bodysuit. There was no ignoring the collection’s latent aggression when spikes rose through the water. Over those frightening points soared acrobats in burka-like shrouds, some striped red, others colored black, like good and bad angels.</p></div>"
4,spring,2000,s2000,ann-demeulemeester,"The relationship between word and image was the theme for Ann Demeulemeester's predominantly black and white collection. Bands of text with messages like ""Curious wishes feathered the air,"" and ""Morning found the field bright"" were inscribed on tank tops and jackets. Overlays of transparent tulle, sometimes decorated with subtle beading, covered Demeulemeester's well-known black pantsuits. There were also lighter pieces, like ecru papery jackets, distressed denim pants, and simple knit sweaters.</p></div>"
5,spring,2000,s2000,anna-molinari,"""Lou Lou goes on vacanza with a trunk of white and gold,"" was Rosella Tarabini's inspiration for Anna Molinari. Lou Lou also packed an assortment of prints, Pierrot dresses, floral appliqués, and every paillette she could find. Gold leather ensembles were shown alongside frilly polka-dotted dresses, ""I love you"" printed chiffon numbers, and provenç;al florals on devore velvet. Tarabini felt her collection was ""pure St. Tropez,"" but many of her pieces would certainly not be unwelcome at the colorful and extravagant festivities of Rio de Janeiro.</p></div>"
6,spring,2000,s2000,anna-sui,"""An American prairie girl goes to Goa"" would be a good way to describe Anna Sui's unapologetically rich summer collection. Her looks were at times sexy, often innocent, but always bedecked with embroidery, ruffles, beading and a rampage of colorful patterns. Western-inspired pieces like dark denim capri jeans and jackets were bejeweled and studded '70s-inspired Empire dresses were stitched from rambunctious paisley prints; and floral-print ruched blouses were in abundance. Clearly, restraint was not even a minor consideration for Sui, who went for all-out luxe.</p></div>"
7,spring,2000,s2000,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi's runway positively oozed with raw energy as he presented one of the most unapolegetically sexy collections so far. Necklines plunged, skimpy leather dresses clung to the body for dear life and flowing, floor-length evening gowns in shocking pink, orange and yellow were simultaneously old-world and unflinchingly modern. Berardi once again proved his skill at combining deft tailoring (as in his white, sharp tuxedo suits) with extravagant sensuality (silky cocktail dresses never looked better). As if that weren't enough, this time around he threw in Murano glass, vertigo-inducing ankle-cuff stilettos, Lalique jewelry and edgy headpieces by Stephen Jones.</p></div>"
8,spring,2000,s2000,as-four,"In February of 2000, As Four (Adi Gil, Angela Donhauser, Gabi Asfour, and Kai Kühne), had already defined their aesthetic as organic and curvilinear. They had put this into practice in “Human Plant,” a collection that they created and photographed to publish in <em>Zink Magazine</em>, but they hadn’t gone public with their work—aside from sometimes wearing the pieces they made. When <em>Paper</em>’s Kim Hastreiter offered them a chance to show at the Bryant Park tents as part of a sort of alt-fashion/art event she was curating, the team jumped at the chance. “We wanted to really show how we worked,” Gabi Asfour later told <em>Vogue</em>.</p><p>The result was “Puppen Couture” a magical installation of miniature As Four garments shown en masse on wind-up hula dancing dolls the quartet found on Canal Street. As they twirled in their haphazard way to Wagner, the dolls placed As Four firmly at the center of downtown New York’s fashion/art nexus.</p></div>"
9,spring,2000,s2000,badgley-mischka,"""Our collection is girly and optimistic, younger than usual, and definitely glamorous,"" explained Mark Badgley. The presentation featured nearly all the colors of the rainbow in cool sorbet shades, like light rose, lime green, and citron yellow tempered with white. Reserving their trademark glittering gowns for last, Badgley Mischka devoted the first part of the show to embroidered, shimmery separates that included wearable georgette tops, raspberry sequin skirts, and fuchsia sprinkle-beaded jackets.</p></div>"
10,spring,2000,s2000,balenciaga,"Nicholas Ghesquière continued his revival of the silhouettes Balenciaga pioneered in the '50s, and brought them up to speed (which, in this season, means going back to the '80s). Loose sack-dresses, sweaters and coats with dolman sleeves, as well as pleated pants tapered at the bottom, predominated; but there were also preppy, slim trousers with matching long-sleeved shirts and blazers. The palette was restrained for the most part: Plum, beige, and navy were the main colors.</p></div>"
11,spring,2000,s2000,balmain,"It was quite a dramatic presentation at Balmain, featuring everything from feather paste-on brassieres to rough-cut cavegirl-like skirts and microskirts, and Jackson Pollock-inspired prints. Of course, there were also plenty of more sedate pieces—pretty twinsets in pastel shades, a broad range of soft, flowing chiffon dresses and candy-colored short suits with exposed seams, perhaps influenced by Gilles Dufour's years at Chanel. Evening had a distinctly '80s flavor: Acid orange, fuchsia and green minidresses shared the runway with feathered tops, handkerchief slips with trains that served as scarves and paillette gowns. And who better to show them all off than Claudia Schiffer?</p></div>"
12,spring,2000,s2000,bcbg-max-azria,"For his Spring collection, BCBG designer Max Azria did just what he does best, distilling the season's major trends into fashion that's utterly wearable and accessible. Ecru, rust, raspberry, and mint green were the predominant shades, with floral prints and beading adding an ethnic touch. Suede skirts, dresses, and shells with appliqués looked great worn with lacquer boots and heels, while skimpy apron tops, layered multi-tulle skirts, and enamel cotton dresses embroidered with paillettes gave an extra spark to the sophisticated, sexy spirit of the collection.</p></div>"
13,spring,2000,s2000,betsey-johnson,"""Freedom Girls"" was the theme for Betsey Johnson's rambunctious, colorful presentation, set to DJ Mark Ronson's funky beats. And true to theme, the real-life models, ranging in age from ten years old to fifty something, who stalked the makeshift runway in Johnson's Seventh Avenue neon-pink and yellow showroom did radiate a sense of fashion, liberation. Johnson's signature playful prints showed up in sexy baby doll halters, micro-cardigans, peasant skirts, and simple sheath dresses. ""Farm girl"" looks mingled with western ensembles of flared jeans with ruffles, and middle eastern-inspired shawls and skirts. ""This is a celebration of personal style,"" declared Johnson, who also served as the show's emcee.</p></div>"
14,spring,2000,s2000,bill-blass,"The audience gave an enthusiastic standing ovation at the end of Bill Blass' historic final presentation. It was a well-deserved send-off for a true master of American fashion, who has decided to retire after decades of designing glorious American sportswear. His swan-song offered plenty of Blass favorites: floral organza strapless dresses, embroidered sweater and skirt sets and clean, sophisticated suits in black and ivory. There were also some fun, youthful twists in his farewell collection, including zebra-print column gowns, beaded hot pants, and bold tops and skirts in vivid shades of aqua, red and pink. It was a fitting finale for one of this country's best designers.</p></div>"
15,spring,2000,s2000,blumarine,"""Two-thousand-and-one nights: global chic"" was the inspiration for Anna Molinari's raucously festive Blumarine collection. Wandering from east to west on a magic fur-trimmed, bejeweled carpet, the designer toyed with bikinis in cashmere and sequins as evening wear; urban <em>tailleurs</em> were alternated with her signature feminine knits. Ethnic motifs appeared everywhere in the form of beaded dragon appliques, Indian-style embroidery and African zebra prints. Pushing the decoration envelope to the max, Molinari turned the rose, Blumarine's symbol, into the leitmotif for a rich series of evening dresses that dripped with waterfalls of the flower's shiny petals.</p></div>"
16,spring,2000,s2000,bottega-veneta,"Bottega Veneta showed a line of simple, easygoing separates, including shimmery coral tops, ecru leather pantsuits and beaded cardigans. But in keeping with the luxury leather house's roots, the true stars of the show were their signature handbags, which came down the runway with nearly every outfit. There were oversized carry-alls, simple clutches, and large, square hard cases in sophisticated taupe as well as spring's essential colors: lime green and pink.</p></div>"
17,spring,2000,s2000,bruce,"Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli, the girls behind Bruce, held an inspirational, glamorous and seductive presentation centered around sumptuous leather skirts and jackets, ruched tanks and no-nonsense trousers. The pieces successfully walked the fine line between avant-garde minimalism and jet-set glamour: Slate-gray satin cocktail dresses shared the runway with crocheted tops and leather pants with gathered cuffs. The sobriety of the designs extended to the classic boots and snakeskin heels that blended in perfectly with the collection.</p></div>"
18,spring,2000,s2000,burberry-prorsum,"Designer Roberto Menechetti's new take on an old British house was more feminine and fun than in previous seasons. There were sexy, double-breasted biker jackets in sueded leather that looked like they had been biking for years, cute mini dresses in a ""new"" Burberry check (it has the old camel-and-red colorway with a lino feel to the print), long, flowing skirts in iridescent lilac silk and macs in ultra-light sailcloth printed with the new check on a lilac or green background. It was an identifiably Burberry collection, but Menechetti seems to be getting closer to a modern British style.</p></div>"
19,spring,2000,s2000,byblos,"""Judo Jetson blends my favorite cartoon character with spiritual Japanese influences,"" said John Bartlett about the opening part of his Byblos show, which featured white and black linen jackets with tie waistbands, sharply tailored capri pants and asymmetrical skirts. The clean, almost clinical looks eventually gave way to an array of satin pieces with geometric designs in shades of turquoise, pink and pale blue, often paired with crisp gray pants and jackets. Bartlett's inspiration? ""The second part of the collection was all about Jackie O. on acid,"" he explained. Of course—who wouldn'ave guessed it?</p></div>"
20,spring,2000,s2000,calvin-klein-collection,"Fashion's king of minimalism showed a romantic, ethereal collection that played with almost imperceptible variations of light and pattern. Colors went from white to putty and pale blue to light gray in fabrics that were sheer and airy. Sophisticated coats and jackets were treated like redefined button-down shirts. Suits were feather-light but tailored razor-sharp, and classic dresses with built-in underwire bras brought the collection into the new millennium with the use of technologically advanced materials like micro-pinstripe opaque jersey.</p></div>"
21,spring,2000,s2000,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera took a playful turn for spring 2000, displaying a youthful, modern feeling that was balanced by her trademark ladylike sophistication. Never one to take fashion over the top, Herrera featured plenty of luscious colors, including beaded pink and chartreuse camisoles and dresses, rich Moroccan embroideries, and buttery-soft suede trousers. The evening looks brought to mind a daring debutante: citron silk crepe backless halter gowns, full taffeta skirts, and ruffled shirts paired with floor-length A-line skirts. ""The mood for 2000 is feminine, luxurious and seductive,"" explained Herrera. ""We need a lot of color and energy.""</p></div>"
22,spring,2000,s2000,celine,"Getaway glamour was the theme for Celine's striking presentation: Jennifer Lopez meets Jackie O. in St. Tropez, of course, for fun in the sun. Duran Duran blared on the speakers as Michael Kors sent out a procession of hand-bleached silk denim ensembles--a new and luxurious take on acid wash, that reliable '80s favorite, this time around with matching oversized travel bags. Dresses and tops in suede and jersey followed. The fabrics were as light and easy to wear as the colors Kors favored: watercolor blue, pale turquoise and bright chartreuse. Kors' penchant for easy luxury extended to the glove-leather vests, chrome-studded cashmere T-shirts, and crystal-encrusted sarongs--which would work equally well on the beach or as evening wear by a bonfire. The accessories were no less striking: clear Lucite bracelets, stiletto mules and, of course, logo-emblazoned totes. It was an accomplished, playful collection punctuated by Kors' trademark simplicity of design and the richness of the fabrics he employed.</p></div>"
23,spring,2000,s2000,cerruti,"Cerruti has a well-built reputation for producing classically tailored, elegant daywear in top-quality fabrics. Peter Speliopolous, who took over the creative reins from Narciso Rodriguez a couple of seasons ago, has successfully capitalized on the traditional house's strengths, and simultaneously infused the clothes with a younger attitude. This season the look was perfect for a summer picnic on the Riviera: Onionskin jerseys, feminine wraps, delicately ruched dresses, and Spanish-inspired skirts evoked a modern interpretation of an impressionist painting. Cutout designs, paillette accents, and very delicate embroidery on light, simply cut fabrics proved how the combination of American sensibility with European tradition and craft is working at Cerruti.</p></div>"
24,spring,2000,s2000,chalayan,"Looking at Hussein Chalayan's work is a bit like looking at a painting by an old master—you know immediately who painted it, and that it is the work of a great artist. This show, which opened with dresses with voluminous skirts of multiple gores, was the work of a fashion master. Chalayan displayed an incredible body of work tonight, from his perfectly executed, simple white dresses with their geometric ruffles at the armhole, to semi-opaque pink slips with frills that skimmed down the bodice of the dress and disappeared under the skirt only to reappear hanging from beneath it. There were several pieces de resistance—an inflatable orange dress that was pumped up on stage, a baby pink moulded plastic dress that was opened up by a remote control panel held by a young boy to reveal a froth of pink tulle underneath, and the grand finale - five models in deconstructed corsets in acid brights and matching pleated skirts. As they stood motionless on stage, the floor literally opened and the girls were swallowed into the depths of the theatre. A great achievement for such a young man, this is the kind of show that will go down as a unique fashion moment.</p></div>"
25,spring,2000,s2000,chloe,"The grandiose Musée du Petit Palais served as the setting for Stella McCartney’s sensual collection. Fringed, frayed, ecru denim pieces opened the show, accessorized by white boots with high heels and bold ankle cuffs. A series of interesting embroidered pieces followed—delicate colored thread formed figures of women and animals on skirts, jeans, and jackets. The collection’s underlying theme of subtle opulence was underscored by the hand-painted jerseys, diamond-embroidered pieces and 24-K-gold chains that held together some tops or served as blouses. For McCartney’s customer, luxury, evidently, comes naturally.</p></div>"
26,spring,2000,s2000,christian-dior,"Couture blaxploitation, logos-a-go-go, leather-clad revolutionaries, whip-toting modern courtesans—where else but at Dior? John Galliano's romp started with a series of wildly sexy denim looks reminiscent of a glammed-out Foxy Brown: knee-high lace-up logo boots, foulard tops made out of Dior's signature print, frayed microskirts and supersexy tan leather pants. Just when you were ready to call the vice squad, out came a parade of eighteenth-century-inspired white, black, and red corsets with lace-up skirts and leggings (asymmetrically cut and with plenty of zippers and laces, of course). Insouciant dance-hall girls in enormous coiffures, velvet ensembles, polka dots, deconstructed suede, whips and satin getups followed. It doesn't get much closer to the fantasy of couture than this—and nobody makes it more fun than Galliano.</p></div>"
27,spring,2000,s2000,christian-lacroix,"It takes a master designer like Christian Lacroix to confidently mix a dizzying array of prints and make it work. Indeed, there was not a single solid piece in Christian Lacroix's strongly decorated collection, but there were plenty of flowers, colorful patchwork, polka dots, paisleys, beading, Kabuki motifs, petal embroidery and giant leaf prints. It was a visually arresting extravaganza that captured the soft, feminine side of spring 2000. If you're in the market for a garden party dress or an eye-catching number for those long summer nights, look no further.</p></div>"
28,spring,2000,s2000,clements-ribeiro,"""It's all about dots,"" said Inacio Ribeiro, who designs with his wife Suzanne Clements, of his collection. The first look out on the runway—a floaty yellow chiffon dress covered with multicolored dots and worn over a dotted bikini—was a strong opening for the collection. There were to-die-for lily-print coats, paisley chiffon skirts decorated with cellophane discs, lean trousers tied at the waist with airy chiffon bows and the most original draped sequin tops. And no one will be able to resist the latest Clements cashmere—a twinset combining chocolate and pistachio stripes, which was shown with cropped trousers in that divine pink and peppermint lily print.</p></div>"
29,spring,2000,s2000,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo's designs are normally unsettling at first, somewhat confusing and, ultimately, incomparably beautiful. What begins as an assault on the senses slowly reveals itself as the work of a true artistic genius. For —pring 2000, Kawakubo continued her ongoing experimentation with proportions, layering, pleats and ruffles, creating some of the most original pieces of the season. Ballerina tights were stuffed with layers of chiffon that peeked sheepishly from the girls' thighs. Olive-green army jackets and fatigues were broken down and reconfigured to create flowing skirts and rumpled jackets with displaced shoulders. But at the heart of the collection was a series of shirts and dresses with unexpected abundance of texture and color. Evoking exotic flowers or intricate corals, Kawakubo piled yards of pink, fuchsia and red fabric into bundles of ruffles and pleats that dramatically redefined the silhouette. Flat surfaces suddenly blossomed into enormous volumes. Nothing old, nothing that has been done before—that's Comme des Garçons' mantra, and it's as true now as it's ever been.</p></div>"
30,spring,2000,s2000,costume-national,"""Leather and chiffon"" essentially summarizes Costume National's presentation, which did not stray far from the familiar looks of the season: simple, light, gauzy, often beaded and transparent dresses with plunging necklines and revealing backsides. In this case, they were shown alongside fitted leather coats, miniskirts, and very short suede shorts and skirts. The predominant color was black, though bursts of green, gray, and copper livened up the atmosphere.</p></div>"
31,spring,2000,s2000,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley's dancehall-inspired presentation was held at a ballroom in the New Yorker hotel, where a couple did a brief waltz as a prelude to the show. The colorful collection was divided into four categories, each with its own distinctive feel: ""Hanky Panky"" featured earth-toned and yellow floral-embroidered dresses, painted leather trousers, and cashmere sweaters. ""Acapulco Gold"" included a crisp selection of white caftans, perforated shirts and dresses, and ribbon wraps. ""Snap out of it"" consisted of ultrasexy swimsuits and Op-Art-inspired dresses in white, salmon, and blue. The conclusion was ""Get Lit,"" which showcased party dresses with miniature lights under slinky layers of lace.</p></div>"
32,spring,2000,s2000,daryl-k,"Daryl K is best known for her urban survival gear, but she also has a longstanding obsession with '70s chic. This season she reconciled the two: Daryl's devotees will be glad to know that there are still plenty of hip-hugging, low-slung trousers, hurricane jackets, dark denim skirts and no-nonsense army blousons. But the '70s influence was obvious in her patchwork silk charmeuse kimono tops, sun-ray shirts with elaborate detailing, and ultra-sexy white vintage cotton tanks paired with bikini bottoms. All the looks were shown with simple wood wedges or supple leather no-heeled boots.</p></div>"
33,spring,2000,s2000,dkny,"At Friday's late-night show, Donna Karan's diffusion line, DKNY, celebrated ""the first ten years, the first New York store, the first fragrance and the first season of the millennium."" Indeed, with Boy George spinning the background music and a bevy of celebrities in attendance, the show reeled with festive energy. Karan kept the upbeat feeling both on and off the runway: Boys and girls strutted confidently down the catwalk in flesh-colored suede and leather, orange and acid-green nylon, and snake-embossed prints. For her finale, Karan showed a series of metallic denim pieces that sent the audience out—to her party—with a bang.</p></div>"
34,spring,2000,s2000,dolce-gabbana,"Dolce &amp; Gabbana are determined to party like it's 1999 for as long as they can, and are sparing no resources to do so. A typical look from their runway included a paisley-print transparent top, embroidered tapestry microskirt with oversized diamanté buckle, leopard tights, jewel-fringed boots and a glittering choker. For those who need a little something extra, there were also plenty of polka-dotted chiffon shirts, flapper tops and skirts, oversize fur hats and bags, beaded ties and buckets of rhinestones. Not satisfied? Slip into their teetering platform shoes, throw on a bejeweled bikini and top it off with a slouchy suit with shimmery appliqués. That should do the trick!</p></div>"
35,spring,2000,s2000,donna-karan,"Spring 2000 for Donna Karan revolved around the concept of ""Fusion—between the past and the future, the body and fabrics, the ancient arts of the East and the modern pace of the West."" As usual, Karan kept the palette elementary: indigo, black, nude and ivory showed up on soft jackets, scarf-like shirts and chic suits. Paper-thin kimonos and nude-colored suedes looked clean and modern, while hand-painted floral chiffons added a sensual feeling to the evening styles.</p></div>"
36,spring,2000,s2000,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten strayed from the mainstream, as he often does, and showed a strong and directional line for Spring 2000. ""I wanted to create a collection about passion and love, something to prove that intensity is not necessarily about women with tight clothes and high heels,"" he explained. Instead, Van Noten created visions of femininity enveloped in voluminous skirts reminiscent of Spain and the south of France, delicately embroidered tops and wool shawls that could be wrapped asymmetrically around the body. Bright, contrasting colors added a youthful touch to the inspired designs.</p></div>"
37,spring,2000,s2000,ellen-tracy,"""There's a fresh, younger look to my collection this season,"" said designer Linda Allard before the Ellen Tracy show. ""Khaki pants and skirts are shorter, and we've incorporated a lot of color as well. The collection looks great with a sculpted, modern high heel and a simple gold link chain."" Other highlights included fire-engine red trenchcoats and shirts; linen knit tops; and jade, lilac and lavender jackets, wraps and tanks. Evening wear revolved around a colorful series of frosted beaded pants, slip dresses and long skirts in grape, cherry, yellow and pink.</p></div>"
38,spring,2000,s2000,elspeth-gibson,"Elspeth Gibson's look is as wearable as it is sweetly sexy. The dress-of-the-moment is either a white fitted broderie anglais shift or a soft silk frock printed with hot-pink flowers on a chocolate background. Sequined sweaters, lime-green chiffon skirts that dipped at the hem, gingham bikinis or skirts that revealed lots of leg, and crystal-covered halter dresses will make for a sublime summer wardrobe. Take it to St. Tropez.</p></div>"
39,spring,2000,s2000,emporio-armani,"""The Emporio Armani woman for the year 2000 is imaginative, eclectic, optimistic and self-assured,"" declared Giorgio Armani. His ideal woman, evidently, is also dressed in technologically advanced fabrics brushed with lacquered strokes; she is mad for pastels, from pink to aquamarine and sage; and she layers her clothing in a thoroughly modern way. Jackets were light and deconstructed, with simple details in contrasting color lace and snaps. Slim and refined pants were worn under semi-transparent skirts and sarongs; tanks were sexy and provocative, some with open backs, others elegant and long-sleeved. Armani's Emporio collection underscored once again the designer's uncanny ability for restrained innovation.</p></div>"
40,spring,2000,s2000,eric-bergere,"""Broadway Garnier"" was the theme for Eric Bergère's collection of <em>tailleurs,</em> flowing skirts with pleats, knit sweaters and ruched shirts. The intent may have been theatrical, but the result was '80s-inspired. There was an assortment of frayed denim pieces, shiny paisley shirts with long scarves, cocktail slips, and fringed bandeau tops. It seems as though Bergère, who is noted for the polish and sophistication of his work, was exploring new directions this season.</p></div>"
41,spring,2000,s2000,fendi,"Karl Lagerfeld presented one of the strongest collections of the season, propelling Fendi once and for all into the center of the fashion limelight. Their trademark accessories--snakeskin baguette purses, acid-colored totes and luxurious foulards--were impeccable as usual, but it was the clothes that took over the stage and captivated the audience. Lagerfeld toyed with the interaction between soft, flowing fabrics in feminine colors and shapes, and the hard-edged glamour of a Halston-clad Studio 54 diva. The result was an innovative, perfectly balanced silhouette. One-sleeved cocktail dresses, shiny patent leather with lace detailing, logo-emblazoned suits, sexy chiffon dresses, enormous driving sunglasses and futuristic metallic heels make up the wardrobe of the modern Fendi woman--a sophisticate who feels equally at home sipping cocktails at a garden party in Milan, attending a gala in New York or nightclub-hopping until dawn in Los Angeles.</p></div>"
42,spring,2000,s2000,genny,"Josephus Thimister successfully brought his sense of lofty experimentation to Genny in a collection inspired by Martha Graham's philosophy of dance. The emphasis was on body movement and the synergy between grace and strength. This became apparent through Thimister's choice of fabrics—fluorescent leather trousers and silk jersey tops contrasted with ballerina dresses in tulle and mousseline. Volume was achieved through the use of artful folds and gathering, and the palette was kept graphic and simple—black and white were the basic colors, enlivened with occasional crescendos of caramel, pink, orange and yellow. In all, Genny's show played like a well-balanced symphony of complementary opposites.</p></div>"
43,spring,2000,s2000,gianfranco-ferre,"Those who lust for the elaborate fantasy and craftsmanship of couture but who prefer prêt-à-porter will find a niche for their whimsical fantasies at Ferre. If there was ever a collection that exemplified unflinching, maximalist resolve, this is it. Ferre's background as an architect was apparent in his use of constructed bodices, grand ballroom skirts with wire underpinnings, origami-inspired dresses and dandyish suits with oversized cuffs. Decoration was, of course, a defining element for the entire collection, ranging from generous ruffles on shirts to beads on floor-grazing skirts and enormous floral appliqués on elaborate dresses. Not a collection for the faint of heart.</p></div>"
44,spring,2000,s2000,giorgio-armani,"Armani proposed a light, feminine silhouette for the new millennium, inspired by the lines and colors of Kandinsky. Sea foam, fuchsia, and lime chiffon infused his collection with a delicate dreaminess. But the Armani woman is as practical as she is ethereal, so there were also plenty of pinstriped wool pants, polished linens, and classic tops. The real innovation came in how models wore the pieces: short jackets were shown with low-waisted pants cropped at the ankle, sarongs were overlapped or doubled and floral dresses were paired with tie-dyed cashmere. Armani's explanation: ""The real woman of 2000 does not want to be hostage to the rules of fashion. She wants the freedom to create her own look with passion and a sense of self-fulfillment."" Enough said.</p></div>"
45,spring,2000,s2000,givenchy,"""Bangee sportswear with '80s influence"" could be a way of describing Alexander McQueen's show for Givenchy, staged in what was set up to look like a gymnasium complete with winner's podium and high-powered fans to blow up the models' ponytailed manes. Most of the collection was made up of tracksuits with high heels, but there was also a white leather boilersuit, sexy black pantsuits with yellow stitching, and a leather patchwork coat in brown, acid-green and white. Boxing and athletic uniform influences showed up on nylon bomber jackets, sports mesh tank dresses and blue sweaters with a sporty yellow stripe.</p></div>"
46,spring,2000,s2000,gucci,"Sex sells, and no one knows that better than Tom Ford, who declared that Spring 2000 was about ""Farrah Fawcett and Blondie, with a touch of Gwyneth Paltrow."" Indeed, Gucci's catwalk sizzled with glamorous vixens swathed in python prints, leather trainer pants and sparkling jersey dresses—a movie star's dream wardrobe, circa 1979. This is certainly not the time to be shy with your clothing. Ford also showed leather jumpsuits, fitted pants with flared legs, strappy bathing suits with barely-there running shorts, and super-shiny shirts worn unbuttoned under fitted jackets. Bright-pink hosiery, stone-encrusted sandals and oversized sunglasses underscored the rock-star dimension of the unbridled glamfest.</p></div>"
47,spring,2000,s2000,helmut-lang,"Lang played with tailoring and flouthroughout this collection, and sometimes within a single outfit. Erin O’Connor, for example, wore jeans and a single-breasted topper from which floated a sheer panel. Shorts and sleeveless dresses had balloon hems, and feathers sprouted from heels of shoes. Bombshell Stephanie Seymour looked every inch the lady in a short and stunning off-the-shoulder dress.</p></div>"
48,spring,2000,s2000,hermes,"A so-called “conceptual” designer, Martin Margiela was focused on transforming objects (upcycling) and linking the present and the past as he had observed his mother doing with restored furniture. For his own line, he had famously resized vintage doll clothing to human proportions. At Hermès, the designer’s attachment to the past was less visually marked and more connected with tradition. Curator Kaat Debo notes an exception when she explains that the very dapper and practical-looking detachable saddle pockets shown for Spring 2000 were inspired by the removable pockets worn with 18th-century pannier gowns.</p><p>With its striped sweaters, espadrilles, and a classic-looking trench, this comfortable and contemporary collection had a subtle French inflection that was directed at the modern Parisienne, not latter-day Marie Antoinettes. In fact, although Margiela consistently eschewed the obvious markers of status associated with Hermès, he publicly nodded to the history of the house by including in his runway cast the style icon Jane Birkin, who gave her name to one of the house’s best-selling bags.</p></div>"
49,spring,2000,s2000,iceberg,"Iceberg, which was brimming with youthful energy, was inspired by the topic of love. Lilac, orange, red, gold and white were the colors of choice for a broad range of silhouettes--there were '70s flared pants with appliqués, macro and miniskirts, Chaplinesque trousers and elaborate knits, most with glittering paillettes thrown in for good measure. It was a lighthearted collection that should easily find a niche in Iceberg's new Las Vegas boutique.</p></div>"
50,spring,2000,s2000,jean-colonna,"Colonna's idea of chic is certainly not that of the haute bourgeoisie: Instead think smoky nightclubs, too much to drink and illicit romances. His slinking sensibility showed up this season in fringed, semi-destroyed denim ensembles, belted handkerchief tops with lace insets, net T-shirt dresses and paillette-trimmed rock 'n' roll ensembles with revealing slashed cutouts. Without forgoing all the hard-edged glitz, Colonna also featured some of his trademark favorites--sweaters with exposed seams, deconstructed layering and reconfigured garments.</p></div>"
51,spring,2000,s2000,jean-paul-gaultier,"<em>The Love Boat</em> was Jean Paul Gaultier's inspiration for a campy cruise through vacation wear. His island runway came complete with sand, leaves, a palm tree and a little pond for models to take a dip. Vampish ocean-liner mavens with '70s coiffures opened the show with an array of boldly printed tops adorned with silk-screened faces. Recalling a tropical paradise, flowing white dresses with ruffled hems and sleeves followed. Meanwhile, some girls were fortunate enough to have with them those shipwreck essentials: cut-off shorts and miniskirts worn over bloomers. The sweet maidens were soon overcome by romantic pirates toting foulards, bandeau tops and tulle chemises. How did it all end? Glamour to the rescue, of course, in the form of black long dresses gathered at the waist and acid-colored chiffon gowns.</p></div>"
52,spring,2000,s2000,jeremy-scott,"Jeremy Scott's presentation was a brilliant finale for the collections--and a witty reply to all his detractors, who had accused him in the past of producing outlandish clothing that no one would wear. Scott encapsulated--and took a step further--the dominating themes of the season: easy luxury, '80s references and working woman sexiness. His show opened with a series of strong-shouldered tan trenches, wrap dresses and blazer suits. ""Perfect for power lunches or PTA meetings,"" said Scott, who acted as emcee. Sharply commenting on the current branding craze, Scott also produced his own series of travel totes, bags and clutches, and emblazoned them all with his name. After a long day at the office, the girls needed to relax on the tennis court, of course, wearing skimpy powder-blue knit-wrap dresses, sports jackets with removable sleeves and campy visors. And for evening wear, Scott proved that aside from biting humor and talent, he's also got plenty of spunk left. His ""Atlantis divas"" were clad in nearly pornographic pastel chiffon, reminiscent of a Swedish blue-movie starlet circa 1980. Vive <em>l'avant-garde</em>!</p></div>"
53,spring,2000,s2000,jil-sander,"Jil Sander's strength has always been her self-assured simplicity of design. This season she experimented with a lighter, more feminine silhouette that included floral patterns and western shirts. Skirts had gathered waistbands; some dresses featured sash-like pleats on the front. Sander's softer side came through in the lacy chiffons and cottons she used, and in her precise use of color. The runway evoked a procession of sculptural cascades in black and white, with sporadic flashes of brown, beige, rose and yellow.</p></div>"
54,spring,2000,s2000,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart is known for translating the trends for her youthful clientele, making fashion fun and wearable. And her Spring 2000 collection was no exception: Comfortable, frilly tees were worn over jeans with heart-shaped pockets and embroidered detailing. There were also funky white leather bomber jackets, candy-pink camisoles and mint micro-shorts. For evening, Stuart showed pretty pastel column gowns with strappy high-heeled thong sandals that added a sexy footnote.</p></div>"
55,spring,2000,s2000,john-bartlett,"""Charo Meets Che"" was the title of John Bartlett's coed show, inspired by photographer and Mexican revolutionary Tina Modotti. Bartlett's ""Guerrilla Ballerinas"" stormed the runway wearing rust and brown leather slim pants with side laces, bomber jackets, and silk chiffon wrap tops. More formal looks followed, including a black twill luggage coat, georgette pants with gold beading, and gathered nude silk sleeveless tunics.</p></div>"
56,spring,2000,s2000,john-galliano,"Another wild tour de force for Galliano—this time, a musical rundown of the century, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, of course. Dandyish zoot suits—Mafioso style—were shown with spacelike silver overcoats, hats, and bags. Fifties crinolines followed: Galliano's take on romance and innocence, and the beginning of rock. Gingham prints, floral appliqués and extravagant pink volumes alternated with punk and hip-hop inspired getups: combat boots, bondage straps (albeit covered in paillettes) and slashed dresses. Galliano's main virtue is his whimsical ability to retrace and appropriate different periods of fashion history. It wasn't always easy to grasp all the references, but the extravagant and accomplished creations left the audience reeling in their seats.</p></div>"
57,spring,2000,s2000,julien-macdonald,"Macdonald's talent lies with knitwear and fiber, and he didn't let his fans down. Out came PVC jeans decorated with silver studs, plasticlike fabrics painted with pale pinks and blues, a golden sweater with woven-in crystals so it sparkled, and sweaters in lime, fuchsia and silver stripes. Very disco, very out there. Very Julien.</p></div>"
58,spring,2000,s2000,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s collection was nothing short of an epiphany: one of those rare fashion moments when creative genius, artistic integrity, and down-to-earth sensibility come together as one. The show opened with two girls running down the rained-on runway, protected only by their dainty foulards and beautifully simple shift robes. Each took turns unfastening the seams on the sides and turning the front of her dress onto itself, revealing a different color and print—in fact, two looks in one. Blending function and delicate beauty was the leitmotiv for Watanabe’s entire presentation. There were waterproof skirts (equipped with a hidden protective plastic layer), wrap-around scarves that upon closer inspection proved to be attached to a dress or skirt, gloriously pleated wraps and futuristic headpieces. It was a seamless display of refinement, architectural construction and clarity of vision that relied on technologically advanced fabrics and techniques coupled with Watanabe’s impeccably pure sense of style.</p></div>"
59,spring,2000,s2000,lanvin,"Cristina Ortiz presented a subtle yet striking collection for Lanvin, with her famously slim, sleek trousers taking center stage. They were done in black, lilac, red and cocoa, in fabrics ranging from canvas to leather to coated cotton. The highlight was a stunning beaded pair that faded from hazelnut to green. Ortiz also created sharp leather jackets, fitted shirtdresses, and practical jacquard dresses with ruched necks and waistlines. For her finale, Ortiz sent out a series of colorful evening gowns with appliqués resembling glittering broken tiles.</p></div>"
60,spring,2000,s2000,lawrence-steele,"Amid the sea of dainty decoration that has been the prevailing theme for Spring 2000 so far, Lawrence Steele's raw, sexy collection added a welcome dose of unadulterated energy. Models reminiscent of Helmut Newton's '70s glamour girls strutted down the catwalk wearing graphic black-and-white animal prints, studded skirts and transparent tops. Striking leather jackets and dresses were set off by accents of shocking pink and orange; detailing included large paillettes, feathers and gold piping on bare-back dresses. Steele offered the perfect look for those late nights you can't remember too well the next morning.</p></div>"
61,spring,2000,s2000,loewe,"White was the overwhelmingly dominant color at Loewe, with sporadic splashes of tan, sapphire, and yellow. Buttery leathers and suedes gave an opulent edge to form-fitting jeans, sexy jumpsuits and beaded overcoats. There were also delicate shift dresses, practical vests with zippers and python ensembles. For evening, Narciso Rodriguez showed a series of suede and leather dresses encrusted with glittering crystals. Overall, it was an unencumbered, consistent collection that did not forget Loewe's tradition of simple and luxurious chic.</p></div>"
62,spring,2000,s2000,louis-vuitton,"It was a veritable tour de force for Marc Jacobs who, after showing his own line in New York, presented an impressively honed collection for Louis Vuitton. Travel and luxury have always been essential components of the Vuitton allure, and this season it looks like jet-setters will feel equally at home on their way to a safari in Africa or hopping on the Concorde between New York and Paris. Canvas skirts, trenchcoats, and jackets stamped with LV's mini-monogram were reminiscent of a luxury-starved colonial explorer's uniform, as were the wool denim pieces and oversize bags. For more urban tastes, Jacobs produced a series of fluid silk jersey dresses with graphic prints, gold skirts and coats, and cashmere tops with scarves. The overall feeling was of easy, eminently wearable chic—adornment was restricted to very subtle diamond stitching on pants and skirts, and occasional embroidery on tanks and evening gowns.</p></div>"
63,spring,2000,s2000,maison-martin-margiela,"This was the first of a pair of shows focused on overblown proportions applied to wardrobe staples like trenchcoats, men’s shirts, bombers, and slip dresses, all of which were enlarged by 148, 150, or 200 percent.  But size wasn’t Margiela’s only concern for Spring ’00: Carefully placed price stickers and electronic security tags  commented on the marketing and selling of fashion, as well. What the de-heeled  shoes were meant to say is less clear. The collection was served up not on a runway but, commented <em><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/style/review-fashion-from-kittens-to-kilts-to-hacked-heels.html"">The New York Times</a></em>, “on round tabletops in a room that looked set up for a Rotarian dinner.”</p></div>"
64,spring,2000,s2000,marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs has long been a fashion-insider favorite, and with his collection, shown late Monday night at the New York Armory, he once again proved why. His Spring 2000 line is sure to become one of the most important collections of the season. The mood of the clothes was evocative of a California surfer girl on holiday in a Parisian discotheque circa 1979: canvas trousers with green and red piping were paired with poor boy cashmere T-shirts; Nimes denim pants, sundresses, and skirtsuits looked crisp and fresh with striped gauze tops. The clean and simple lines were thrown occasional accents—like paillette trimming on green cotton satin pea jackets, spotted dresses, and striped trousers. The overall feeling: effortless, understated chic.</p></div>"
65,spring,2000,s2000,marni,"Marni's presentation relied on youthful and easy-to-wear dresses and separates in bright pink, green and yellow over white and beige. Polka dots and abstract motifs in light cotton dominated, but there were also flowing country-girl skirts with subtle embroidery and traditional gingham prints. The translucent layering of light fabrics added a playful touch to the feminine silhouette. The look was completed with flat shoes and boots—some of which were also decorated with eye-catching polka dots.</p></div>"
66,spring,2000,s2000,martine-sitbon,"Sitbon gathered many of the season's predominant themes and reworked them into her own collection: Transparent fabrics layered with shine, paillette appliqués, fringed trims, and pleating all showed up in her work. Leather skirts with geometric patchwork inserts were interesting, and there were a few easy-to-wear trench coats. The colors were mostly rosy pastels, black and white, but a series of pieces, reminiscent of the Russian deconstructivists, incorporated red and aqua insets as well.</p></div>"
67,spring,2000,s2000,matt-nye,"Designer Matt Nye's sophomore show featured a coed collection centered around navy sailor pants, fitted jackets and simple cotton polo shirts. The theme seemed to be a cross between sophisticated urban staples and relaxed resort wear: There were waterproof ponchos, drawstring paratrooper pants, nautical tees, and boat-neck pullovers. Levi's 501s and Converse sneakers added a classically retro touch to the overall look.</p></div>"
68,spring,2000,s2000,matthew-williamson,"Take a London girl and send her on a trip—through Bali, Goa, and Ibiza—and you have Matthew Williamson's glamorous and seductive vision of a well-dressed gypsy. Williamson's hot fringed-at-the-bottom red suede dress, hand-painted white leather frock and sari tops decorated with neon embroidery and glistening sequins were instant hits. Watch out for his photo print T-shirts covered with jeweled flowers and the newest take on the vest top—purple cashmere with a neon-yellow trim at the arm. Hot stuff for the well-heeled downtown girl.</p></div>"
69,spring,2000,s2000,max-mara,"Khaki, burgundy, lavender, and navy blue were the predominating colors at MaxMara. It was a simple, controlled collection that worked—thanks to the precision of the form-fitting pantsuits, sexy shorts, and luxurious denim ensembles. Studded overcoats, pleated skirts and transparent shirts were both practical and sharp; graphic sweaters with geometric motifs, and a series of shiny pink snakeskin pieces added a dash of excitement to the runway. The chemisiers, smoky glasses, skinny belts, and fitted blazers confirmed that 70s glamour is here to stay—at least for a while.</p></div>"
70,spring,2000,s2000,michael-kors-collection,"""Palm Bitch"" was the inspiration for Michael Kors's extravagant and luxurious cavalcade of tangerine, lemon and bright-pink looks. There were familiar Kors favorites like jersey shifts (this time in Lilly Pulitzer-like acid-colored floral patterns) and sumptuous cashmere cable pullovers in bright yellow and white. Buttery leather skirts were embroidered and paired with simple tanks, while zebra prints made unexpected appearances in everything from cotton shifts to bikinis and cabana shirts. For an evening of uncomplicated glamour, Kors offered slinky jersey columns, nude beaded gowns and seafoam-colored halters.</p></div>"
71,spring,2000,s2000,missoni,"A continuous flow of color and patterns in light fabrics was the key design element for Angela Missoni, whose signature prints looked better than ever in this season filled with decoration. It was a feminine collection defined by soft forms and geometric, colorful patterns. Optical waves of yellow, turquoise, orange and lime suggested a seaside stay on Capri, while zigzag brushstrokes of black and white brought an urban touch to the mix. Evening was defined by a series of nocturnal landscapes with rhinestone appliqués on airy, chiffon knit column-dresses.</p></div>"
72,spring,2000,s2000,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada confirmed, once again, that she is one of the greatest creative talents in fashion at the moment. Her new Miu Miu line, aptly entitled ""Almost a Lady,"" was an intelligent play on the discreet charm of the modern—and young—bourgeoisie. Classic prep ensembles were reinvented with '90s shine, attitude and confidence. Pleated skirts were worn with colorful mules, baseball jackets were outfitted with patent leather detailing, and pale slacks and skirts were dressed up with diamond detailing. The looks never seemed forced or over-the-top; indeed, the collection's greatest strength was the masterful balance between embellishment and function. These are the types of clothes that women can wear everyday, anywhere, with the self-assured certainty that they'll never be underdressed—or overdone.</p></div>"
73,spring,2000,s2000,moschino,"Girls just wanted to have fun at Moschino's riotous festival of colors and prints. An assortment of references evoked everything from a psychedelic Peter Pan to a neo-dandy cabaret singer and a country-western drifter on Route 66. The runway was a no-holds-barred orgy of pirate caricature dresses, sailor pants, deluxe hippie dresses, ruffled shirts (worn with big-buckled buccaneer belts and extravagant headpieces), closely fitted waistcoats and acid-tinted snakeskin. Young sartorial divas should have no problem finding a broad selection of outfits here to drive Mother insane.</p></div>"
74,spring,2000,s2000,narciso-rodriguez,"There were no unnecessary frills at Narciso Rodriguez, whose black and white collection relied on the strength of his precise cut, layered silhouettes and subtle beading. Grecian-inspired bias jersey dresses and tops looked refined and sexy, as did his ultra-thin mohair sweaters worn over gauze tops and sleek cotton trousers. Rodriguez artfully played with a variety of transparencies and forms to create an ethereal effect: Dresses were worn over each other, and beaded cashmere gowns were paired with bias slips. But there was also an edgier side to Rodriguez's show: Leather trenches, a dress decorated with staples and a few candy-colored tops confirmed that Rodriguez can successfully address his customers' needs for sophisticated dressing, while indulging their tough-girl chic cravings.</p></div>"
75,spring,2000,s2000,nicole-miller,"""Daydreams"" was the inspiration for Miller's show, which was defined by unbridled decoration. Beaded tube tops in magenta, chartreuse and yellow were worn with georgette ruffled skirts; contrasting patterns complemented each other within the same outfit. Aqua tanks were featured alongside turquoise leopard skirts, and hand-painted organza cap-sleeved shirts were paired with crocheted skirts. Among the standout evening looks: long tartan skirts and shiny blue trousers.</p></div>"
76,spring,2000,s2000,nyc-2000,"Mayor Rudy Giuliani saluted the New York City fashion industry with an open-air show in the middle of Times Square Monday night, complete with giant TV screens and a musical performance by Grammy Award winner Trisha Yearwood. Nearly 90 designers participated, each showing only one or two looks. Models walked down a makeshift runway in rapid succession (Lauren Hutton, modeling an Armani velvet pantsuit, received an enthusiastic round of applause) as gridlock-causing crowds gathered to watch in the surrounding streets.</p></div>"
77,spring,2000,s2000,olivier-theyskens,"According to Olivier Theyskens, his Spring 2000 show, “will always remain very important because somehow I brought a lot of restriction in my choices creatively and I really worked with a very narrow palette.” Blacks, whites, and muddy tones, were brightened by splashes of white and yellow, and the designer created optical illusions working with Taroni’s outsized check and polka dot prints. Just as the models were supposed to appear lost between earth and sky as they walked on a soil-covered runway with a cloudy sky projected above them, so Theyksens was drawn both to floaty chiffons and fabrics with a heavier hand, like coated linens and others resembling a painter’s canvas.</p><p>His main jumping off point was an antique find from the early 1900s: “a very light, trench-shaped silk coat that inspired most of my tailoring with these little shirrings at the shoulder, these little curvy edges to the collars,” Theyskens says now. It wasn’t only the tailoring that was soft in this collection though; Theyskens introduced his first bias-cut pieces this season. “I loved the material first,” he recalls, “and then I just was curious how it would work; I just wanted some more fluidity.”</p></div>"
78,spring,2000,s2000,oscar-de-la-renta,"""My first collection of the millennium celebrates female strength,"" explained Oscar de la Renta. ""This is the first time in fashion history that professional women can dress very femininely and use that to their advantage."" True to his words, de la Renta showed stylishly embroidered leather skirts in camel, pink and yellow; double-faced denim pantsuits worn with cashmere shells; and Kelly-green silk and shantung dresses. For evening, there was an array of Ottoman-inspired gowns, embroidered strapless gowns, and silk tulle ballerina skirts. Oversized jewelry added the final touch.</p></div>"
79,spring,2000,s2000,philosophy,"Ferretti has always relied on youthful femininity as the inspiration for her Philosophy collections—and Spring 2000 was no exception. The predominant look was that of a sweet country girl on safari: easy-going day dresses in olive green, beige, gold and white; peasant skirts with delicate ruffles; patchwork-embroidered gauzy tops; and ultra-soft suede pants accessorized with no-nonsense rubber boots. But even the most practical-minded expeditionary craves a touch of glamour, and Ferretti delivered the goods with '60s-style gold mesh sleeveless dresses, beaded hot pants, embroidered tops, and coppery capri pants.</p></div>"
80,spring,2000,s2000,prada,"Miuccia Prada showed today what is certain to become one of the most influential and successful collections of the season. It was an exquisite show of chic and glamour, tempered by the designer's signature discretion. Burgundy shorts and sweaters, lipstick prints, polka dot shirts, leather skirts and boldly colored turtlenecks evoked a cosmopolitan panache not seen since the jet-set '70s and early '80s; some looks were accessorized with sizeable travel bags and large sunglasses. For those in search of the perfect summer robe, there were also demure, semi-transparent dresses with masterful pleats and lingerie-inspired detailing that begged for relaxed cocktails in the country. ""The ABC of fashion,"" was how Prada summed up her collection. It is precisely this knack for endowing classic, seemingly normal clothes with masterful fashion sense that keeps her empire going—and the audience begging for more.</p></div>"
81,spring,2000,s2000,ralph-lauren,"""Jackie O. meets Brigitte Bardot"" would be a fitting description for Ralph Lauren's latest collection, which featured numerous styles stitched up in gingham and polka dots. ""This is for a woman who understands how sexy simplicity can be,"" explained the ever-discerning designer. His palette was heavy on black, white and red, which showed up in taffeta pants and tops, gabardine jackets and skimpy shorts. There were also georgette floral skirts and camisoles, and sensational leather jeans. Overall, Lauren's strong collection worked beautifully by defying conventional rules.</p></div>"
82,spring,2000,s2000,randolph-duke,"It seemed only appropriate that Miss Universe and Miss America were seated front-row center at Randolph Duke's heavily bejeweled presentation. Navy blue, white and silver were the predominant colors, highlighted with sporadic bursts of maroon and powder blue. Duke drew inspiration from the Marines, picking up sailor-pant detailing on long skirts and trousers that were shown with tube knits, Celtic cable cardigans and turtlenecks. The lineup for evening was a nonstop procession of floor-length gowns lavished with beading, sequins and embroidery.</p></div>"
83,spring,2000,s2000,rebecca-danenberg,"""My collection is based on clean, nude fabrics and knits,"" said Rebecca Danenberg before her show. Danenberg's vision was clearly a sexy one, hailing back to the decadent disco days: There were filmy, mosaic-printed chiffon tops, flesh-colored leather strapless dresses, liquid tunics with silver chain belts and powder-blue ruffled dresses. With the exception of the leather pieces, shine dominated the runway, with fabrics that shimmered with every step the models took. These were not clothes for the faint of heart.</p></div>"
84,spring,2000,s2000,robert-cary-williams,"Imagine an off-blue, tailored leather pantsuit. Then imagine its collars held together with a knifelike slice of mirrored glass, and you can see why Robert Cary-Williams' third runway show held everyone's attention. A young designer who has previously shown on runways banging with explosions, Cary-Williams stayed true to his inspirations—molded leather that he bakes in an oven and deconstructed tailoring. Jackets were crafted in butter-colored or cloud gray leather with detailed topstitching and seaming, while dresses were trimmed with leather or zips. Trousers were beautifully deconstructed to fall away into skirts and many jackets were completely backless. If Cary-Williams couldn't resist a few art school moments, like a dress made entirely of mirrors, the star piece—an organza dress decorated with zips that unraveled down Kate Moss' bared back—proved this designer has a unique vision that should be watched.</p></div>"
85,spring,2000,s2000,ruffo-research,"A.F. Vandervoorst took over the reigns at Ruffo Research this year from Raf Simons and Veronique Branquinho, who had imbued the traditional leather goods company with a more experimental edge. The transition couldn't have been smoother: A.F. Vandervoorst’s collection was brave, innovative and brilliant, reworking traditional biker and hospital uniforms into luxurious leather ensembles, some with unexpected details like asymmetrical closures and sleeves, others strikingly simple and clean. Ruffo Research provided a very welcome jolt of inspiration to Milan fashion week; some of their pieces, like the white, paper-thin hospital lab coats, distressed trousers and heavily pleated skirts, are sure to become instant cult classics with the forward-thinking set.</p></div>"
86,spring,2000,s2000,saint-laurent,"""Yves Saint Laurent is not about the past and it's not about the future. It is eminently contemporary,"" said Pierre Bergé before the show began. Truer words could not have been spoken. Alber Elbaz created a collection that perfectly captures the fashion moment ""designed for a woman who desires traditions with a twist, who thinks big and lives fast."" Classic Saint Laurent favorites looked better than ever--tuxedo suits with chiffon shirts, evening dresses brimming with flou français and sexy tops with oversized cowl necks. But there were also sharp new pieces, like a series of semitransparent green, fuchsia, blue and plum suits; hard-edged tan leather dresses; plastic paillette gowns; python overcoats and Amazon-inspired silk shirts with leaf motifs. Clearly, Saint Laurent's strong, gutsy woman is still very much in vogue—and, thankfully, it looks like we'll be seeing plenty of her in the future.</p></div>"
87,spring,2000,s2000,sonia-rykiel,"A flowing, sensual silhouette accented with occasional hard touches has been a recurring motif through Sonia Rykiel's impressive career. This season she geared her collection toward the ""tough, unpredictable, and determined woman."" Rykiel produced a series of flouncy, delicate dresses spiced up with pleats, square necks and lace detailing. The clothes were at times sweet and delicate, but often provocatively sexy, such as the series of rhinestone sweaters, brightly colored rabbit fur bomber jackets and ""crocheted dresses for eccentric ladies"" she showed. Even Rykiel's bride had an edge: Her flowing white gown, like many pieces in the show, was trimmed with metal studs. What about Rykiel's wedding-night accessories? A blue bouquet and tons of attitude, <em>bien sûr</em>.</p></div>"
88,spring,2000,s2000,sportmax,"Sportmax designs simple, easy-to-wear clothes for people who want the look of the moment without taking too many fashion risks. This season revolved around a beach motif, featuring shorts, customized tank tops and sexy bikinis decorated with petals. Simple T-shirts received a glamour boost with paillette detailing, and a Pucci-like print showed up on liquid chiffon skirts and handkerchief shirts. The ""modern nomad"" looks were accessorized with '80s-style sunglasses and gigantic bags—big enough to carry your beach supplies, or your all-important traveling essentials.</p></div>"
89,spring,2000,s2000,strenesse,"Gabrielle Strehle designed for Strenesse a concise line of blouson shirts, off-the-shoulder tops, and slinky dresses in solid shades of white, aqua, gold and tan. The general feeling was reminiscent of California in the '70s, but the final effect was thoroughly contemporary. Soft suede, denim twill and baby cashmere gave the collection an atmosphere of luxury that stemmed from precision of design and refinement of materials rather than overt decoration. Smart details like subtle beading on gold skirts, thin belt straps and ruched necklines packed quite a punch, but were never overdone.</p></div>"
90,spring,2000,s2000,susan-lazar,"Susan Lazar—who's known for creating clean, modern styles—presented a collection of youthful classics at The Altman in Chelsea. The simple, easy-to-wear separates showcased several of the season's prevailing trends, including white canvas coats worn over long silk skirts in shades of olive and rust, camisole dresses in desert rose and canary yellow, and tops and skirts with a decorative touch of Moroccan embroidery.</p></div>"
91,spring,2000,s2000,thimister,"Josephus Thimister's work is striking for its simplicity. Few designers today have the talent—or the desire—to reconfigure traditional notions of acceptable dressing, mix rich materials with pedestrian ones to create hard, striking pieces, and then use them to propose an aesthetic that's undeniably beautiful. Thimister's austere collection featured simple white trenches, dresses and skirts, many with burnt hems; there were rich knit sweaters in brown and aqua, crinkly leather ensembles and shiny black suits. But perhaps most important of all, there was no unnecessary ornamentation—just well-constructed, defiantly modern clothes based on strong creative power. And one good idea is worth more than a thousand misplaced paillettes.</p></div>"
92,spring,2000,s2000,tommy-hilfiger,"Tommy Hilfiger appropriated the current elements of decoration in fashion—beading, assorted prints, and embroidery—stripped them of all frilliness, and used them to rock the house at Madison Square Garden. Bush performed live as a parade of sexy modern-day cowboys and girls took to the runway wearing multi colored eagle bustiers, crimson motorcycle jackets, and jeans with snakeskin appliques. Red, white, and blue was the patriotic, and predominant, color scheme, occasionally tempered by patchwork dresses and floral-printed western looks. Cowboy boots inspired by the American flag added the ideal footnote to Hilfiger's extravagant looks.</p></div>"
93,spring,2000,s2000,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber's talent is with tailoring, particularly in leather and this season this young Saint Martin's graduate delivered an extremely creative and beautiful take on his signature look of seamed leather. Using the veins of a butterly wing as inspiration for his seaming, Webber joined the palest blue leather with chiffons or high-tech knits to create some unbelievably sharp tailoring. There were some to-die-for jackets and coats whose tailoring techniques were as sensous and curvacious as the female body. Webber is a truly original tailor who has to be congratulated for pioneering unique and new techniques that will undoubtedly influence the rest of the fashion world. Pale blue chiffon skirts and dresses, skin tight or looser and printed with flesh-pink 'veins' were wonderfully pretty and feminine. Webber has developed his obsession with the fusion of human anatomy and the anatomy of tailoring to create something less macabre than in previous seasons—in fact, you could call it as elegant as it was edgy.</p></div>"
94,spring,2000,s2000,tse,"Conceptual designer Hussein Chalayan showed a collection of luxurious separates for TSE on Friday afternoon. Based on the idea of ""Shadows,"" Chalayan featured multitone embroidered cotton jackets, dresses and skirts, as well as ultrasoft red cashmere sweaters. Muted color blocks showed up against backdrops of rose ash, marmalade and grey in both tops and skirts. Double-face silk dresses completed the smart, understated presentation.</p></div>"
95,spring,2000,s2000,tuleh,"The design team of Josh Patner and Brian Brantley, better known as Tuleh, showed a perfectly honed collection today. The look was sophisticated, natural and very, very pretty. Floral prints, checks and frou-frou detailing appeared on everything from body-hugging suits to flowing gowns and '50s inspired skirts. Foxy feathered skirts and strapless A-line dresses looked fresh and clean, and were perfectly complemented by the boldly-colored satin pumps that Christian Louboutin designed for Patner and Brantley. Tuleh perfectly captured the season's lust for feminine decoration without ever reverting to artifice or excess.</p></div>"
96,spring,2000,s2000,ungaro-couture,"""Love to love you, baby"" was the soundtrack for most of Ungaro's wildly extravagant ode to the late '70s and early '80s, and it couldn't have been more appropriate. The runway felt like a flashback to Studio 54—glamour girls dancing and slithering onstage in ruffled one-shoulder crepe dresses, airy georgette polka-dot tops and animal-print jerseys in acid colors. Not to mention the parade of nearly fluorescent fuchsia, orange and green disco slips, jungle motifs and extravagantly beaded ensembles. It was a rich, indulgent presentation that felt curiously appropriate in a season that has been continuously hinting at the pleasures of excess. One couldn't help but scan the audience for a sighting of Ivana Trump, and what a thrill to find her seated in the front row! There's no doubt about it—at Ungaro, flash is back, flash is good and flash is cool.</p></div>"
97,spring,2000,s2000,valentino,"Elegant, glamorous and gracefully cut are keywords when speaking of Valentino's work. This season the emphasis was on prints—floral appliqués, ivory polka dots on red crepe and lily of the valley embroideries. There were also some strong, less decorated pieces, like the stunning cashmere coat that opened the show, evocative of Jackie O. Also striking were his accessories: rectangular bags with cascades of beads and spindly high heels decorated with delicate, dainty rosebuds and glittering flowers.</p></div>"
98,spring,2000,s2000,vera-wang,"Vera Wang began her show with pure, modern dresses in white, accented with graphic, geometric patches of silver beading. A series of fluid black pieces followed, and then a procession of beaded pants and skirts, transparent tops and sequined gowns in pastel shades inundated the runway. For the conclusion, Wang offered the expected array of signature wedding gown—an ultraromantic array of dresses punctuated by flowing cathedral-length veils that trailed to the floor.</p></div>"
99,spring,2000,s2000,versace,"Versace's requisite ingredients were all present: sex, bright colors and rock-hard attitude. The volume on the runway was cranked up to 11 as an assortment of Hawaiian prints (not your traditional beach shirts, mind you), Grecian-front slinky dresses, mischievous handkerchief blouses and draped evening gowns flashed by under the strobe lights. Cleavages were deeper than ever, and a jet-set look imbued everything from the strappy bathing suits to the glittery heels and tie-collar blouses. Versace's daring cut, wild use of color and uncensored drama continue to be the label's strongest assets—and Donatella shows no signs of slowing down.</p></div>"
100,spring,2000,s2000,versus-versace,"The mood at the Versus show, which was set to the heart-pounding beats of electronic band Les Rythmes Digitales, was as sexy and extroverted as ever, with celebrities like Madonna, Rupert Everett, and Natasha Richardson seated front row center at the sleek ruby-red runway. White was the dominant color of the collection, accented with quick flashes of pink, gold, lime green, and Caribbean-colored floral prints. Slim, straight-leg trousers and short skirts were shown with slinky honeycomb tops and copper-zip jackets. Delicate embroidery, overlapping layers, lavish beading, and high-heeled boots complemented Donatella Versace's ultra-sexy silhouette.</p></div>"
101,spring,2000,s2000,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro showed a sexy, elegant collection of styles that would look right at home in the Concorde Lounge at Charles de Gaulle. Supple, deep-brown leather skirts, capri pants and skimpy shorts opened the show, followed by aqua shirt-dresses with plunging necklines. Sand-colored, cashmere-knit hot pants were worn under a cotton trench, and simple, creamy leather pants looked great with slinky embroidered tops. For evening, Alfaro featured lilac chiffon skirts, embroidered silk knit tops and crystal beaded dresses.</p></div>"
102,spring,2000,s2000,vivienne-tam,"Hong Kong designer Vivienne Tam's Spring 2000 collection was inspired by dragons, which showed up everywhere from discreet details on waistbands to large sequined representations on dresses. ""I wanted to propose a return to femininity for the twenty-first century,"" explains Tam. Her trademark embroideries were applied to technologically-advanced, iridescent fabrics in hues like ivory, jade and coral. Minimalist jackets were lavishly draped, printed dresses were generously beaded and skirts were dip-dyed in aqua and mint green. Tam designed the kind of wardrobe that will take a chic, young girl-about-town from mother's garden party to the nightclub without skipping a beat.</p></div>"
103,spring,2000,s2000,yohji-yamamoto,"Deconstructing (and then reconfiguring) traditional clothing and silhouettes has always been an essential component of Yamamoto's work, and this season he addressed the issue head-on. A simple white dress opened his show; a virtually identical one, adorned only by a black ruffle on the front followed it; next, it developed a sleeve and side section. Eventually, of course, the outfit was completed with two sleeves and shoulders, though Yamamoto never quite got around to the back. The effect was stunning, as were the beige full skirts with elaborate pleats and voluminous ruffles, feather umbrellas, trench coats and preciously embroidered tops in the lightest possible shades of orange, purple and green. It takes a master of nuance to pull off such a delicate collection—and Yamamoto did it faultlessly.</p></div>"
1,fall,2000,f2000,alberta-ferretti,"Come fall, Alberta Ferretti's girls will be casually strolling up Madison Avenue, sipping cocktails at the Plaza and then heading out for a night on the town. Ferretti showed a full wardrobe of essentials for the quintessential girl-about-town: Wool coats with fur-trimmed sleeves, sheared fur jackets and beaded, layered evening dresses all looked chic. There were also optical-printed tops, croc skirts and tweed suits cinched at the waist with thick metallic bands. The overall effect depended on which shoes the girls wore—Ferretti offered both slim, ladylike heels and perfectly flat riding boots.</p></div>"
2,fall,2000,f2000,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua's presentation kicked off with Alek Wek wearing a simple yet stunning black jersey dress with a flower appliqué on the side. This marked the beginning of a collection filled with similar motifs—floral and butterfly embellishments showed up on bodysuits, sexy skirts and sheer overlay dresses. Op-printed sweaters and skirts, short furs and translucent tops with ruffled trims also took a turn on the runway. The show closed with a string of jean ensembles that contrasted the streetwise appeal of denim with the romantic feel of breezy chiffon tops.</p></div>"
3,fall,2000,f2000,alexander-mcqueen,"Björk took a fancy to, and was photographed in, a dramatic, deconstructed acid-wash denim hoop dress from this collection. Named for Eshu, the Yoruba spirit, the show paired African influences (neck rings) with Victoriana (leg-of-mutton sleeves) to dramatic effect.</p></div>"
4,fall,2000,f2000,ann-demeulemeester,"It was full speed ahead for Ann Demeulemeester, who successfully revitalized her signature designs while staying true to her well-known style. The mood was decidedly urban and gritty: There were blasted black leather coats with asymmetric skirts, stressed orange suede jackets, aged wool coats and washed black-denim ensembles. Demeulemeester's usually stark color scheme of black and white was livened up by purple military-inspired overcoats, lime-green papery tops, floor-sweeping orange skirts and a glorious sleeveless fur wrap with unfinished edges. Sequined tops, fur mufflers and yellow knit wraps gave a fun, luxurious edge to the great-looking collection.</p></div>"
5,fall,2000,f2000,anna-sui,"Bohemian deluxe is the leitmotif of Sui's work, and this season was no exception. Her runway resembled a luxurious recasting of an outdoor concert circa 1974: There were assorted floral dresses worn over colored stockings, riotous contrasts of patterns, patchwork skirts, graphic sweaters and studded jeans. Chunky stone necklaces and earrings were the perfect accessories. For evening, Sui offered embroidered georgette blouses, fringed skirts in black and pink, Lurex-striped dresses and sequined mesh tops.</p></div>"
6,fall,2000,f2000,arkadius,"The first outfit was a tiny minidress with a metallic lace top that covered the model's face. Her hand was linked to her feet with miles of gold chains—she did a good job making it to the end of the runway in all that armor. Outfit No. 2 was another miniscule dress with a giant hood decorated with porcupine quills. You get the picture. Polish-born Arkadius, in his second season, makes mad, mad clothes—the kind you come to London to see. Along with the arty insanity there were some fabulous ideas such as the foam dress, which made its wearer look as though she were an elegant mushroom; and the sweater with foam arms, which created the weird impression that the model had four arms. On a more practical note, Arkadius had one heavenly cream coat that combined wool and fur. Fur as fabric is the trendiest texture for next season. You saw it here first.</p></div>"
7,fall,2000,f2000,badgley-mischka,"Models coolly walked down a runway made out of snow at Badgley Mischka, with ice totems looming in the background. The reference was clear: Lights reflected the multicolored hues in the sculptures and on the floor as much as on the designer's dazzling clothing. This season, the collection consisted mostly of solid looks in beige, black and white—double-face cashmere was paired with sequined trousers and beaded georgette; rabbit bombers were worn with leather jeans. The ultra-glamorous eveningwear consisted of embroidered patchwork gowns and sequined sheaths in bronze, champagne, and magnesium; the bronze was so sequined it looked nearly holographic.</p></div>"
8,fall,2000,f2000,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière showed one of the most original, refined collections of the season for Balenciaga.</p><p>At a moment when artless reinterpretations of the past seem to dominate the runways, his clothes stood out for their distinct originality. To be sure, there were strong '80s references, like sharp shoulders, punk-inspired fastenings on jackets and pegged baggy trousers; but the looks were constructed with a freshness that had nothing to do with the past.</p><p>While straight, narrow black pants were worn with strict jackets and zippered shirts, ragged, tattered dresses were wrapped around the body to look nonchalantly chic. Tailored jeans were the perfect companions for batwing turtlenecks, tapestry tiger-print vests and elaborately ruffled tops. The quiet color scheme—centered on black, navy, rust and tan—added an element of sobriety and elegance to the clothes. In all, it was an extraordinary presentation—one that is sure to put Balenciaga once and for all in the center of the fashion map.</p></div>"
9,fall,2000,f2000,balmain,"At Balmain, Gilles Dufour takes the house's staid <em>Jolie Madame</em> image and filters it through the eyes of a younger generation. There is a limit to how rebellious his gilded <em>Parisienne</em> wants to get, however. <em>Grandmère's</em> draped black-jersey cocktail dress from the '40s? Punk it up a little with colored hose and spike-heeled satin ankle boots. <em>Maman's</em> sun-ray-pleated, giant-dot print '60s chiffon frock? Shrug a slim leather coat over it, and pin your hair into a messy French twist. Those dappled double-face country tweeds (nip-waist jackets and short, full skirts)? Spice them up with a graffiti print T-shirt or a skinny cashmere sweater with a saucy message emblazoned across the front.</p><p>Dufour takes an old leaf from Schiaparelli's book too, sprinkling beaded butterflies, satin M&amp;Ms or coils of ""pasta"" on fitted evening jackets, or sequin eyes, lips and even bright-colored false nails on knits. Flying with the season's ""more is more"" mantra, and leaving the editing to the editors, Dufour throws little mink matinee jackets (reinvented in cartoon colors and shrugged over cut-velvet and chiffon kilts), firework embroideries and Dickensian cutaway jackets into the frantic mix.</p></div>"
10,fall,2000,f2000,bcbg-max-azria,"According to designer Max Azria, Wim Wenders' 1987 film <em>Wings of Desire</em> was the inspiration for BCBG this season. Literal interpretations included wing motifs on the backs of heather-gray wool jackets and black T-shirts. There were also more subtle references like embroidered chiffon tops with ties that fell to the floor, mud-fur jackets, and a color palette that revolved around pewter, porcelain and sable. Colorful pieces included shiny croclike coats, glitter suede jackets, and easy plaid coats and pants. Accessories were fun and playful: faux-mink wraps, fake-fur and feather-covered bags and tall boots in distressed metallic leather.</p></div>"
11,fall,2000,f2000,bella-freud,"Bella Freud never does anything obvious—so of course her show wasn't a show at all. Instead, the designer decided to produce her own magazine, shot over the course of two days. Anita Pallenberg lent her very bohemian Chelsea flat for the shoot, which was only fitting since the whole collection was inspired by her personal style and the movie <em>Performance.</em> ""Anita's always dressed much cooler than the average rock and roller,"" said Freud. ""She has some really tacky things and some really elegant things."" Freud's collection pairs an orange velvet suit with a lilac polka-dot chiffon blouse; a purple leopard-print stretch dress with a classic coat; and a pinstripe suit with a striped English school scarf. There were perfect little black satin dresses with frills at the elbow; mini minidresses in green tiger-print chiffon and tiny skirts in fabulous English tweed. And for anyone who can't wear a 3-inch skirt, there are masses of sexy, beautifully produced knitwear.</p><p>Freud's magazine will feature all of London's coolest kids: Photographer Dan Macmillan, who will also take a turn in front of the camera, and Chanel girl Devon Aoki, Jerry Hall, Jade Parfitt and Kiara as models. Add a John Malkovich interview with Pallenberg and a contribution from artist Sarah Lucas and you have the ultimate fashion 'zine. There's only one hitch: As yet the magazine has no title.</p></div>"
12,fall,2000,f2000,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson is one designer who consistently puts fun in fashion, and she never disappoints. Manhattan's Lot 61 was converted into a nightclub for her presentation—complete with strobe lights, disco balls, blaring music and scantily clad rock chicks, motorcycle vixens and disco bunnies. Looks included plasticized cat suits, hot-pink biker ensembles, micro shorts with zipper sides, Lurex ""Ziggy Stardust"" minidresses, technicolor lizard-print hipsters and provocative eyelet leather pants. For the finale, Johnson showed mini-tutus in neon colors paired with lace tees, bras and halter tops; her wedding gown consisted of a lace puff top with diamond mini-pouf skirt.</p></div>"
13,fall,2000,f2000,bottega-veneta,"“Irresistible Bitch” was the soundtrack at Bottega Veneta, summing up the unabashedly rich, attitude-drenched spirit of the collection. Head-to-toe ski chalet outfits—picture a Bond girl on vacation in Cortina d’Ampezzo—included tan napa jackets and skirts, angora neck cuffs, knee-high boots and matching oversized bags. The ’70s-inspired feeling of irrepressible luxury also extended to several sexy silk-denim looks, as well as plush sheepskin coats, woven leather tops and shiny crocodile clutches and belts. Cashmere legwarmers, fingerless gloves and fuzzy angora short shorts completed the look.</p></div>"
14,fall,2000,f2000,boudicca,"Talented young designers Boudicca don't play by any rules except their own. Boudicca are less interested in creating clothes to wear than in ideas—but that's exactly what we come to London to see. So here are a few ideas, fresh from the Boudicca runway. A striped organza blouse that billowed out at the waist in wonderfully extravagant folds was bound in with a huge white sash. Then there was the precious cut shirt, a little puffed at the shoulder, whose sleeves split down the side of each arm and were starched to within an inch of their lives. The leather coats with weird flaps at front and neck weren't exactly deconstruction nor reconstruction. London fashion sometimes defies description, but that's the fun of it.</p></div>"
15,fall,2000,f2000,bruce,"Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, known as Bruce, proved once again that they are one of the most talented design teams in New York. This season, they presented their clothing on mannequins, with guests ambling by as if attending an art show (which very well could have been the case). Experimenting with elaborate draping and cutting techniques, the duo showed striking nubby knits, dresses decorated with scarves and gold chains, a gray leather skirt with a gathered front and a stunning leather vest with ruffled edges. Bruce's trademark has always been individuality, and it is easy to understand why—their nuanced, lovingly made clothes reflect a maturity and commitment to the integrity of their work that is seldom seen.</p></div>"
16,fall,2000,f2000,burberry-prorsum,"After a somewhat unsure beginning at Burberry, designer Roberto Menichetti has finally found his voice this season. Burberry showed 12 looks in a very strong, slick presentation at their redesigned Haymarket store—looks that said Burberry and England as much as they said modern and urban.</p><p>Menichetti's inspiration is the biker's uniform—a super-sophisticated, luxury leather and cashmere version. His message is that we should all wear very thin layers next season, each one as chic as the next, so that we can feel comfortable whether we are in an air-conditioned office or in snow boots. There were skinny leather pants in tawny brown worn with a feather-light hot-pink cashmere sweater, over which was layered a fuchsia leather jacket and a faded Burberry-check coat. And kilts in a hot-pink version of the Burberry check, wrapped and pinned in an ingenious fashion, worn with layers of fine cashmere and cool biker-inspired jackets.</p><p>The most interesting fabric development was the ultralight shearling coat—it was almost as weightless as one of his cashmere cardigans. But the crowning glory of this collection has to be the reinvention of the famous Burberry check once again. This time it was injected with a raspberry hue—the fringed scarf is a must-have.</p></div>"
17,fall,2000,f2000,calvin-klein-collection,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee Calvin Klein's main strength lies in understanding what modern women want to wear, and providing it effortlessly. Always in tune with the fashion zeitgeist, Klein turned his attention to polished silhouettes and timeless classics, redone in luxurious fabrics and deep colors. Sporty 3/4-length trousers and cashmere tweed suits shared the runway with shiny alligator coats and metallic leather skirts; floor-sweeping coats made a powerful statement, as did the sheer satin dresses in inky hues. For evening, there were satin slips in aubergine, gunmetal, powder and ruby, as well as papery graphite ensembles and viscose jersey dresses. It was a controlled, sensible collection that encapsulated the feminine, ladylike mood of the moment.</p></div>"
18,fall,2000,f2000,carolina-herrera,"It was back to basic chic for Carolina Herrera, who focused on her traditional, well-known feminine and no-nonsense silhouette. Her collection revolved around suits—formfitting stretch wool and bouclé jackets were paired with flared or lean skirts and skinny, tailored pants. Black prevailed for both day and evening. Leather skirts and coats looked striking and modern when paired with sand georgette tops, and simple crepe gowns made a splash with shocks of pink and scarlet. There was also a lush chevron-striped mink jacket, and richly embroidered dresses and separates that exuded Herrera's unmistakable touch of classic sophistication.</p></div>"
19,fall,2000,f2000,celine,"To the rousing chords of the theme music from <em>Dynasty</em>, Michael Kors took Celine on a playful romp through the high-excess '80s. It was a case of ""move-over-Nolan-Miller"" as Kors paid tribute to the campy deluxe looks once worn by Alexis Carrington and her rivals. You want luxury Dallas-style? Kors has it in spades. That black-and-gold-brocade Anna Karenina jacket? How about adding sable cuffs, collar and center banding? And why not swag golden chains as fastenings across it too. A chocolate Persian midi coat? Hem it with deep bands of cocoa mink. That black Swarovski-beaded shirt? Why not wear it with a leopard-beaded and ostrich-hemmed skirt.</p><p>Kors claimed Oscar nominee Chloë Sevigny as his primary inspiration. Although Sevigny is barely old enough to have experienced the decade firsthand, she has an insouciant way with great clothes of recent vintage—like '70s Saint Laurent pieces—that place her ahead of the fashion curve. Kors revisited the Saint Laurent ideal via off-the-shoulder satin print gypsy dresses in café au lait, paisley or leopard-print satin. Bold Chanel overscale tweed weaves also put in an appearance.</p><p>Kors is obviously targeting the glamorous young Park Avenue princesses who want to play dress-up in clothes they (just) remember their moms wearing. And who knows—Mom herself might be tempted to relive the glory moment too.</p></div>"
20,fall,2000,f2000,cerruti,"Peter Speliopoulos takes the Milanese route for Cerruti, with a collection that provides an elegant, low-key spin on the trends du jour.</p><p>Thus, neat Duchess of Windsor coats with the look of Julianne Moore's '40s costumes in <em>The End of the Affair</em> are interpreted in subtly beautiful Cerruti fabrics—like a black wool flecked with ruby glitter, or a pepper-and-salt tweed that catches a bordeaux-colored shadow in movement. The retro ladylike look follows through to the longer skirts with a graceful swing to them, and to the accessories, which included those all-too-familiar open-toed '40s sandals (shown with old-fashioned back-seamed stockings) and tiny fur tippets at the neck, already featured at Prada. Other quiet takes on trend items that Speliopoulos features include a herringbone black-and-white mink trench; chiffon bib blouses; the batwing sweater (with a deep bateau neck, and a fine gauge turtleneck worn underneath) and spiky feather fronding on café au lait and prune chiffons.</p></div>"
21,fall,2000,f2000,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan set his stage up like a sitting room. Very spare, it consisted of four chairs, a table, a flat screen television, several vases and pots, and lots and lots of white space. What has all this to do with clothes? In Chalayan's world, everything. Chalayan's models appeared dressed in seemingly simple clothes like a black coat, or tan trench, and then secreted away the household objects inside the coats or in outer pockets. Like millennial (and amazingly chic) nomads, they wandered the stage in stiff black dresses inspired by Christian Dior, ruffled skirts, shirts with strange volumes, all of it perfectly proportioned, very new and outrageously modern.</p><p>Chalayan's finale was quite astonishing. Four models clad in chic gray shift-dresses approached the set of chairs, removed the covers and literally put them on. The chair covers became perfect versions of the shifts they were already wearing. The last model stepped inside the table, lifted it up, and it transformed into a wooden skirt (the real fashion-insider will remember Chalayan's graduation show included a wooden skirt too). Finally, the chairs folded into suitcases, which were carried off the stage; the television screen disappeared; and we were left looking at an empty room. If it sounds like magic, that’s because it was.</p></div>"
22,fall,2000,f2000,chanel,"<em>On the anniversary of Karl Lagerfeld’s death, we look back at his fall 2000 collection for Chanel, presented in Paris in March 2000.</em></p><p>A year after Karl Lagerfeld’s death, we’ve gone back into the archives to retrieve the designer’s first-rate Fall 2000 collection, shown 20 years ago in Paris. The set wasn’t over-the-top elaborate, and the front row was more socialite- than celebrity-heavy (though Julianne Moore, Carole Bouquet, and Isabella Blow were in attendance), which threw the clothes into the spotlight where they belonged. Not that they were showy—they weren’t—but because they were keepers and oh-so-Chanel.</p><p>Fall 2000 was, overall, the season of the lady. One who had polish—and, likely, two homes and one eye on the fluctuating stock market. “With the Dow Jones and Nasdaq soaring and plunging like a late-sixties hemline,” wrote Sally Singer in <em>Vogue,</em> “it was perhaps inevitable that many designers would choose for fall 2000 to forgo fantasy and get back to basics—luxe basics, that is.” At Chanel that meant cardigan suits and LBDs, but also denim and active ski gear (this was before global warming made snow a real rarity).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""t22nt5""></div></div><p>Lagerfeld was, in fact, much more easygoing about the bougie vibe than many other designers were. He always delighted in subversion, whether of the house codes or the play of opposites, be that high/low or some other unexpected pairing. Look 42, a softly pleated pastel green chiffon shirt with softly inflated shoulders worn with a logo scarf and leather-topped jeans, hit just the right balance.</p><p>Upending Chanelisms was not Lagerfeld’s goal for Fall 2000, but he worked with the building blocks (as opposed to basics) with which Coco Chanel built a wardrobe for active women while adding his own touches, like whisper-light pleated skirts or midi-length ones of quilted down. (The double-C tights deserve mention too.) Asked to elaborate on his inspiration, Lagerfeld said he had been looking at and thinking about “early ready-to-wear, the end of couture, Courreges meeting Chanel.” More important was what he had been feeling: “It’s about the attitude of the early ’60s—my own memories of Jean Shrimpton and all the girls in those happy, easy days.”</p><p>For all of the joyous fashion moments Lagerfeld gave us over the course of his prolific career, we say thank you.</p></div>"
23,fall,2000,f2000,chloe,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee for her Chloé collection, Stella McCartney drew inspiration from her own childhood memories of the '70s and '80s. And since the self-proclaimed ""Rock Princess'"" impressionable years moved to a disco beat, so did this racy collection. The sexy, fun-loving Chloé gals strutted their stuff at the Opèra Garnier to the raunchiest soundtrack to rock the runways in years.</p><p>Stella set the tone for the collection with short, batwing-sleeved jersey disco dresses, trellised with Art Deco beading—all set for Studio 54. Inspired by the allure of a girl shrugging her ""boyfriend's secondhand coat"" over a skimpy dress, Stella provided wintry cover-up in off-white ""Afghan lamb"" fake fur.""Deco"" seen through '70s eyes—hink Biba, that pacy fashion and style emporium—appeared in ombré-shaded lozenge prints and in silky jersey pieces, as well as in the crisply tailored wool coats that have become a Stella signature. There was more '20s influence in the Josephine Baker-style clasps, threaded with lengths of silk ribbon cord that belted satin tops or hipsters, and in the lush beaded trim on hot chocolate, jade green and navy.</p><p>Quirky, too, were the deluxe knitting bags, transformed from the prosaic via dense beading of hand-cut feather-shaped sequins. This embroidery later appeared fringing the sleeves of mini shifts—and as entrance-making jackets and coats—like ""plastic fake fur,"" enthused Sean Lennon, who joined Stella's ever-supportive dad Paul McCartney in the audience.</p></div>"
24,fall,2000,f2000,christian-dior,"""Welcome to all our Super Fly Girls,"" read the models' upbeat cue-card backstage at the House of Dior's latest extravaganza. After the furor over his last Dior ""hobo"" couture collection, designer John Galliano crowded the mirrored runway with throwaway luxe outfits that took a leaf—make that a volume or two—from the opulent style manuals of the contemporary rap world. The fur was flying: Chunky sable and chinchilla coats, and even a sheared mink trench, were shrugged over barely there boudoir chiffon dresses (some suspended from thick gold chains). Even Galliano's thick knits were threaded with fur strips (and worn with '80s ostrich-skin skirts or skinny pants). When the fur wasn't real, it was printed--think faded animal spots on chiffon or beaded leopard pelts on stonewashed denim. <em>The Christian Dior Daily,</em> a newspaper created just for the show, was printed on chiffon, leather and even the reverse side of furs.</p><p>The mood softened with perversely ragged dresses inspired by Galliano's couture collection, and a finale of miraculously cut black or lingerie-pink lace and chiffon dresses. These, with their deconstructed corset pieces cleverly built-in, and with sun-ray-pleat insets fanning into trains, hinted at the refined Galliano magic of yesteryear.</p></div>"
25,fall,2000,f2000,christian-lacroix,"It was a playful ""Send in the Clowns"" message from Christian Lacroix, who presented his collection in the sawdust ring of a delightful early-19th-century circus. His setting, which included a towering tree of lightbulb garlands, had a certain whimsical charm, one that Lacroix apparently wanted to capture in the clothes.</p><p>True to his egalitarian philosophy, Lacroix deconstructed his various lines, mixing Jeans and Bazar pieces with his collection items. Thus, the show opened with his skinny-leg jeans—no ordinary jeans in this fashion genie's hands, of course—given the full couture works, either densely studded with gold and silver rivets or embellished with random artsy patches of bright-colored mink. With his slim pant, Lacroix showed garishly hued boxy mink jackets or tucked and pleated Victorian blouses, all with a high-rise shoulder line.</p><p>Then his clothes got really elaborate. In an eye-boggling palette of shrill neons and brights, foiled with black and white, Lacroix's multi-media pieces were a riot of appliqués, embroideries, color-block prints and patchworks. In their febrile eccentricity, they seemed to owe a debt to the performance art clothing of the late Leigh Bowery, star of the '80s London club scene. While exhilarating at times, Lacroix's ceaselessly inventive touches could prove exhausting at others; his profligate way with the ingredients made some of the dishes indigestible.</p></div>"
26,fall,2000,f2000,clements-ribeiro,"Even under the worldwide onslaught of Super-Chic Chic, Clements Ribeiro prefer to go their own, super-decorated way. Good for them—I like designers who stay true to themselves. That is not to say that Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro don't have their own, very quirky little brand of chic going. They do. It consists of soft chiffon dresses beaded with tarnished siver sequins, little sweater sets in glittery stripes or polka dots, distressed tartan skirt suits, beautifully printed silk blouses with wonderfully billowy '70s-style sleeves, and wool coats printed with giant, glittery polka dots. Their take on the suit was as original as ever—a cropped jacket with puffy sleeves and cropped trousers, or a bow-necked jacket with a slim skirt.</p><p>Clements Ribeiro's use of color is always interesting, and this time the hit combination was lemon and camel. Worn as a sharp little camel coat with lemon dress and hat, this look was the very picture of chic, London-style.</p></div>"
27,fall,2000,f2000,comme-des-garcons,"As a follow-up to a frilly feminine Spring 2000 show, Rei Kawakubo presented a collection titled Hard and Forceful for the Fall. A paean to punk, it featured tartan (of course), bondage-style straps, black leather, and studs. Sound straightforward? Think again. A plaid jacket paired with a full tulle skirt had a New Look air; the Royal Stewart plaid was twisted into cascades of flowering ruffles.</p><p>The collection was shown on models with close-cropped, bobby-pinned wings and Cubist beauty looks. It closed with a punchy graphic print, featuring lips, eyes, flowers, and razor blades drawn in red and black on a white ground.

28,fall,2000,f2000,costume-national,"Costume National is best known for its sleek, modern take on urban ready-to-wear. The label's loyal following of no-nonsense, minimal-inclined clients will have no trouble revamping their fall wardrobes with supple leather tops, slim pantsuits and satin copper blouses. To lighten the mood, they will turn to off-white suede jackets worn with leather skirts (skin on skin is an unbeatable combination), and cowl-neck sweaters. Of course, everyone needs a bit of spice once in a while. Not to worry—houndstooth-print red-and-black satin dresses, sheared fur sweaters and glittery black suits for evening should do the trick.</p></div>"
29,fall,2000,f2000,cynthia-rowley,"It was a fun, fast-paced show at Cynthia Rowley, based on the lives of young, rich and beautiful It girls. Soft, feminine prints acquired a hard edge when cut close to the body and paired with beaded mock-croc tops. Short dresses in optical prints screamed for a night of dancing, while striped leather pants and chiffon tops looked urban and easy-to-wear. A series of brocaded, glittery evening looks provided yet another set of wardrobe options for those hankering for a night out on the town.</p></div>"
30,fall,2000,f2000,daryl-k,"This season, Daryl K's recurrent themes—country-western, punk and urban hipster motifs—were fused together in a vibrant, eclectic cocktail. The show consisted of 30 carefully constructed looks that included silk-pleated bomber jackets with insets, shearling jackets and jean skirts with velvet insets. Of course, Kerrigan also featured her trademark hip-huggers, spiced up with leather piping or metallic glitter, and paired with billowy angel blouses. And, if you're in need of the perfect downtown party ensemble, look no further: Daryl K's patchwork leather dresses, tuxedo shirts and suede gathered numbers are sure to hit the spot.</p></div>"
31,fall,2000,f2000,diane-von-furstenberg,"""Feel like a woman—wear a dress"" was the inscription on the tickets attached to Diane von Furstenberg's famous wrap dresses in the early '70s. Twenty years later, the designer's philosophy of ""simple, one-step dressing"" still rings true--women need elegant outfits that work in virtually any situation, day or night. This time around, von Furstenberg presented her collection in the form of a <em>tableau vivant</em>, with models casually chatting and dancing to the music as guests ambled by. Silk jersey dresses in harlequin prints, paperweight suede numbers in brown, ivy green and pumpkin and double-faced satin sheaths in marble blue and yellow were at the heart of the collection. The silhouette was slinky, seductive and classic, with a distinctly aloof and sophisticated edge.</p></div>"
32,fall,2000,f2000,dkny,"Donna Karan's DKNY collection revolved around suits this season, featuring a structured silhouette in classic tweeds, herringbones and plaids. Belted macs, pleated skirts, cashmere turtlenecks and mohair dresses all looked grown-up and sophisticated, while sexy oxblood leather coats, sheer chiffon tops and lacquered satin shells also made a polished statement. But DKNY is all about mixing and matching—Karan also showed colorful Fair Isle cashmere and washed-wool multi-bias sweaters that were both relaxed and modern. And, naturally, there were plenty of sexy options—Karan's slim pants, short leather jackets, liquid dresses and vivid hosiery are sure to satisfy even the staunchest DKNY aficionado.</p></div>"
33,fall,2000,f2000,dolce-gabbana,"Looking for dazzle? Leave it to Dolce &amp; Gabbana to supply a jolt of show-stopping glamour. Inspired by the Middle East, the duo's collection featured everything from gold tapestry-printed dresses to silver palazzo pants to glimmering, striped Lurex T-shirts. Even their interpretation of the current suit craze was appropriately glitzy: there were purple velvet knicker-and-jacket combos and three-piece corduroy riding ensembles with rhinestone-covered berets. How to top off the look? Try a patchwork shearling coat, a colorfully decorated fur or a shiny croc jacket with leopard-print lining and matching hat. If you need still more flash, you can always go for the hoop earrings, bright tights and flower-appliquéd shoes.</p></div>"
34,fall,2000,f2000,donna-karan,"""A Woman's Voice"" was the title of Donna Karan's collection, a return to the constructed, impeccably crafted pieces that every woman needs and wants. Karan's silhouette was fitted yet easy-to-wear: Shoulders were narrow while skirts opened up to full A-lines. Black set the tone for double-face wool coats, tops and pants, but there were also some sharp tweed suits as well as occasional flashes of color: Bright red cashmere sweaters and mohair skirts, aubergine trenchcoats and violet jackets livened up the show. For evening, Karan indulged in velvet cinnamon and raspberry dresses, as well as beaded, airy sequined black and burgundy numbers that were as sexy as they were sophisticated.</p></div>"
35,fall,2000,f2000,dries-van-noten,"Beneath a floating ceiling solid with lightbulbs—4,300 in all—Dries Van Noten sent out a sweet and whimsical collection where the message was in the mix.</p><p>Van Noten worked with the season's ladylike theme but translated it through the eyes of a madcap English milady. Her charming, haphazard vision revolved around unexpected juxtapositions--a tweedy coat worn over poison-green flapper dresses (beaded with blossom-shaped sequins); a mustard funnel-neck sweater, thick enough for a British winter, with a horizontally paneled emerald velvet skirt.</p><p>Van Noten cited the influence of the Bloomsbury Group of artists and writers in twenties London, and, indeed, their off-key color sense and devil-may-care attitude to clothes saturated this artsy collection. Even when Van Noten showed an outfit as unembellished as a ribbed black polo neck with wide ""Oxford Bag"" pants, he wrapped an ivory hand-knit scarf around it—and embroidered the trailing ends with a crusting of amethyst beads. There was a '50s feel, too, in the nubbly wool coats with thick fur collars, and the buoyant gored skirts in brightly colored silk stripes or fruity velvet—a lighter reworking of Van Noten's Spanish gypsy crinolines of last season.</p></div>"
36,fall,2000,f2000,elspeth-gibson,"Naomi Campbell and Madonna have both recently been spotted on major shopping sprees at Elspeth Gibson's store on Pont Street, London. I can see why. Gibson has developed into a designer whose clothes might not be wildly innovative but are absolutely irresistible regardless. Frankly, who could say no to an aubergine-colored, paisley-print wool dress, with a bow at the neck and both wrists? Not me. I don't think I could put up much resistance to Gibson's Lurex-lace-tweed (yes, she combined all three in one fabric) skirts, or to her long tweed coats with cord pockets and detailing either. This designer wants to bring back the hat (the tweed trilby), gloves (long, tan, leather) and shoes that glitter (lilac, leather, by Jimmy Choo). Entitled ""Say Chic,"" here's a wardrobe for the cool London girl—who grew up. Oh, and the other thing that maketh woman: red lips. They'll be as important as your handbag this fall.</p></div>"
37,fall,2000,f2000,emanuel-ungaro,"With an acid-splashed black runway and Billy Idol's ""Rebel Yell"" turned up to deafening volume, Ungaro's elegant front-row ladies must have suspected that the classical couturier was having an identity crisis. Suspicions were confirmed as the first Avenue Montaigne-punk amazons pounded down the runway in rockabilly zoot jackets with second-skin red-and-black ""stonewash"" jeans, teetering on glitter-toed clear-plastic spectator heels and glowering from behind their '70s tequila-sunrise sunglasses.</p><p>With an electric palette of hot pinks, poison yellows and the season's ubiquitous purples (all combined at one point in a delirious camouflage print), Ungaro indulged in a psychedelic disco parade—complete with beaded chiffon ponchos, asymmetric handkerchief hems, bright jersey mini dresses and '70s-style rock-chick beaded pantsuits. Of course, Ungaro has many of these great references in his own archives, but the fine gold chains swagged like an admiral's decorations across a scarlet pantsuit, or forming a peek-a-boo disco top, looked like they had strayed from last season's Chloé runway.</p><p>Young-at-heart mothers hitting their mid-life crises might respond to the modern idea of deconstructing their wardrobe pieces and mixing them up again with a hip new attitude, but their fashion-forward young daughters will love the real classics--like the purple-banded black on white pinstripe pantsuit and the superb new take on Rita Hayworth's knock-'em-dead <em>Gilda</em> gown, made sexy as only Ungaro knows how in black jersey.</p></div>"
38,fall,2000,f2000,emporio-armani,"Taking his Emporio line in a more eclectic direction, Giorgio Armani ably translated both luxurious and practical looks into affordable, trend-conscious clothes. On the sumptuous side, there were rich velvet and beaded evening dresses, voluminous overcoats in pale pastels and fur-trimmed chiffon tops. But, obliging his customers' taste for easy-to-wear suits and separates, Armani also showed narrow skirts, slim trousers and an assortment of wool suits. The use of geometric patterns, floral details, beaded fringes and ethnic embroidery proved that the father of minimalism can easily maintain his signature style while infusing his designs with considerable dash.</p></div>"
39,fall,2000,f2000,eric-bergere,"""I dedicated the collection to Françoise Hardy,"" explained Eric Bergère after his quintessentially Parisian collection. ""She was the Twiggy of France#151;a writer, singer and Left Bank intellectual and an inspiration for people like Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger."" Bergère took elements of Hardy's trademark kooky '60s-style—an androgynous attitude, miniskirts worn with hip-slung belts, black leather headscarves—and morphed them with pieces drawn from the uniforms of chic European children, including pinafores, short capes, school blazer badges and the sort of stiff little A-line coats favored by the British Royal family.</p><p>The soundtrack mixed folky '60s French singers with music from <em>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</em>, and mirrored Bergère's feeling for ""a little bit of '60s and '70s, but modernized"" for his clothes, which run the gamut from elegant, to, well, kooky. Bergère cuts his stylish skinny pants just above the ankle and gives his blouses the bishop's sleeve of the season, but throws some alarming hot pants and even an '80s rah-rah skirt into the brew. A sheer chiffon blouse with a bow-tie neckline (worn with a short velvet skirt), and the low back on an otherwise cover-up velvet cocktail dress, however, hint at the stylish Saint Laurent ideal that Bergère happily continues to hold dear.</p></div>"
40,fall,2000,f2000,fendi,"This season, opulence reigned supreme on the Fendi runway. Over the past few years, Fendi has become the ultimate word in high-end luxury and this collection didn’t disappoint. Any of the optical dresses, A-line leather skirts and color-splotched furs would have been just the thing on the maiden voyage of the Concorde—of course, they all look perfectly fabulous right now. Printed chiffon dresses, patent leather jackets and tweed suits—most cinched at the waist with gaudy gold belts—added to the sumptuous mix. The all-out decadent mood was reminiscent of the eighties, several prints were inspired by the sixties and the glamorous attitude was all seventies, but the spirit of the collection was anything but retro. The irreverent mixing and matching of references, and the skillful way in which colors and fabrics were treated, was absolutely of the moment and nothing short of brilliant.</p></div>"
41,fall,2000,f2000,genny,"Josephus Thimister's graphic, fluid presentation for Genny was inspired by the Russian constructivist artists of the '20s. Centered on the idea of contrasts, Thimister alternated between rigorous tweeds, light muslin and patchworks of shimmering, ethereal fabrics. His color palette paid homage to Kandinsky, relying on hues of pale green, tangerine, magenta and peach, with occasional bursts of violet. The masterful way Thimister gathered sheer tops and layered delicate skirts evinced his couture background; the dreamy mood was offset by sharp trousers and sleek coats. Genny's collection was a tribute to the designer's ability to combine seemingly disparate elements in a sophisticated and beautiful manner.</p></div>"
42,fall,2000,f2000,gianfranco-ferre,"The extravagant craftsmanship of couture has filtered down to Gianfranco Ferré's whimsical ready-to-wear line. No less eclectic than romantic, Ferré's collection featured languid dresses, taffeta ruffles over crinolines and strict Hungarian army coats thrown over utterly feminine georgette robes. There were also long leather skirts, gray flannel trousers and the designer's signature tailored shirts. This precisely cut collection will surely keep Ferré's well-established clientele perfectly satisfied.</p></div>"
43,fall,2000,f2000,giorgio-armani,"It was a welcome treat to see Giorgio Armani do what he does best: dress sophisticated women in classic, chic clothes. The suit—Armani's forte and the season's leitmotif—played an appropriately prominent role in this collection. But forget untailored and slouchy--these suits were sharp, closely cut and sexy, in jet-black or gray. There were also cropped fur jackets with blue and lavender highlights, colorful striped tops and embroidered trousers in shades of mint green and coral. For evening, Armani indulged in a series of floor-length sophisticated black-and-white beaded gowns, which explains why he remains the darling of the international cocktail party set.</p></div>"
44,fall,2000,f2000,givenchy,"Alexander McQueen bravely set his show to the X-Ray Spec's punk ballad ""I'm a cliché?""—then set out to refute the message by appropriating styling tricks absorbed from a new school of designers. His first look—a man-size jacket in army green worn with a white shirt, narrow golden clip-on tie and a white shirt and hose—defined the new '80s proportions that are establishing themselves so forcefully this season. '80s, too, were the clever twist jersey mini dresses (think early Versace), and the gold lamé wood-grain brocades, used for sharply cut short-waisted jackets and slim-leg pants worn with sleeveless leather tops (Alexis Carrington goes clubbing). A Gothic punky attitude coursed through the show, reinforced through the somber palette of army green, black and purple.</p><p>As he reinforced with his own name-collection, McQueen is a visionary talent. So it was a pity that this production had the formulaic look of a stylist-led collection, with classic staples tricked up with styling details—like trousers bloused into ankle boots, and jackets cinched at waist or hip with invisibly fastening wide patent belts and Kraftwerk-narrow ties worn with men's shirts. Flashes of McQueen's real talents shone through in the punk-slashed tartan top over a prune patent mini, those twist dresses and a black-and-purple banded leather mini-dress, the bands fastening in back like bondage belts.</p><p>More exhilarating still was McQueen's bow—he coursed the considerable length of the runway (a beautiful curving corridor in the Musée du Cinema, currently under renovation) on a speeding scooter.</p></div>"
45,fall,2000,f2000,gucci,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year Nominee Tom Ford's collection for Gucci was sleek, sensual and filled with the edgy sex appeal that has become his trademark. The show opened with a series of sharp and shiny silk gazar dresses and coats, featuring ornately ruffled necklines. Wool and cashmere looks included belted coats with carefully defined waists and leather-trimmed tweed suits. Ford quickly moved on to fitted, in-your-face motorcycle ensembles that were thoroughly young and urban. For evening, he turned the volume way up with an assortment of dazzling gold coats, slinky dresses and beaded gowns with plunging necklines. The entire collection was carried by Ford's deft way with shapes and materials, which allowed him to effortlessly create a feeling that was modern and chic.</p></div>"
46,fall,2000,f2000,halston,"Simplicity in dressing was Halston's dictum while he was still alive. Now it seems that a less discreet philosophy has permeated practically every piece that bears his name: Gold ombré sequined suits, goatskin ball gowns and tricolor pastel tweed ensembles were a few of the looks on the runway this season. Alongside classic Halston staples like Ultrasuede raincoats and lace halter skimps, there were logo beaded dresses, cardigans and jackets. Sex appeal was a key element of the show, and a lot of the eveningwear, like the matte jersey slit dresses, fox wraps and slick columns, are sure never to go unnoticed.</p></div>"
47,fall,2000,f2000,helmut-lang,"Urban and modern are synonymous with Helmut Lang, and with good reason. This season, while most designers scamper to redefine yet another bygone era or perfectly distill the trend of the moment, Lang took time out to create sharp, clean and timeless clothes. That is not to say that there were no references involved; Balenciaga certainly was an influence for the fitted tops and jackets, bell-shaped skirts and exquisitely voluminous dresses that dominated his runway. But Lang has too fine a sense of his own aesthetic for his designs ever to appear derivative. The ease of the silhouette, and the signature color palette—shades of basic tones with occasional shocks of color—were all his own. As if to stress the validity and timelessness of his practical philosophy, Lang made sure to open the show with his most recognizable classics—super-sharp pants and suits, street-smart coats and transparent tops. The results, especially in contrast with the gratuitous ornamentation often seen elsewhere, were more gratifying than ever.</p></div>"
48,fall,2000,f2000,hermes,"At Hermès, Martin Margiela created a bridge between things ultra-luxurious and utilitarian. During his tenure, he returned again and again to the humble pea jacket. For Fall 2000, it got the “transformable” treatment; offered in camel, it featured a removable collar and leather closures.</p><p>Also multipurpose were reversible toppers that could be rolled up and carried like a blanket on a leather strap. <em>Le pique-nique, c’est chic!</em> As for the showstopping crocodile skirt lined in lambskin, it counted as the absolute ne plus ultra of understated but undeniable glamour—with, <em>Vogue</em> reported, a $31,000 price tag.</p></div>"
49,fall,2000,f2000,jean-colonna,"At a moment when it seems like everything in fashion has gone positively dotty, dainty, polished and ruffled, Jean Colonna's fast-paced, hard-edged collection offered a refreshing change of mood. In his hands, the sweet, girly chiffon dresses that have taken over the runways have now become super-sexy, vampy attention-grabbers with zippers, sequins and appliqués. Jeans with leatherlike insets had frayed edges and piping, and leopard-print tops were worn under sheer blouses. How to top off the ""can't-wait-for-midnight"" look? With massive faux furs, golden motorcycle jackets and coats, transparent shoes and graphic, <em>Blade Runner</em>-inspired make-up.</p></div>"
50,fall,2000,f2000,jean-paul-gaultier,"Jean Paul Gaultier's collection was an ode to smoky Parisian chic—although at times it felt like an epic poem since those looks just kept on coming. Gaultier created a rain-drenched sidewalk as his runway became littered with cigarette butts in true Gallic fashion. His models came out provocatively dragging on Gauloises to a soundtrack featuring the soothing words of an anti-smoking therapist.</p><p>Gaultier wanted to create real-life looks that reflected ""the chic and elegance of daily life""—for the chic Parisienne perhaps—and threw in just enough of his customary playful inventions. These included vests with collars that folded into integral jackets and opera gloves with pockets just big enough for, well, a packet of cigarettes. Gaultier has reinvented the trench coat masterfully in his couture collections, and they put in an appearance here too--black and narrow and cut to the floor or as a perfect little coat-dress.</p><p>If it wasn't the characteristic show-stopping Gaultier drama, this collection was about a quiet elegance that, like his couture collections, paid subtle homage to Saint Laurent. YSL touches included the jersey chemise--here reworked as a tunic over pinstripe pants, featherlight chiffon pleat skirts, stylish ""smokings"" and all those mannish trilby hats.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""lttd0e""></div></div><p>Gaultier, who was already an established design force the first time around, showed timely '80s touches like the stirrup pants worn with viciously high heels and the bat-wing sleeve that appeared throughout the collection—proving his talents for invention and reinvention.</p></div>"
51,fall,2000,f2000,jeremy-scott,"The avant-garde met retail-credibility tonight as Jeremy Scott proved once again that he has the ability to turn out chic, salable clothes and still maintain an independent spirit. His show opened with a series of brown pinstriped looks that were, as always, inspired by the '80s, but looked thoroughly modern; logo bags, coats and turtlenecks cheekily referenced fashion's love affair with branding.</p><p>Scott's vision of evening wear consisted of tuxedo-printed T-shirts and bathing-suit dresses. Perhaps for the first time in history, a ruffled sweatshirt was presented as part of a smoking. For an appropriately dazzling finale, Scott revived early-Hollywood diva looks—serving up negligées, robes, satin gowns and Grecian columns that offered a sexy and humorous take on America's infatuation with iconic starlets.</p></div>"
52,fall,2000,f2000,john-bartlett,"Inspired by such iconic references as the film _Grey Gardens,_The Jockey in Paris and model Lisa Fonssagrives, John Bartlett presented a vamped-up, tongue-in-cheek collection that alluded to a bygone era of whimsical glamour. Bartlett relied on classic prints such as checks, chevron stripes and houndstooth, and reworked them in all shapes and sizes—some blown up so large that they were barely recognizable. Adding to the ""erotic heiresses"" theme were sexy fuchsia and chocolate leather pieces, capes with high-ruched necks and transparent tops. A couple of figure-hugging, double-knit wool jumpsuits, perfect for après-ski in Aspen, closed the sexy presentation.</p></div>"
53,fall,2000,f2000,john-galliano,"""Welcome to our Playground."" This time at Chez Galliano, those telling models' cue-cards were scripted in bright crayola colors and stuck with children's sweeties.</p><p>Yes, Galliano decided it was time for some serious dress-up, but after his flashy Dior show earlier in the week, he wasn't thinking of entrance-making Oscar gowns. Instead, he chose to further infantalize his models (many of whom have yet to break into their twenties), by casting them as little girls let loose with their mom's clothes—and maybe their pop's and sports-mad brother's too.</p><p>With all the pressure on him to continually invent the fashion wheel, and please the big guns at LVMH, Galliano apparently decided to regress to a cozier time. To a soundtrack that included the themes from '60s British kids' TV shows, Galliano's girls (and one or two experimental little boys too), clomped down the runway in mom's far-too-big shoes (perversely made with inner pockets to ensure that they actually did fit), their faces and sometimes clothes smeared with primary paint colors. A brother's huge soccer shirt (team Galliano); dad's giant cardigan; mom's mad '70s wallpaper print frock; her prom dress (stepped into the wrong way, twisting the bodice all to the front), were all assembled with a child's delightfully untrained eye.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""3skovb""></div></div><p>Some tattered but classic Galliano treasures could be salvaged from the dress-up box, but this was less a fashion show than an indulgent but enchanted Alice-in-Wonderland adventure into the comfort zone of barely remembered childhood.</p></div>"
54,fall,2000,f2000,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald decided to end London fashion week with a very loud bang. He attracted 1500 people to the Millennium Dome to see a brashy, flashy, trashy, vampy collection of barely-there evening gowns, asymmetrical frocks and almost-invisible miniskirts. Into this outrageous mix, he threw quite a lot of crazy printed fur coats, gilded serpent trousers and psychedelic jeans. The whole bizarre experience rounded up with a performance from Gwen Stefani and her band No Doubt. She was wearing bondage trousers and one of Julien Macdonald's fabulous pink coats. Fashion rocks!</p></div>"
55,fall,2000,f2000,junya-watanabe,"<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/junya-watanabe/"">Junya Watanabe</a>’s Techno Couture collection followed on the heels of his acclaimed Function and Practicality show, which featured simulated rain that proved his transformable get-ups were, indeed waterproof. For Fall his focus shifted from water to air. Despite his play with volumes, Watanabe’s Fall collection is perhaps the most ethereal he has ever created.</p><p>“One didn’t have to be a professional seamstress to understand the hard work that had been put into creating those large forms yet keeping the texture so delicate,” says model Vicky Andrén, 16 years after wearing them on the runway. “The outfits were perhaps not what I would be wearing on a daily basis.” She remembers them “mainly because the collection quite literally ‘stood out’ in such an extraordinary way.”</p><p>At first glance, the honeycomb ruffs Junya Watanabe showed in his Fall 2000 Techno Couture collection called to mind those seen in Rembrandt portraits, but we’re guessing those starched confections couldn’t fold and be stored in an envelope, like Watanabe’s. They certainly weren’t made of a “techno” fabric like polyester chiffon, from which the designer created his up-to-date and exaggerated take on the ruff, transforming it from an accessory to a garment with an organic-meets-space-age aesthetic. The material might have been unknown in Rembrandt’s time, but its method of production—hand sewing—certainly was.</p></div>"
56,fall,2000,f2000,kenzo,"""I tried to imagine what would happen if different minorities from all over the world met across time and space,"" said Gilles Rosier about his first solo collection for Kenzo. For his fast-paced, visually arresting show, Rosier reworked classic Kenzo favorites—loose shapes, colorful prints and patterns—into urban, modern looks that pay tribute to the house's heritage while decidedly moving ahead.</p><p>Supple leather coats and skirts were given a punk touch when paired with lace-up ankle boots, patchwork plaids and batwing tops; there was also a graphic '80s influence in a series of large geometric-motif dresses. A touch of the orient became apparent through the Japanese orchid prints, slit kimono sleeves and obi sashes that were seamlessly woven in. It was a successful, eclectic collection for Rosier, who proved that he can create a modern image for Kenzo while remaining true to his mentor's roots.</p></div>"
57,fall,2000,f2000,krizia,"Midnight blue, Afghanistan blue, China blue, Prussian blue—Krizia's collection demanded one word: blue. The effect was strangely hypnotic, forcing the audience to look more closely than usual at the cut and fit of the clothes. Tailored jackets and coats sported small rounded shoulders and important collars, while simple rectangles of fabric were worn as wraparound cloaks, with two side slits as armholes. Sheer pareos and scarves were layered and used as skirts. A welcome chromatic respite came in the form of tie-dyed spirals of white on cashmere knits, but the real surprise arrived at the end of the show: the sea of azure was interrupted by a series of jeweled evening dresses in peach, orange and rust that looked absolutely dazzling.</p></div>"
58,fall,2000,f2000,lanvin,"""Pretty"" is not a word that has been flying freely at the collections this season, but it is just the effect that Cristina Ortiz achieved at Lanvin. Her light-handed collection wafted along like a breath of sweet-scented fresh air after all of this week's smoky nightclub ambience.</p><p>Ortiz softened her hard geometry of past seasons, but continued to draw on graphic Art Deco motifs that referenced the slightly theatrical clothes that made Jeanne Lanvin a fashion star in the '20s. In Ortiz's sophisticated hands, and with her intriguing color mixes, the effects were never old-fashioned.</p><p>A jigsaw patchwork of lozenge-shapes, embroidered in silk or beads, resembled the work of Jean Dunand, the great '20s decorative artist. Ortiz used the patchwork in African colors for a stiff A-line skirt, or as a giant ""kipper"" tie, knotted over a black chiffon blouse. A sweater of sheared fur was crafted in color-shaded chevrons; a chiffon skirt or blouse had a whirlpool effect of swirling panels in beige, cocoa and sky. A Barbie-pink satin blouse, worn with peach chiffon bootleg pants, was an exclamation point of color. And Ortiz introduced subtle traces of gold—as in the borders on a skinny biscuit-colored fur bomber jacket; the hip-slung belt on a chiffon dress in ice-cream tones of coffee, framboise, lemon and peach; and in the platform-heeled golden sandals, their gilded soles flashing prettily as the high-stepping mannequins stalked the runway.</p></div>"
59,fall,2000,f2000,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele aptly calls his collection ""sophisticated, eccentric, ostentatious, daring, smart, sexy and languid."" The American designer relied on his well-known brand of glamour for this collection, and it shows. Printed tweed suits looked smashing when paired with fox mufflers and scarves; so did the flirty tulle dresses with embroidered overlay that opened the show. But Steele's forte is cocktail dressing, and he knows it. His ultrasleek, shimmering, liquid black-and-gold gowns and beaded sheer numbers are designed for women who want to make a statement and aren't afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p></div>"

Don't ask.</p><p>Pretentious theory aside, Rodriguez's show was a study in controlled elegance. His graphic little shift dresses and neat coats and pantsuits had the look of Jackie Onassis' sporty-deluxe wardrobe during the Ari years.</p><p>Deft leather work is the specialty of this classical Spanish house, and Rodriguez capitalized on the superb craftsmanship with contrast-insets in a Mondrian grid on those leather shifts, and refined chevron work. Subtle touches of hidden luxury included a warm-pink satin lining on the camel jacket of a mini suit, and matte caviar sequins on a chiffon evening mini. Rodriguez kept to an appropriately Spanish palette of black, honey-tan, palomino and a dash of lingerie-pink, and focused on understated luxury.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zzxtev""></div></div><p>You win the pop quiz if you can count the number of chevron black-and-white mink coats we've seen this season, but Rodriguez's held its own.

61,fall,2000,f2000,louis-vuitton,"As decade crunching continues to move forward at breakneck speed, it is inevitable that a designer as acutely attuned to the style buzz on the streets as Marc Jacobs should pick up and run with the '80s vibe currently setting a younger generation of style-makers on fire. For luxury house Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs revisits Paris in the '80s, paying homage to the looks featured in publications like the so-hip-it-hurts style manual <em>JILL</em>, and translating them into must-have modern looks.</p><p>The early Madonna moment—beret, oversized sweater slouched off one shoulder and short, leather pencil skirt--was skewered and chic-ed up with luxury fabrics. Think of that sweater in corduroy-seamed sheared fur, the skirt in satin thick as leather.</p><p>Early Montana and Mugler signatures were evoked in details like the decorative silver-press stud fastenings on the shoulder of a satin print T-shirt, silver cube buttons as closures on man-size jackets, curving seams on footballer-shouldered jackets and zippers diagonally splicing 7/8 coats. Jacobs' twisted palette also brought the decade flooding back—endless existentialist black of course, spiked with café au lait, chocolate, peppermint and teal (dazzling for a crocodile trouser suit). His tortoise-shell, sequined mini dresses closing the whirlwind show were suspended from—or trimmed with—the fine gold chain that was also used for the adorable midget disco purse—just big enough to hold that members' pass for disco hot spot Le Palace.</p></div>"
62,fall,2000,f2000,luca-luca,"A sheared fur-enveloped Ivana Trump was prominently seated in the front row at Luca Luca, as if to sum up the spirit of the collection, which consisted mostly of flashy zebra prints, formfitting black-, orange- and white-leather ensembles, and heavily beaded eveningwear. Texture came in the form of white rabbit jackets, black pleatherette suits and a turquoise alpaca coat. For anyone in need of a little extra oomph, there were also plenty of sequined cow-print skirts and overcoats, royal-blue sequined bustiers and shantung pants.</p></div>"
63,fall,2000,f2000,luella,"""Daddy, who were The Clash"" was the jokey little title of Luella Bartley's first catwalk show. Indeed her models wouldn't know—they were dressed like the hippest teenage schoolgirls, and probably born around 1987. It was hard not to adore the clothes—or the attitude. A neat houndstooth check dress was as proper as could be until you saw the zip up the back, which opened at both ends, and up on the arms. Hot pink drainpipe jeans with the word 'darling' written in tiny crystals on the back pocket and worn with a pink blouse and perfect-black jacket showed us all how the hip crowd will wear tailoring next season. There was even a striped school blazer worn with a white shirt and skinny trousers. Luella is way ahead of the pack. She's stylishly brought back the mod teenager, added a splash of Blondie and created an ultracool image for her label.</p></div>"
64,fall,2000,f2000,maison-martin-margiela,"“La mode du XXL” remained Margiela’s fixation through Spring into Fall 2000, though the latter show was more elegant and sculptural, with beautifully shaped sleeves and silhouettes, sized 74 and 78.</p></div>"
65,fall,2000,f2000,marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs continued doing what he does best: reinterpreting classic favorites with a refined, self-effacing skill. This time around, '70s wardrobe favorites—head-to-toe looks that call to mind a sophisticated feminist art dealer with a penchant for the organic—underwent his skillful surgical treatment. Jacobs turned out a series of accurate tweed suits with leather trim, cashmere-starved schoolgirl double-faced shift dresses, and sporty jackets embellished with buttons, oddly reminiscent of a subdued, time-warped Patrick Kelly. For the final portion of the show, Jacobs departed from his easygoing motif and ventured into a series of delicate, grown-up mille-feuille organza skirts, textured silk shirts, and ultra-light faille dresses in brick, grape, salmon, and rust.</p></div>"
66,fall,2000,f2000,mark-eisen,"Eisen's clothes have always been simultaneously sensual and practical, executed in sophisticated, figure-flattering fabrics. This season, the South African-born designer showed a neat, clean collection of tan leather coats and tops, luxuriously chunky knit sweaters and light Prince of Wales suits with leather piping. For evening, gauzy chiffon looks were both sweet and sexy while a series of feathered coats and skirts were pure glamour. His presentation touched upon many of the prevailing trends of the season, translating them into fun, easy-to-wear looks.</p></div>"
67,fall,2000,f2000,martine-sitbon,"In a season that has seen battalions of smoky '80s Parisienne looks stalk the runways, Martine Sitbon, who can rightly claim this territory as her particular and rightful property, has really come into her own. Black looks opened the show like a satin high-belted jacket over a skirt formed from a patchwork of matte and shine fabrics, or a bishop-sleeve blouse with stiff culottes. Then Sitbon smiled—on stylish purple, poison yellow or mustard-gold color-ways, dazzling against the patent runway.</p><p>Sitbon's slick urban effects are counterpointed with charming artisanal detailing. This season, standouts included overscale windowpane checks created from felted wool layers; a sweater of purple mink patchwork pieces; gigantic fabric roses blooming on a purple organza skirt; a flurry of handkerchief points as a playful corsage on a close-fitting sweater; and swags of ""chic punk"" fine chains as trim. There was even a Sitbon take on ladylike '60s Chanel, with a tweedy ivory mohair coat embroidered with a plaid design of gold thread, encapsulating the particularly Gallic brand of chic with a punk attitude that she has always championed.</p></div>"
68,fall,2000,f2000,matthew-williamson,"Mathew Williamson decided he wanted the audience to concentrate on the clothes, rather than on Jade Jagger's latest look, so he banished his famous fans from the front row to the after-party. It wasn't hard to focus since Williamson opened his show with an attention-grabbing dress made of skeins of crystal worn by the giraffelike Jodie Kidd. He followed this with a show inspired by the colors and shapes of stained-glass windows, with a very modern take. Black dresses with cutout work were backed with hot pinks, limes and oranges to create a very graphic look, and were lit up at the end of the show to great effect. But Williamson's softer pieces were where he excelled: There was a wonderfully chic black silk dress with beaded lime chiffon hidden under pleats; amazingly floaty fishtailed chiffon skirts; and my personal favorite, a Day-Glo yellow chiffon evening dress, backless and pulled in at the waist with a beaded back lace sash. This has to be one of the sexiest, most magical evening dresses I have seen so far this season. And in a season of suits, a splash of romance is utterly refreshing.</p></div>"
69,fall,2000,f2000,michael-kors-collection,"Big-city glamour was the inspiration for Michael Kors' dazzlingly rich, unabashedly ladylike show, which is sure to usher in a season of polished, sophisticated dressing. Kors reinterpreted decadent deco classics—sleek, tailored coats, languid blouses and body-hugging metallic columns—in a way that brilliantly crystallized the opulence of the current fashion moment. There were also textured tweed suits, sumptuous cashmere sweaters (which are currently being treated as essential, everyday staples) and healthy doses of fur and feathers for good measure. How to accessorize the 1930s by way of 2000? With large pearls everywhere, sleek pumps, Minnie-the-Moocheresque head wraps and fedora hats and ice-cool diamond belts, of course.</p></div>"
70,fall,2000,f2000,miguel-adrover,"Miguel Adrover confirmed with his second collection that he is one of the most creative new talents on the fashion scene. The Spanish designer clearly has an outstanding ability to identify the fashion moment, detect its undercurrents and transform them according to his unique sensibility. His presentation featured everything—from reconfigured garments made out of Burberry coats, Louis Vuitton purses and vintage denim to soft, feminine blouses with gathered sleeves, and strict, deftly tailored dresses with unfinished asymmetric hems. There were also functional plaid pants, chunky knits and ornate, spider-woven beaded evening dresses. The word is out: Adrover has shown that it is possible to maintain an independent creative spirit, and simultaneously produce chic, wearable clothes.</p></div>"
71,fall,2000,f2000,missoni,"It's a good fashion moment for Missoni. Prints and sophistication--both buzzwords for Fall—are the concepts upon which this well-known Italian fashion house was founded. Missoni's ideal of visual—and visible—elegance came alive on the runway with considerable zeal. Capitalizing on the current branding craze, Missoni used a zigzag ""M"" pattern as an oversize, tongue-firmly-in-cheek logo. There was also an emphasis on eclectic mixing and matching: beaded trousers, Lurex knits, liquid satins and comfy tweeds all came together in an extravagant potpourri of texture and color. How to top off the rich look? With sheared-fur bomber jackets, gold tights and matching shoes and bags.</p></div>"
72,fall,2000,f2000,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada reworked some of the most outstanding concepts of her signature line into accessible looks for Miu Miu, her diffusion label. It was an eminently wearable, simple and refined collection, centered on sweet, girly dresses—pale-rose chiffon slips, some gathered or bunched--and the season's all-important essential—the perfect jacket. Loose coats with rounded shoulders, ample shiny skirts and fitted tweed suits successfully acknowledged the '40s-inspired elegance present in much of the Fall collections. Pleated wool skirts were worn with casual striped tees, and optical-printed skirts and tops were playfully mixed and matched. Once again, Prada proved that diffusion lines can often compete with the best of the rest.</p></div>"
73,fall,2000,f2000,moschino,"<em>In anticipation of the upcoming Costume Institute exhibition,</em> “<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/event/met-gala"">Camp: Notes on Fashion</a>,” <em>we’ve digitized collections from which pieces were selected for the show or catalog. This collection was presented in February 2000 in Milan.</em></p><p>“Witch one?” was the query scrawled across the set of this lighthearted Moschino show inspired by <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> The first model carried a house-shaped handbag, and her otherwise straightforward gray pencil skirt was appliquéd with a dog resembling Toto. Other references to the story included striped “witchy” stockings worn by models, pairs of mannequin legs sticking up from the floor, and oilcan hats à la the Tin Man. Inspired by the famous ruby slippers were sparkly shoes, capes, and dresses flashing with sequins. Western cowboy looks and flying-nun ensembles were puzzling outliers.</p><p>Unlike Franco Moschino, his successor Rossella Jardini didn’t assume the role of commentator and critic, though she preserved the brand’s humor in a rather straightforward and mostly surface way. The campiest piece in this collection, according to the Costume Institute, was perhaps also the most poignant: an iron-shaped purse that could be seen as a nod to Franco Moschino’s white button-down shirt (also included in “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-1991-ready-to-wear/moschino"">Spring 1991</a>) that featured iron “burns” and the punny legend “Too Much Irony.”</p></div>"
74,fall,2000,f2000,narciso-rodriguez,"Leave it to Narciso Rodriguez to create the perfect little dress. The Cuban-American designer's forte has always been adding a touch of edginess to simple, chic classics, and this season he proved that he is still ahead of the game in that department. Silk charmeuse formed the base of his collection--showing up on dresses and slips that were worn alone or layered, alluding to a sensual state of partial undress. Rodriguez hardened the mood with sharp, tailored leather coats and cashmere tweed dresses. There were also sleek, fitted cashmere trousers and sexy, curve-hugging T-shirts. Clever accessories completed the look: Rodriguez featured luxurious alligator bags, decadent mink booties and hefty chains worn as necklaces and bracelets.</p></div>"
75,fall,2000,f2000,nicole-miller,"Nicole Miller devotees rely on the New York designer to translate the mood of the moment into reliable, affordable pieces. But this season, money and luxury were the inspiration for her opulent series of tweed, embroidered suits and corsets, multicolored-striped sweaters and rich paisley skirts. Miller added an especially extravagant touch to the lineup with fuzzy camouflage jackets, sleek leather pants and rabbit sweaters, bags and scarves. For evening, there were a series of jeweled looks, fox stoles, angora sweaters and even some elephant-skin jackets.</p></div>"
76,fall,2000,f2000,olivier-theyskens,"In just a few years, Belgian wunderkind Olivier Theyskens has established himself as one of the most powerful creative personalities in fashion. His show opened with a series of sleek, hard-edged leather pieces that suggested the need for protection, not only from the weather, but from urban life in general—long, bulky leather coats with zippers were worn with ruched long skirts and sleek pants that flared at the bottom. Great-looking tuxedo suits with side fastenings, knit sweater dresses (sometimes with the tuft of an even longer, voluminous skirt peeking out) and a modern take on legwarmers, that reliable '80s favorite, added to the eclectic mix. Of course, there were also a few breathtaking feats of construction—massive ball skirts worn as either part of a dress, or with an equally huge coat on top. It was a visually arresting presentation that assured Theyskens a prominent spot in fashion's future.</p></div>"
77,fall,2000,f2000,oscar-de-la-renta,"It was an easy-to-wear collection for Oscar de la Renta, who managed to turn out very relaxed pieces without forgoing his traditional feeling of luxury. Cashmere ruled the runway—showing up on colorful striped skirts, sweaters and knit cardigans. Brick, burgundy and navy coats and jackets were lavishly embroidered. There were also striking black ensembles in leather, suede and taffeta—perfect for a sexy evening out on the town. Of course, de la Renta's presentation could not be complete without dazzling evening wear—feather dresses, voluminous faille ball skirts worn casually with a sweater and iridescent paillette gowns, which closed the show with a big bang.</p></div>"
78,fall,2000,f2000,pamela-dennis,"In some circles, Pamela Dennis has built a reputation as a reliable purveyor of classic yet eye-catching eveningwear. This season, black leather was crucial to her collection, showing up on slim skirts and trousers that were paired with limestone gauze shirts and beaded camisoles. Graphite lamé organza ball skirts, crinkled skirts, stretch-wool cocktail dresses and gazar asymmetrical gowns completed the show.</p></div>"
79,fall,2000,f2000,philosophy,"The models at Philosophy smiled demurely as they showed off a sweet and girly collection. Alberta Ferretti successfully translated some popular trends of the season—including pulled-together, chic, ladylike elegance—into youthful, easy-to wear looks for her loyal following of sophisticated girls. Short pleated skirts in strong colors livened up tweed suits, while brilliant patterns and bright tights brought vibrance to simple day dresses. Accessories added an important edge to the collection: There were thin double-loop belts, dyed fur mufflers, triple buckles on skirts and printed foulards. For evening, Ferretti showed a series of featherlight, sophisticated chiffon dresses in black and white.</p></div>"
80,fall,2000,f2000,prada,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee Miuccia Prada showed a strikingly beautiful collection. Sharp suits with narrow shoulders, defined waists and flowing skirts captured the spirit of the presentation, which was all about polished elegance and classic sophistication. Inspired by a '40s silhouette, Prada relied on an understated and tasteful color scheme: chocolate and gray dominated, with occasional dashes of yellow and red. For evening, Prada showed sexy velvet dresses with floral appliqués and a few silver beaded gowns that were absolute showstoppers. And, of course, you can always rely on Prada for some of the best accessories on the market: Her open-toed heels and geometric bags were an instant hit with the fashion crowd.</p></div>"
81,fall,2000,f2000,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Preen is an underground outfit that has steadily built up something of a cult following. Incredibly hip and ultra-trendy, designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi bring the London Street to the runway in a very effective manner. The red skirtsuit with a bow at the neck was the most modern take on the suit I have seen this season; a little black dress had marvelously Gothic pointy shoulders and a ton of cool attitude. Chiffons appliquéd with leather were super-sexy; a pale pink sweater, with its overly high neck and giant wool rose at the shoulder, would hit the spot whether you were at Balthazar or Meow Mix. I call it Edgy Chic.</p></div>"
82,fall,2000,f2000,ralph-lauren,"""There's a new kind of glamour that's polished, sleek and sexy,"" said Ralph Lauren about his collection of simple, elegant American classics. Suits played a key role for Lauren this season—black, fitted jackets and sharply detailed trousers and skirts were worn with casual cashmere crewnecks and ivory silk blouses. Fair Isle sweaters accompanied comfortable Donegal tweeds and steely leather pants. Striking crocodile car coats and broadtail trousers added a shot of opulence to the presentation, as did the evening dresses: There were body-conscious satin and jersey gowns, as well as Persian-motif embroidered gowns that are sure to cause a stir at any event.</p></div>"
83,fall,2000,f2000,randolph-duke,"It was a characteristically flamboyant presentation for Randolph Duke, who has never been known to shy away from sexy curves, ornate beading and overall decoration. Double-face wool knits in black, camel and grey, herringbone separates and wool suits opened the show. Evening progressed into chevron-beaded pants, sparkly tweeds with ostrich feathers and houndstooth motifs done up in plumes. To top it all off, there were chinchilla cuffs, dyed-fox shoulder slings and super-luxe sables.</p></div>"
84,fall,2000,f2000,richard-tyler,"Richard Tyler built his career on his strength as a tailor, and on the success of the high-powered, glamorous pieces he created for Hollywood stars—which explains his penchant for sharp lines and eye-catching details. Tyler showed a series of tweed coats and skirts with snakeskin belts and trim, plaid jackets and houndstooth pants, tulle tops with voluminous ballet skirts and easy-going shirtdresses. For evening, there were shiny Chinese-embroidered jacquard looks in light blue, orange and pink, as well as sexy chiffon jersey ruffle dresses.</p></div>"
85,fall,2000,f2000,robert-cary-williams,"A jeep smashing through a wall of white paper, a moving forest, wire fencing, London’s oldest railway arches: These images formed the backdrop for Robert Cary-Williams’ third show, which was ultra London, ultra avant-garde and ultra brilliant. To Cary-Williams, clothes are something to be deconstructed and then reconstructed with ingenious zips and seaming. Take his idea of a dress—a cream, devoré satin-slip dress hung by one thread off one shoulder, hung by a zip off the other and frayed at the ends, with one side trailing on the floor. Or a shirt—make it in black cotton, bind it with ties around the waist and then add intricately pleated cuffs that zip off. For coats, Cary-Williams took a tough olive cotton trench that had an asymmetric collar and one strap at the bottom that made it just off-kilter enough to be edgy. He also had a black version, minus that naughty little strap, that was unbelievably chic and wearable. So, there was only one wearable piece in the show, but Cary-Williams is still working out his style and his attitude—he has as much potential as Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan did at the beginning. We’ll wait for the cocktail dresses.</p><p>A footnote, literally: Sandra Choi, the designer at Jimmy Choo, has created some nuttily fabulous shoes for this show. They were men’s brogues in pale skin-colored leather, which had been molded in water on a foot, leaving imprints of toes in the shoes. Very original. Very odd. Very alternative-chic.</p></div>"
86,fall,2000,f2000,roland-mouret,"This boy (OK, he's 39 but looks like a kid) just gets chic-er and chic-er. Mouret's talent is to sew without seams—many of his dresses are just one piece of fabric that is held together with a single humble safety pin. As a result, his dresses have a lightness of touch that is almost unrivaled. His show, located in Borough High Street, SE1, featured a photographic studio as a set, with the models posing as though on a shoot. This gave us ample time to get a good look at sheer chiffon shirts in electric blue with giant bows, several versions of the little black dress—some floor length, some sexily backless, all very graphic and modern-looking—as well as a perfect Yves Saint Laurent-inspired trouser suit and a Poiret-esque coat. Mouret's only decoration was a giant '60s-style rose at the neck on some of the pieces that was reminiscent of the famous Chanel camellia. The ladies, and the coolsters, will be lining up.</p></div>"
87,fall,2000,f2000,ruffo-research,"Belgian design team A.F. Vandervoorst has come to define a new kind of laid-back cool. Designing their second collection for Ruffo Research, the duo turned their attention to the Harley-Davidson set. Their presentation took place in a large space decorated like a beer hall—the perfect setting for rugged motorcycle men and their babes to display a series of plush furs, tan shearling pullovers with unfinished edges and long leather coats. There were also trompe-l’oeil leather jeans and jackets, and leather trousers treated to look like corduroy. More urban were the long asymmetric skirts and cropped bomber jackets, worn with calf-high boots. In all, A.F. Vandervoorst presented a fun, witty line that underscores Ruffo Research’s growing reputation as one of the most interesting breeding grounds for highly original talent.</p></div>"
88,fall,2000,f2000,russell-sage,"Young designer Russell Sage called his show, ""So Sue Me."" His inspiration was the logo mania of the moment, and he took some famous fashion references—like the Burberry trench—and reconfigured them for the avant-garde. The Burberry check was worn as a vest with a cobalt blue, sequined, puffed-sleeve top underneath; Tommy Hilfiger's rock 'n' roll collection of last season was satirized in a rough hessian corset that read TOMMY ROCKS in red beads across the front.</p><p>Among the craziness there were some good ideas—like the faded blue mac with frayed hem and a lining that resembled gold leaf, the amazing take on Elizabethan sleeves and the way that chiffon was used as an outer layer over solids rather than as an inner layer. There was even an old Union Jack flag that had been burnt, appliquéd with gold paillettes and turned into an outrageous skirt. It's recycling for the chic set—very street, very UK.</p></div>"
89,fall,2000,f2000,saint-laurent,"With his third runway show for Yves Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz finally hit the target with a controlled collection that proved a strong modern take on the house's timeless chic. Elbaz elongated and chiseled the classic proportions of the trademark boxy jackets and pencil skirts, and showed them with black glove-leather shirts with matching narrow ties--a cool, modern spin for the classic YSL suit. With satin revers on an overscale man's Crombie coat, he also gave a contemporary twist to ""le Smoking.""</p><p>Moving away from the house's enduring '40s references, Elbaz's models wore their hair in severe French twists and stalked the runway in vicious stiletto-heeled shoes. Tabard coats and dresses, worn over skinny rib knits, and a trio of priestly black jersey robes, allowed Elbaz to express his austere side.</p><p>Leaving <em>grand soir</em> statements to the master himself and the haute couture collection he continues to design, Elbaz sent out only short, after-dark looks for his finale. Classic metallic lace looked chic again, in long-sleeved midi dresses styled with hip-slung crocodile belts and wrinkled '70s cavalier boots. Great-looking tarnished brass lamé suits with black chiffon blouses, body-skimming cocktail dresses in black slipper-satin, and entrance-making flapper dresses—solid with brilliant silver bugle beads—were followed by a final stylish take on a YSL classic—the sheer black chiffon blouse with a skirt made entirely of ostrich feathers.</p></div>"
90,fall,2000,f2000,sonia-rykiel,"Knit-maven Sonia Rykiel's influence has been felt on runways all over town this season, and in London, Milan and New York too. Think of all those skinny '70s knit sweaters, the glitter stripes and accessories, the jewel-dotted berets, those fluorescent-bright accents on black. So it was great to see La Rykiel, flame-haired grandmother to all these trends, in such glittering good form.</p><p>Rykiel delved into her archives for great '70s and '80s references that look as hip today as they ever did. The '70s looks ran the gamut from Annie Hall layers (spiced up with cone-heeled colored metallic disco shoes) to a black-jersey tabard over lipstick-red sequin leggings. Deco sunburst intarsias on plum and cyclamen knits; a chocolate-and-red overscale plaid with a Burberry feel; a striped fur <em>Flashdance</em> sweater over skintight pants; and a sheared black fur sweatshirt and mini were also upbeat takes on current fashion hits.</p><p>Even Rykiel's archaic way of presenting clothes is so out that it's in again, from the opening lineup with a row of girls (hair frizzed à la Rykiel) in different color-spectrum versions of the same wide jersey Oxford ""bag"" pants and stole, to the Old World tradition of sending out a bride. Especially when the bride is the hot young British model Liberty Ross, and her knit twinset, beret and full taffeta skirts are in tones of the season's must-have orchid purple with a playfully overscaled ruby-red mink daisy tucked at the waist.</p></div>"
91,fall,2000,f2000,thimister,"Showing in his new showroom space—an atmospheric turn-of-the-century Parisian atelier—Josephus Thimister’s collection was an exercise in subtlety. Hairstylist Odile Gilbert’s pink- and grey-powdered eighteenth-century looks—on both men and women—reflected a mood gently suggested by Thimister via Beau Brummel collars on poplin blouses, and close-to-the-body frock coats in stiff felted wools.</p><p>Confined to an exquisite palette of <em>bois de rose,</em> bone, ink, dulled silver and tobacco, Thimister made his a message of continuity, revisiting his trademark pieces. The sheath dress with a draped wrap in back, or pelican cowl in front, was reconsidered in glazed linen or ribbed platinum lamé. Thimister’s signature mohair hand-knits appeared as overscaled sweaters over side-swagged skirts, or as slim evening dresses dusted with tarnished silver sequins and ribbon thread—or even as a fragile evening stole for a shining evening sheath worn by enduringly beautiful ’60s supermodel Benedetta Barzini. Thimister’s oatmeal mohair hand-knit cardigan with platinum lamé pants was also the most contemporary take on the vintage Chanel redux that has proved a collection’s keynote—a subtle homage to another designer who believed in evolutionary fashion.</p></div>"
92,fall,2000,f2000,tommy-hilfiger,"""High-octane Ivy League"" is how Tommy Hilfiger described his coed collegiate collection, which revolved around sporty, All-American preppy looks. Houndstooth and Donegal tweed suits were worn with light turtleneck sweaters; A-line skirts were finely tailored, light and feminine. Scottish tartans in green, navy, red and white dominated the runway, showing up in the lining of classic coats, on easy-fitting pants and shirts (often made up of mismatched panels) and even on a handcrafted leather and suede skirt. Shrunken jackets in metallic leather, calf-hair dresses and suede pants covered with leather appliqués that created a tiger print added a fun and whimsical touch to the presentation.</p></div>"
93,fall,2000,f2000,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber is London's king of leather—a fabric which he contorts and reinvents with amazing style and flair. He is also a fanatically inventive tailor, whose curvaceous seaming mimics human muscle structure. Combine the two, and you have a very chic, sleek look that is now becoming a convincing signature for this designer. On the more wearable side, Webber had a slim white punched leather skirtsuit that was as edgy as it was classy; geometrically patchworked raw-shearling coats; and a sharp green leather jacket with cutout work so intricate it resembled stitching. On the creative side, Webber pulled out a stretched neon-green mesh top with mask attached; delicate green, red and white chiffon dresses and some terrifyingly tight leather frocks. Undoubtedly influenced by early Alaïa and Mugler, Webber makes the skintight vixen-look new.</p></div>"
94,fall,2000,f2000,trussardi,"It was a veritable fur-and-skin fiesta at Trussardi. Full-on luxury was the hallmark of a series of head-to-toe looks, like the sheared fur dress with python trim and matching bag and pumps that opened the show. Trussardi's logo, the sprinting greyhound, made a dashing appearance everywhere—from purse- and belt-clasps to printed cardigan twinsets and even cuff links. Evening consisted mostly of black satin dresses, also adorned with snakeskin trim. Massive fur and leather coats were accessorized with Trussardi's signature travel valises.</p></div>"
95,fall,2000,f2000,tse,"British designer Hussein Chalayan is known for his exacting attention to detail—which is present in both his signature line and his designs for TSE. This season, Chalayan turned out a series of color-blocked looks—pale gray, rose, taupe, grass and cobalt blue turned up in asymmetric jackets, ribbon-hem skirts and corduroy pants with leather trim. There were also a few sweet cotton and silk dresses with embroidered tulle overlay, and cashmere map-print sweaters. It was a tranquil, reposed collection that artfully explored the interaction between color and shape.</p></div>"
96,fall,2000,f2000,tuleh,"""Women who really care about their clothes are a fascinating bunch,"" read Tuleh's show program. Evidently, Tuleh knows exactly what their ladies want. This season, it was highly polished glamour—in the form of pert jackets, fitted fur coats and tailored pencil skirts. There was something for every occasion: from a shiny green military-inspired trench dress to plaid suits, sassy turtlenecks and sleek pants. Eveningwear was equally accomplished and varied: beaded tops, long overcoats and one-shoulder dresses. It was a classic, elegant collection that perfectly suited the venue in which it was shown: New York's tony Regency Hotel.</p></div>"
97,fall,2000,f2000,valentino,"If this is the season for ladylike clothes, this is Valentino's moment. No sly irony here, though. His real-life ladies lead a pampered limo life, apparently unchanged since the Duchess of Windsor's day. In fact, Wallis would have loved the '40s flared-skirt cocktail suits worn with fox muffs, the starburst of seams on the front of a double-face coat and the standout slim lace shirt-dress to the floor, embroidered with a trace of golden sequins and sashed in ivory chiffon.</p><p>But the fussier effects may not have received that royal seal of approval. After some recent adventures in chic simplicity, Valentino now leaves no surface unembellished. Of course, if anyone can approximate haute couture detailing in ready-to-wear, it is he. A turtleneck sweater has a twist of evening gown drapery across the bosom; a cappuccino tweedy coat is hemmed in Persian lamb and embroidered roses. And that's just for starters.</p><p>After dark, Valentino really pulls out all the stops. His more subtle looks worked bes—like a quartet of scarlet crepe cocktail dresses and the most luxurious trenchcoat in town reimagined as an opera coat, cut full to the floor in either champagne raw silk, black or Valentino red duchesse-satin. And let's hope that Va-Va's ladies own wardrobe trunks large enough to pack those giant crinoline ball gowns ruffled with organza fins—and that they find somewhere to wear them!</p></div>"
98,fall,2000,f2000,vera-wang,"Vera Wang is famous for combining couture-worthy craftsmanship with the practicality of American ready-to-wear, and her fall collection was true to her roots. It consisted of classic, elegant pieces in rich materials, cut with careful precision. Wang showed stretch tweed suits, cashmere pullovers, black crocodile coats and gabardine pleated skirts—and they all worked together. But Wang never forgets that she is most famous for her eveningwear, and she did not disappoint: There were square sequin gowns, chiffon halters, cashmere robes and a couple of show-stopping, neon-colored scarf dresses.</p></div>"
99,fall,2000,f2000,versace,
100,fall,2000,f2000,versus-versace,"Donatella Versace proved today that she is the undisputed queen of sexy glamour. The runway at Versus exploded with blocks of overlapped color, graphic prints and outsize flowers—all artfully packaged in a a sleek, controlled silhouette. Blazers were closely fitted, trousers were sharply creased and liquid dresses seemed to dance on the body. There was a variety of leather looks, ranging from a long purple coat to laminated sheepskin jackets. Of course, no Versace collection is ever complete without a touch of outrageousness: Donatella sprinkled cabochon studs and chains on short lace dresses, and turned out a series of velvet and sheared-velour evening numbers that are sure to set the night on fire.</p></div>"
101,fall,2000,f2000,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro clearly has one objective in mind when designing: to make women look as glamorous as humanly possible. This time around, his archetypal woman went out to play—mixing and matching leather motorcycle jackets in vibrant colors with easy, chunky knits, sexy crocodile belts and sleek, long slacks. Optical prints, reminiscent of '70s upholstery fabric, looked surprisingly chic in low-slung trousers and long coats; plaid fringed skirts, blush silk jackets and grape chiffon evening dresses screamed for cocktails in Aspen. Overall, it was an eclectic, artfully combined collection that successfully dared to explore a variety of influences.</p></div>"
102,fall,2000,f2000,vivienne-tam,"""I've mixed the romanticism of the Orient with sensual silhouettes to create a look that is feminine, yet hard-edged,"" said Vivienne Tam about her collection, which celebrated the Chinese New Year. Gold was the dominant color for a series of fun looks that included chrysanthemum-beaded dresses, velveteen coats with fur trims and metallic-embroidered shells. There were also shimmering optical prints, sequin starburst dresses and purple leather trousers that were thoroughly urban and modern. Tam's clean designs were enlivened with texture, color and shine to create an eclectic and thoroughly upbeat show.</p></div>"
103,fall,2000,f2000,wink,"""American Gothic"" was the theme for Wink's '80s-inspired collection, which included direct references to such pop-culture icons as The Smiths. T-shirts and leggings were inscribed with ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" in bold letters; dark, loose coats, reminiscent of Ally Sheedy in _The Breakfast Club_were worn with zip pants and flat ankle boots. There were also pleated skirts, low-waisted sweatshirt dresses and satin-cuffed jeans—ideal urban-combat gear. The show ended with a navy-washed strapless dress—the one that the bad, pretty girl, who in junior high smoked in between classes, would have worn to the prom.</p></div>"
104,fall,2000,f2000,yohji-yamamoto,"Against a hypnotic soundtrack of chants that seemed part Native-American, part Tibetan, Yohji Yamamoto sent out a bravura collection that suggested a luxurious cocooning against an arctic winter.</p><p>In the poetic Yamamoto tradition, his models looked like the brides of Mongolian or Tartar warriors. The designer's light touch also ensured that the potentially cumbersome volumes—sweeping ankle-length coats with deep-set sleeves, layered over full skirts—were controlled via airy duvet linings and decorative hand-stitched quilting.</p><p>Yamamoto used fur--real fox and faux wolf—to circle hoods and collars and to bristle from beneath the hems of padded crinoline skirts, as well as for such swaggering accessories as overscaled Cossack hats, loop stoles, gauntlets and muffs. He juxtaposed the magnificence of jacquard fabrics—their patterns suggesting antique paisley shawls—with the savage edge of animal skins, transformed into fitted sheaths. These were deftly seamed to follow the skins' natural ragged edges—a theme brilliantly developed in layered fabric pieces, with the hems cut in ragged imitation of those animal pelts. An Inuit-inspired couple and their enchanting swaddled baby closed the show, suggesting the sensuous pleasures of wrapping up against the cold.</p></div>"

2,spring,2001,s2001,alberta-ferretti,"The models at Alberta Ferretti never looked hurried or overly styled. They smiled sweetly as they walked the runway; the attitude at a Ferretti show is always as casual as the clothes.</p><p>Ferretti relied on small touches to give her looks personality: topstitching on practical navy coats, delicate embroidery on sheer day dresses and contrasting edging on the hems of her light skirts. Diagonal pleats, strategically placed darts and occasional ruffles gave the looks plenty of body-skimming movement. Ferretti also showed sleek, bright orange jackets, sexy wrap tops and a sensational draped dress with a knot in the front. For evening there were long caftan tunics with contrasting trims and subtle beading on the neckline.</p></div>"
3,spring,2001,s2001,alessandro-dell-acqua,"There was a seemingly endless procession of looks at Alessandro Dell'Acqua, including everything from mint-julep leather overcoats to translucent tops and chiffon skirts gathered at the side.</p><p>A green Lurex bikini suddenly gave way to a black blazer worn with a nude shirt and denim skirt; there were also very short shorts, straight trousers with a racing stripe down the side, sporty cardigan jackets and layered chiffon slips—arguably everything and anything a woman could need for Spring.</p><p>Nonetheless, the collection lacked direction, and after surveying so many variations of the season's main trends, it was practically impossible to discern any outstanding pieces.</p></div>"
4,spring,2001,s2001,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen's show was nothing short of monumental. The audience sat around a mirrored cube, which, when lit from inside, revealed itself to be a mental-hospital holding cell. Demented girls, wearing hospital headbands and everything from extraordinary mussel-shell skirts to impossibly chic pearl-colored cocktail dresses, slithered and strutted while uselessly attempting to fly over the cuckoo's nest.</p><p>McQueen was at his very best: There were gothic, theatrical pieces, like a dress with a miniature castle and rat posing as a shoulder pad; a top made out of a jigsaw puzzle; and a huge feathered creation with stuffed eagles suspended over the model's head, poised to attack à la Hitchcock. But amidst all the insanity, there was a cornucopia of startlingly elegant—and wearable—pantsuits, flouncy party dresses, and even a spectator pump or two.</p><p>How to top off such a climactic presentation? After everyone thought it was all over, another cube within the psychiatric ward-cum-runway opened up to reveal a portly nude woman, her face covered by a mask, breathing through a tube, surrounded by fluttering moths. It was a truly shocking and enthralling tableau: Francis Bacon via Leigh Bowery and Lucien Freud. In a word, sublime.</p></div>"
5,spring,2001,s2001,alexandre-matthieu,"Since winning the competition at the prestigious Hyères Fashion Festival in 1999, the Parisian duo of Alexandre Morgado, 25, and Matthieu Bureau, 26, have caused quite a stir with their star-burst colors, circus characters and cartoon-like appliqués. ""Our work references everything from beauty contests to Las Vegas games, from Hollywood starlets to Parisian cabaret,"" says Morgado. ""We bring new fashion elements to a vocabulary of clichés.""</p><p>Indeed they do. Alexandre Matthieu's sharp-shouldered blazers with bright stripes and asymmetric lapels, double-layered dresses with glamour-girl prints, and graphic snap-side tanks have already been picked up by forward-thinking boutiques such as Brown's, Colette, and Zao. Björk wore their now-famous black-and-pink striped dress to the Cannes Film Festival, generating instant media frenzy. The duo went on to receive an important grant from the French ministry of culture and, more recently, financial sponsorship from LVMH.</p><p>With only one formal collection under their belts, it already seems certain that there's a bright future ahead for Morgado and Bureau. ""We want to offer people a positive and optimistic view of fashion,"" they say. ""We design for women who believe in fairy tales.""</p></div>"
6,spring,2001,s2001,alice-roi,"Alice Roi, 24, is a native New Yorker with degrees from New York University and Parsons School of Design in fine arts and fashion design. Although she has designed only four collections, Roi already has been tapped to consult with Anna Molinari for her Spring 2001 collection and is set to launch a line of shoes with the British luxury line Gina. Roi's Spring collection was a rocking tribute to the '80s in all of its glorious excess: Leggings, minis, bows, batwing sleeves and white stilettos (customized with graffiti and mini padlocks) were some of the looks that Roi revisited with ironic wit and humor.</p></div>"
7,spring,2001,s2001,ann-demeulemeester,"Strong women abound for Spring 2001—but few look tougher or sexier than Demeulemeester's chic-punk chicks. Black isn't back for these ready-to-rumble types; it never went away.</p><p>Metallic band straps literally held together Demeulemeester's collection: Loose blazers were cinched with built-in belts that could be fastened tightly around the waist or left to hang around the hips. Hair pieces were draped over dresses and attached at the neck. And there were several sensational miniskirts made entirely of—what else? —metal snaps, which can be fastened as tightly or loosely as the moment calls for. Demeulemeester rounded off her collection with less aggressive but equally intriguing tie-dyed suede suits and skirts, knit sweaters with wide, loose sleeves and comfortably flared trousers. In short, the urban warrior's modern wardrobe.</p><p>Ann Demeulemeester proved that she is a designer who can constantly find new ways to reinvent herself; there is always more to her designs than meets the eye.</p></div>"
8,spring,2001,s2001,anna-sui,"There were two sides to Anna Sui's collection: a stark, punk-influenced series of slashed black jersey tops, dresses and skirts with crisscross straps, metal studs and butch-belle belts, and an array of embroidered and embellished printed chiffon and crepe ensembles. Sui would've done well to stick with the former—the moment girly prints, fringed bags and raffia anything came along, the powerful image fell apart.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the three most directional looks were worn by Belgian model Hannelore, who is fast emerging as a poster face for the new haute-punk and the more street-savvy reinterpretations of the '80s. She wore a simple white silk cowl-neck dress that looked perfectly right, a purple mesh dolman dress, and a one-shouldered black jersey number that would've worked equally well at CBGB in 1985 or at a cocktail reception in the downtown Guggenheim right now.</p></div>"
9,spring,2001,s2001,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi is known for his sharp tailoring skills and overtly sexual aesthetic, which makes this a good moment for the Italian-born, London-trained designer. His blazers were fitted, clipped at the waist and paired with straight, sleek trousers; a beige suede pantsuit had an extra flap of material that draped on one side of the jacket when it was buttoned.</p><p>But it was the dresses that stood out the most—from a black chemise with a wide, triple-buckle belt, to a scoop-necked chartreuse number with a ruched waist, and a black, one-shouldered gathered dress with a deflated balloon bottom. To indulge his racier side, Berardi also showed tan microshorts, a teensy bikini and dominatrix-inspired brassieres attached to fitted, corsetlike tops.</p></div>"
10,spring,2001,s2001,arkadius,"There was certainly no shortage of creativity at Arkadius' bizarrely bucolic London show. The Polish designer turned to his homeland for inspiration, referencing farm life with colorfully trimmed linens, flowing cottons and foulards wrapped around the head.</p><p>Intrigued by how little the style of dressing in his country has changed, Arkadius took it upon himself to suggest new possibilities. With skillful draping, ruching and cutting, he managed to turn perfectly quaint frocks into sexy, in-your-face ensembles. Arkadius' new country maiden wears slinky strapless dresses with colorful bird prints, white leather pants with gathered sides or cutouts, frayed topstitched jeans with ankle boots, and slash-cut skirts. But that's not all: there was a blood- (or faux blood-) drenched shirt, a top made out of straw and plastic birds, and a model carrying a dress suspended by two poles in front of her.</p><p>Arkadius delivered an invigorating burst of energy after the more commercial collections of New York, yet his presentation was at times repetitive and would have benefited from some careful editing.</p></div>"
11,spring,2001,s2001,as-four,"The future of fashion, at least according to creative team As Four, lies in collaboration, not the personality cult of superstar designers. For the last couple of years, Ange, Gabi, Kai and Adi—who hail from Russia, Lebanon, Germany and Israel, respectively, and prefer not to use last names—have lived as a family in a silver-painted loft in downtown New York where they create body-enveloping “embryo suits,” spiral-cut trousers and the famous metallic-print circle bags that Björk regularly carries. A year ago, As Four’s first-ever presentation consisted of battery-powered, miniature “hula dolls” that spun around on a large table wearing quirky paper outfits. For Spring 2001, the group opted for a slightly more conventional route—a runway show-turned-concert /carnival. Local bands played, acrobats twirled about, and girls strutted onstage wearing massive chiffon skirts and street-tough twisted-seam jeans. No doubt a spectacular presentation, but who will actually wear As Four’s whimsical designs? “Anybody who's true to themselves and has real style,” says Gabi confidently—“whether it’s a woman shopping at Colette in Paris or walking down the streets of Chinatown.”</p></div>"
12,spring,2001,s2001,badgley-mischka,"Technicians worked up to the very last minute on the runway at Badgley Mischka, removing their equipment just as the lights dimmed and an imperious soundtrack worthy of an overproduced Disney epic signaled Caroline Ribeiro's glittering appearance in a gold and silver embroidered shirtdress. The look was pure Badgley Mischka: sexy, slinky and attention-grabbing —as were the chiffon wrap skirts, gold beaded pants and off-the-shoulder sheer dresses that followed.</p><p>But those were just the simple day looks; the evening gowns are what flashbulb-starved Hollywood types covet most. Come Academy Award time, the predictable pack of Swarovski-mad stylists will be on the hunt for those essential body-clinging, light-reflecting, cleavage-baring, curve-hugging, thigh-revealing, heavily embroidered floor-length creations. And, at Badgley Mischka, they will find plenty to choose from.</p></div>"
13,spring,2001,s2001,balenciaga,"Every few years, a designer comes along who dramatically alters the way we see fashion, defying categorization, eschewing conventional references and barreling ahead with highly individual ideas. Nicolas Ghesquière is proving to be one of those extremely rare talents.</p><p>As always, Ghesquière's collection for Balenciaga was well edited and to the point: no need for endless repetition here. The show opened with short overall dresses with loose black blazers, no-nonsense shirts with diagonal strip insets, tiny miniskirts and slim, sleek trousers. Blousy off-the-shoulder tops and asymmetrically cut, full skirts were generously ruffled, pleated, embroidered and gathered, and twisted and manipulated every which way. Wide belts with insets, dangling cords and strands of pearls broke the silhouette and provided a corsetlike effect.</p><p>The initial feeling at Balenciaga was one of blissful, extravagant chaos—but by the end of the show it all fell quietly into place and made perfect sense.</p></div>"
14,spring,2001,s2001,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria has built a substantial business translating the trends of the moment into accessible, easy-to-wear basics—the kind of clothes aspiring L.A. actresses quickly throw on before zipping off to casting calls in their sporty borrowed convertibles.</p><p>This season, for example, there were sensible top-stitched cotton double-faced jackets and trousers (perfect for that last-minute agent meeting), pistachio silk chiffon printed dresses that are a cinch to pack, and an eye-catching rose-bloom tweed trenchcoat. For younger customers, there was also an off-white patent-leather trenchcoat, a cedar-brown patent-leather skirt, and graphic, two-tone wedge heels that should be a hit with die-hard <em>Barbarella</em> fans.</p></div>"
15,spring,2001,s2001,betsey-johnson,"Forget about carbohydrate-phobic supermodels: A wild pack of Playboy bunnies, complete with glittering furry ears, triple-F cups and skyscraper heels stormed the tents at Bryant Park today. It was all part of neon-haired and notoriously outrageous designer Betsey Johnson's playful Spring fashion romp.</p><p>Johnson's 80-plus looks were divided into 12 segments—one for each month of the year. Real-life Playboy Playmates cruised the catwalk wearing barely there georgette dresses, rhinestone-encrusted bikinis, sequined tube tops and ""bunny belle"" strapless dresses. There were also voluminous (but always short) layered tulle skirts, flamenco dresses, and festive paisley wraps in all shades of fuchsia. Johnson even showed her version of a bridal outfit—a skimpy white satin corsetlike suit accessorized with a little bow tie, a trail of scandalous bridesmaids and not much else.</p></div>"
16,spring,2001,s2001,bill-blass,"Newly-appointed Bill Blass designer Steven Slowik had a tall order to fill today: create a collection that lived up to Bill Blass' legacy of classic elegance, while attracting Park Avenue's younger generation of socialites.</p><p>Slowik took his first steps toward that lofty objective by reworking some Blass favorites: The show opened with a limpid white suit and a cotton and chiffon dress that were both very promising. There were also a couple of comfortably chic masculine suits with feminine accents like visible hints of the jackets' lining on the lapel. Having said that, Slowik still has quite a way to go. His kimono dresses were not particularly flattering; large orchid prints on a suit and dress looked overdone; and the sequined evening looks were too long and shapeless for a young girl, and too decorated for a more mature client. In short, many of the clothes were neither here nor there.</p></div>"
17,spring,2001,s2001,bottega-veneta,"London street-smarts met Milanese opulence at Bottega Veneta in what was one of the most hard-core, tough-cool collections of the week.</p><p>Any hint of dowdiness from the past is gone for good at Bottega. Designer Laura Moltedo and stylist Katie Grand moved forward at breakneck speed with black, hot pink and orange big-collared leather dresses, gathered skirts and knit-leather silver jackets. The music blared as a tribe of punky girls stormed the catwalk wearing one-shoulder tops, fluorescent green-and- orange leopard-print pantsuits, leather-paillette tank dresses with a buckle strap, and oversize sweatshirt tops.</p><p>How to accessorize the hard chic-chick look? With enormous sunglasses, woven leather pumps and graffiti-sprayed oversize clutches, of course.</p></div>"
18,spring,2001,s2001,boudicca,"The design team of Boudicca presented today one of their most wearable collections to date, centered around crisp white shirts and sharply tailored, high-waisted trousers and skirts. Naturally, there were still plenty of the duo's signature touches, like wide sashes across a strict top or tiny hidden drawstrings that cinch in unexpected places.</p><p>Boudicca's severe, almost austere collection relied on black and white as the predominant colors, and on an architectural silhouette that brought to mind the precise lines of Gianfranco Ferrés' lean, mean suits. The (even) sexier looks consisted of one-shouldered dresses with streamers, skirts with a derrière-high slit on the back and a pair of leather briefs that tied on the side. The most accessible dresses were saved for last—simple pale-rose-printed shifts with black panel insets and wide belts.</p></div>"
19,spring,2001,s2001,bruce,"Since they showed their first collection six seasons ago, Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, the team known as Bruce, have amassed a cult New York following who rely on their buttery-soft leathers and figure-hugging jeans. But with their Spring 2001 collection, Bruce proved that they have plenty more to offer—and that they are ready for the big time.</p><p>There was nothing superfluous or irrelevant about their clothes: Done almost exclusively in army green and black, they relied on precise tailoring and clarity of vision rather than facile gimmickry. There were diagonal gathered tops, asymmetric trousers with only one full-cut leg, a couple of signature Bruce leather bomber jackets and a modern military coat with a zipper on the side. The sensational draped asymmetric dress that Devon wore proved that directional design can be perfectly wearable. And, to top it all off, this season Noselli and Gutierrez added a few men's looks to the mix.</p><p>Now that several independent-minded talents like Miguel Adrover and Daryl K have been recognized by investors, it seems clear that Bruce should be next in line to receive the serious backing that they so clearly deserve.</p></div>"
20,spring,2001,s2001,burberry-prorsum,"There was not a tartan in sight at Burberry, the once-stuffy label that Roberto Menichetti has successfully revitalized over the past few seasons. The omission was a smart move, considering how much exposure the signature plaid has recently received, especially after Miguel Adrover and Russell Sage borrowed it last season for their own experiments.</p><p>Menichetti turned instead to cornflower blue, all shades of beige and muted greens. Hand-tailored leather jackets were tucked into paneled skirts with a double waistband; silk skirts and shirts looked clean and fresh without a button in sight. But some trousers, featuring a sporty stripe down the side, and a couple of casual tops bearing a ""BP"" logo (Burberry Prorsum, not British Petroleum) seemed out of place, as did the odd obi belts that cinched many looks.</p><p>In general the clothes were well-tailored and constructed, but the collection as a whole was somewhat confusing. When you consider that it was done by an Italian designer working with Eastern references for a traditional English house, it's not hard to imagine why.</p></div>"
21,spring,2001,s2001,cacharel,"The biggest venue at the Carrousel du Louvre was packed to capacity (and then some) for Cacharel's first runway show in 20 years. Now that traditional French labels are being infused with new blood left and right, the house is hoping that the newly appointed design team of Clements Ribeiro will help them move beyond Anaïs Anaïs.</p><p>Their first collection proved that there is certainly a future for the brand. Young girls should adore the pastoral red-and-blue prints, mint julep tops and leg-hugging trousers. Liberty-style florals looked modern when mixed with snazzy ginghams; boyish short-sleeved shirts provided a crisp alternative for clean-cut schoolgirls. The accessories should also be a hit with the teen set: High wedges with red checkered soles, contrasting sorbet pumps, wide floral belts and (mis)matching driving caps all looked great.</p></div>"
22,spring,2001,s2001,callaghan,"Callaghan’s show was the first ever in New York for the 35-year-old fashion house, and also served as the Stateside debut for its unofficial designer, Nicolas Ghesquière, of Balenciaga fame.</p><p>In his collection for Callaghan, Ghesquière wowed the audience with an innovative, brilliantly worked collection of gathered, tied, pleated and frayed silk dresses. The look was classical Greece by way of Princess Leia, with plenty of Bianca Jagger attitude thrown in for good measure. The references may have come from the past, but there was nothing retro about the collection.</p><p>Ghesquière’s main talent lies in his obsession with details and the precision with which he cuts every garment, creating perfect proportions. Dresses shimmied on the body with every turn; uneven, frayed hems on skirts looked violently chic and absolutely of the moment. No less impressive were a few patchwork suede looks—distressed, tattered and regal.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""komxe5""></div></div><p>As if to underscore the hipper-than-thou nature of the clothes, Ghesquière not only turned to the season’s requisite thick leather belts, but also used thin straps of colorful paillette cords. They were the perfect complement to the beaded lightning bolts that adorned several looks, a tongue-in-cheek embellishment that looked surprisingly right in this context.</p></div>"
23,spring,2001,s2001,calvin-klein-collection,"There was a sporty, ultra-casual feeling to Calvin Klein's Spring collection. Light iridescent silk V-necks, violet funnel-neck tops and microstripe jackets looked comfortable and ideal for a springtime country escapade. These looks were clearly geared toward younger customers, who will also appreciate Klein's simple graphic-block jersey dresses in contrasting colors like green tea, pale rose and cobalt, as well as his metalized leather ensembles, and a superfine suede dress with a matching, low-slung belt, which looked hip and sophisticated.</p><p>Klein's uncomplicated mood extended to evening, which consisted of delicate camisoles in silk tulle, glimmering satin and glacé jersey with vivid optical color panels.</p><p>Those who truly appreciate timeless, effortless dressing will find a consistent, wearable wardrobe at Calvin Klein, without having to bend backward in order to accommodate the trends of the nanosecond.</p></div>"
24,spring,2001,s2001,carolina-herrera,"It was a lighter, breezier and younger-than-usual collection for Carolina Herrera, who stayed true to her love for polished, delicate clothes but managed to infuse her looks with a lively and vibrant spirit.</p><p>For Herrera, Spring is all about showing off bronzed legs and nipped waists. Her flip skirts are sassy and full of movement, chopped right at the knee, in coral and tobacco geometric prints; dresses are cinched with thin leather belts or disco-inspired gold chain link. Sensible summer alternatives include one-step-dressing shirtdresses and rompers, slightly bloused and always belted. For more adventurous types, there are teeny shorts, off-the-shoulder suede blouses and even a skimpy sunflower leather strapless dress.</p><p>Evening consisted of long skirts and gowns with embroidered cuffs, waistbands and collars, as well as generously cut pleated trousers. But it was the day looks, simply styled and perfect for a confident woman, that worked best.</p></div>"
25,spring,2001,s2001,celine,"After his relaxed collection of classic American sportswear in New York, Michael Kors hit the nail on the head once again at Celine.</p><p>Kors' collection was inspired by visions of desert life, with rich safari and unstructured military themes. Vintage denim bombers and pale jeans, distressed leather trousers and officers' coats, suede sarongs and linen Sahara coats will be a welcome change for the ladies who donned last season's <em>Dynasty</em>-inspired collection. Naturally, Kors still provided the luxurious, highly refined basics his customers swear by: There was a sensational gold-leaf cashmere turtleneck, a sinful crocodile battle number and a divine bronzed wool military jacket. Kors also indulged in cashmere sweatpants and shirts which hadn't been done with such ease since Norma Kamali. Tortoise-print bikinis and safari dresses were also lighthearted and fun.</p><p>Kors' collection proved that you don't have to stage a revolution to make a point. His clothes spoke of a quiet, sophisticated luxury that is perfectly in tune with the moment.</p></div>"
26,spring,2001,s2001,cerruti,"Designer Peter Speliopoulos is on a mission to modernize Cerruti without sacrificing any of the brand's old-world sophistication—and this collection proves that he is up to the task.</p><p>While most designers have turned to eye-popping cocktail dressing for inspiration, Speliopoulos focused on simple yet impeccable basics like belted jacket dresses, sharply tailored pantsuits and masculine shirts. More feminine alternatives retained a classic spirit of polished chic: pale tangerine suede dresses looked sharp, as did military-inspired jackets with epaulettes. There was also a more playful series of looks featuring a trompe l'oeil black net overlay print.</p><p>For evening, Speliopoulos showed overlays (the real thing this time) over simple short dresses, as well as several beautifully worked skirts with straw floral insets—perfect for ladies with an arts-and-crafts penchant.</p></div>"
27,spring,2001,s2001,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan's shows are always an intellectual tour de force; this is certainly not a designer who strives to define the season's hemline or dictate what the new black is.</p><p>As usual, there were no obvious references in the show, which was held in an old studio where Alfred Hitchcock used to film. An orchestra played live as Chalayan showed a short film featuring computer-animated models whose dresses mysteriously shattered; real models followed, wearing spare topstitched suits that exposed a tailor's patterns, unfettered shifts with scribbles all around and sublimely pleated, voluminous skirts. A series of denim looks appeared clean and sober, as did an army-green miniskirt paired with a tab-collar jacket. Unexpected bursts of color included a coral pleated skirt and a sublime red print that showed up on several dresses.</p><p>Chalayan's dramatic finale tied up the masterful presentation, alluding to a theme that is often a leitmotif to his work: the impermanence of clothing. Six girls wafted onstage, three of them holding up tiny mallets, with which they proceeded to break to pieces their companions' paste dresses.</p></div>"
28,spring,2001,s2001,chloe,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year 2000 Stella McCartney certainly did not disappoint her legions of fabulous young fans who rely on Chloé for the season’s hot new trends. But this season, in addition to delivering sexy new T-shirts and plunging bathing suits (with playful pineapple motifs), McCartney explored grown-up territory. Perhaps drawing inspiration from Schiaparelli’s inventive chic, McCartney worked graphic horse prints (borrowed from Stubbs and Géricault) into loosely structured diagonal-seam dresses and beautiful jackets with a softly draped triangle shoulder. Skirts were long and relaxed, perfect when paired with lightweight, flouncy off-the shoulder tops. Wide-brim hats and dainty pillboxes with a tulle overlay gave the look a touch of ’30s sophistication. More casual pieces included sexy jeans with zipper pockets and metallic horses galloping along the backside, and a T-shirt with strategically placed banana appliqués in the front and the words “Keep your bananas off my melons” in the back.</p><p>This was a very strong collection for McCartney, and one that confirms her considerable talent and potential as a major designer.</p></div>"
29,spring,2001,s2001,christian-dior,"Highbrow eyebrows were raised from the very beginning of John Galliano’s outrageous presentation for Dior, as a sexy blaring soundtrack introduced a cavalcade of tough babes in patchwork wrapped skirts, sequined, pinned and frayed jackets, rough leather belts, vice squad-defiant heels and pop-colored fishnet stockings.</p><p>Classic Galliano motifs—newspaper-print tops, recycled and reconfigured jeans, hard-core leather straps and zippered motorcycle jackets—were thrown together with new creations like a bag that evoked a classic ’50s car (complete with door-handle clasp), sporty blousons with racing stripes, a bright yellow life-vest jacket and ruffled, hooded windbreakers. A contest of camouflage, leopard- and leather-trimmed bikinis segued into an array of ravaged prom queens who had clearly had too many drinks (not to mention a pill or two or three) the night before. But even the vampiest gals need a touch of class, so Galliano signed several looks (including lace-front dresses that surreptitiously morphed into trousers) with Dior mementos from the past: Miss Dior, Dior, J'Adore and Diorissimo.</p><p>Destruction, reconstruction, punk, recycling, tiaras, sex, patchwork, saddles, logos, commerce, camouflage, street, diffusion, vintage cars…only Galliano could pull it off.</p></div>"
30,spring,2001,s2001,christian-lacroix,"It's a very good moment for Christian Lacroix, now that graphic colors, feminine dressing and '80s references are a constant on the catwalks. The designer seized the moment and delivered one of his strongest, most consistent collections in seasons.</p><p>Lacroix played up his masterful use of color with sexy patchwork strapless numbers and ""painting-print"" dresses with beaded insets, dangling chains and straps, and embroidered patches. Punky layered chiffons and muslins, ruffled, feathered and pleated, proved that Lacroix can move way beyond his signature pouf (he very cleverly avoided them altogether). For those who can't live without basic black, there were tight trousers with corkscrew tunics, deconstructed coat-dresses, and a sensational gold-chain embroidered black jacket that Malgosia wore. Lacroix also provided some of the best belts of the season: thick, eye-popping works of art with leather insets, chunky hardware and grommets.</p></div>"
31,spring,2001,s2001,clements-ribeiro,"If anyone had any doubts that the design team of Inacio Ribeiro and Suzanne Clements could move beyond dainty cashmere sweaters, this collection ought to dispel them. The couple's Spring show could be best described as sweet and vicious, pairing feminine, delicate looks with hard-edged, punk-inspired ensembles.</p><p>Draping and gathering, a key element this season, showed up on floral-printed dolman-sleeved tops and billowy, mercilessly short dresses. Blazers were sharply nipped and strong-shouldered, worn with black, unforgiving fitted trousers, eyelet-studded belts and vertiginous heels. Formerly innocent gingham prints were also given a makeover: a translucent, one-shoulder checker dress looked dangerously sexy. Even more overtly brazen looks included a rugby shirt with a black bikini bottom and several mesh tops that left practically nothing to the imagination.</p><p>The collection was certainly a daring one for Clements Ribeiro, and in less capable hands it may have veered toward the vulgar. As it turned out, it was a success.</p></div>"
32,spring,2001,s2001,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo’s work in the early aughts is marked by its graphic impact, and her Spring 2001 collection is a case in point. Titled Optical Shock, it mixed camouflage with dizzying Op Art patterns and florals, and see-through jeans with fantastical millinery made with materials like plastic bags, bubble wrap, tinfoil, and caution tape. The designer seemed to be cultivating a sense of conscious chaos throughout.</p><p>While walking a narrow runway in a cramped space, models with scotch-taped faces were set on a near collision course with the audience. Despite the general cacophony, Kawakubo seemed less concerned with arousing anarchy than with waking us all up. We were left with a sense that the center <em>will</em> hold, secured by clear tape.</p></div>"
33,spring,2001,s2001,costume-national,"Looking for a dainty, girly, embroidered little spring frock for that garden party with the in-laws next May? Forget about it: You won't come even close to finding something like that at Costume National.</p><p>Designer Ennio Capasa went for his usual lean, mean and sleek silhouette. Masculine tuxedos were the inspiration for sexy pantsuits with wide cummerbunds, many with the jacket tucked inside the pants, some with glittering barely-there pinstripes. The black-and-white procession of bustiers, blazers and pegged trousers was only momentarily interrupted by several chocolate- brown suedes and leathers, as well as some violet-blue satins.</p><p>The look at Costume National was certainly consistent, but at some point everything tended to blur together; one would've liked to see more ideas at play.</p></div>"
34,spring,2001,s2001,cynthia-rowley,"Birds in cages hung in a long line above the runway at Cynthia Rowley as tribute to its birds and bees theme. The show was, however, as much about sex as <em>Happy Days</em> or <em>Grease</em>. What the audience saw instead was a study in 1950s American sportswear looks, silhouettes and personas.</p><p>For good girls there were a variety of full-skirted dresses nipped at the waist in both eyelet and honeycomb knit, tops with dainty details like smocking, ""bird watching"" dresses (some made from a bird print fabric) and boxy granny-style outerwear. Bad girls could take their pick of bomber jackets, hand-painted leather separates and a few scruffy boys also dressed by Rowley. The most successful bad-girl pieces were dolman-sleeved tops and dresses that fell off the shoulder.</p><p>The show was punctuated throughout with shots of neon: from the models' eye shadow to shoes with neon straps or heels and soles by Zeitgeist for Rowley. It closed with an anomalous series of dresses, many made of fluorescent string.</p></div>"
35,spring,2001,s2001,d-g,"Gold-covered couches, bottles of champagne and vodka, a row of disco balls, and a heart-shaped neon ""Love"" sign set the tone for D&amp;G's no-holds-barred joyride through a good-time girl's eclectic wardrobe.</p><p>To the tune of Madonna's hit single ""Music"", a procession of skintight nylon jersey strapless dresses, cropped motorcycle jackets and massive feather chubbies emerged. This collection was about fun, sex and money, and D&amp;G girls had no qualms about flaunting their riches. Glittery embroidery spelled out ""Diva,"" ""Expensive Doll"" and ""Because I'm Worth It"" on tops; dollar bills showed up on bikinis and sweeping chiffon dresses. Gold ruched skirts, leopard-print everything, and gigantic, colorful bows on evening dresses, tops and a miniskirt the size of a wide belt drove the point home.</p></div>"
36,spring,2001,s2001,daryl-k,"For years, Daryl K has been a cult favorite of downtown New Yorkers, who rely on her slim-fitting hiphuggers and comfy hooded sweatshirts as a sort of urban uniform. This season, Kerrigan's first with the newly formed conglomerate Pegasus Group, could mark her arrival as a fashion heavy hitter.</p><p>Kerrigan has always had a talent for mixing and matching street trends, and on this occasion she was at her best. Next Spring, young, trendy things will revel in her gold Lurex disco sweater dresses, so-sweet-yet-so-naughty sleeveless jersey tops, and sinfully scant running-shorts-inspired minis worn with hard-core mesh ankle booties. Other reworked '80s looks include a terry strapless dress, gold-chain-strap draped neck wrap tops, and gold mesh blousons accessorized with wide, low-slung leather belts.</p><p>Proving that she can creatively reinvent otherwise obvious references, Kerrigan showed a couple of brilliant canvas puff—not pouf—dresses with pleated tops and bunched skirts that owed more to Balenciaga than Lacroix. And, of course, there were also the trousers, the item that every (size 2) girl won't be able to live without: Daryl K's painted-on spinal pleat bootleg jeans in black, copper, and white canvas.</p></div>"
37,spring,2001,s2001,diane-von-furstenberg,"Thirty years after their launch, Diane von Furstenberg's vibrant, slinky numbers still look great at both the office and the disco. Today, Von Furstenberg's dresses are a hit with her devoted, old-school customers as well as with a new generation of girls who are discovering the allure of dressing like a woman.</p><p>Von Furstenberg's show, titled ""Hotel Life,"" featured plenty of her trusty wraps, in prints ranging from Playboy bunnies to airplanes (after two full seasons of logomania, the ""DVF"" logo print was less successful). For those days when silk jersey feels like a bit much, there was also a denim wrap, as well as pretty camisoles with ruffle detailing, no-nonsense cotton culottes and engine-red fitted trousers. In short, it was a collection full of breezy, easy-to-wear basics for a sexy, colorful spring.</p></div>"
38,spring,2001,s2001,dkny,"Donna Karan presented her secondary line at the Dia Center for the Arts, ushering groups of guests into the gallery space where models took to the catwalk every half-hour or so in what amounted to a revolving party.</p><p>Men's suiting was an important influence, as Karan showed oversize pinstripe blazers, stark masculine chemises, a billowy tan trench, and basic suits livened up with matte copper paillette tops.</p><p>A disheveled tulle skirt was paired with a strapless leather bustier—an unavoidable nod to the '80s. Young girls will love the shimmering hot pants and powder-blue beaded minidresses; the older crowd will stick with true-and-tried basics. Most of Karan's looks featured wide leather belts worn at the hip—a look that is already emerging as one of the key trends for the season.</p></div>"
39,spring,2001,s2001,dolce-gabbana,"With a backdrop of dainty, blossoming trees, strewn roses, lace curtains and a spanking-white little Topolino car, glitzy glamour met power-dressing at Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p><p>Smart, fitted black suits brought to mind <em>Roman Holiday</em> chic when worn with impenetrable sunglasses. Strap-back bustiers, ""Addicted to Love"" body-hugging jersey dresses and sexy pencil skirts looked sharp and severe, as did the sheer black shirts. But those who rely on Dolce &amp; Gabbana for over-the-top glitter and shine will not be disappointed—there were plenty of beaded, ravaged jeans held together with safety pins, bold-colored leather motorcycle jackets, sequin-drenched shirts and colorfully printed, voluminous skirts. Die-hard fans who remember the designers' long-time relationship with the Material Girl will definitely want to collect the new series of kitschy, heavily beaded Madonna T-shirts.</p></div>"
40,spring,2001,s2001,donna-karan,"Donna Karan reworked familiar inspirations this season—Indochine glamour and Asian weaves with the steamy seduction of New York—to create a mix of tailored, constructed jackets and suits and featherweight layered chiffon dresses.</p><p>Her show opened with a series of caviar pinstriped pencil skirts, tailored jackets and cocoon coats perfect for Karan's working woman, who is always on the hunt for pared-down yet luxurious staples. Jersey tie-front dresses, layered over champagne slips, revealed a more playful side to her collection; the same can be said for her liquid satin looks, intended for after-five cocktails.</p><p>Karan's finale was the most eye-catching part of the show: tangerine, lilac and peach beaded gowns escalated into burnt sienna pleated numbers and finally climaxed with the stunning strapless flame orange organza dress with which Shalom Harlow closed the show.</p></div>"
41,spring,2001,s2001,elspeth-gibson,"""Come to the Cabaret, my friend"" was the title for Elspeth Gibson's show, a ""fusion of ultimate glamour fringed with masculine overtones,"" according to the program. Gibson set out on a quest to reclaim the spiky femininity of divas like Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford and Jerry Hall, but unfortunately did not have much luck with her endeavor.</p><p>Gibson is known for her subtle, delicate use of decoration, and she was clearly out of her element with the plunging necklines, paillette-covered pirate shirts and microscopic miniskirts that she showed. An embroidered bikini, a pleated miniskirt worn with a beaded jacket and a glittering tuxedo complete with top hat added to the confusion.</p><p>On the upside, some pieces, like the simple geometric-print dresses and optical halter tops and sweaters, will be a worthwhile addition to any closet. But as a whole, the sexy, edgy mood that Gibson tried to achieve simply was not there.</p></div>"
42,spring,2001,s2001,emilio-pucci,"Having been recently acquired by LVMH, we can expect Pucci to develop a higher profile in the near future. The opening of a new flagship store in Milan is a clear indication that the once-ubiquitous label is poised for a revival.</p><p>Fans of Pucci's signature arabesques won't be disappointed—there were plenty of optical swirls in shades of bright lime, gray, and coral. More subtle interpretations included black-and-white damask silk looks textured with tone-on-tone prints. Shapes were for the most part reminiscent of the '60s—there were collarless coats with cropped sleeves, flashy miniskirts and skimpy shorts.</p><p>Still, it's unclear which direction the house will take in the future; the collection certainly upheld the spirit of Pucci, but there weren't any dramatic innovations.</p></div>"
43,spring,2001,s2001,emporio-armani,"There were no surprises at Emporio Armani today—feminine shapes, muted grays, khakis and blues and a very flirty attitude ruled the runway. The pantsuit was a key look, particularly single-breasted, narrow jackets and wide, low-slung trousers that ended just above the ankle with an uneven hem. Feather-light day dresses, worn with sun hats, scarf-blouses with knee-length skirts, and double-layered slips are perfect summer garden-party attire.</p><p>Armani kept the mood simple for evening, sprinkling strapless, one-shouldered or spaghetti-strap dresses with silver beads. Three gelatto-colored miniskirts with matching transparent shirts closed the show.</p></div>"
44,spring,2001,s2001,eric-bergere,"""From Bahia to St. Louis"" was the inspiration for Eric Bergère's midnight blue, rust, khaki and white collection that spanned a considerable range of influences and moods.</p><p>The general look was clearly inspired by the '80s: Lacquered linen pants, miniskirts and trenches had the appearance of leather; T-shirt dresses were dressed up with one-shouldered grommets and leather appliqués. A desert motif ensued, featuring cotton toile tunics, blousons and vests. For evening there were billowing harem pants, jersey tops with gold paillettes and muslin floor-length robes.</p><p>Bergère clearly has a talent for creating sexy, wearable clothes, yet the collection felt uneven at times, as if unsure of which direction to fully explore.</p></div>"
45,spring,2001,s2001,fendi,"Gone are the days when punk was synonymous with grungy streets and economic hardship—Karl Lagerfeld showed that metal spikes, black lipstick and hard-core leathers are perfectly proper sartorial alternatives nowadays.</p><p>Fendi women will replace fall's candy-colored furs with black zip-up biker jackets, aggressively ruched one-shoulder tops and draped, shiny dresses in body-hugging jerseys. The look is strong and powerful—leather minidresses slashed way above the knee, gathered billowy tops and voluminous, asymmetrical skirts. Dangerous-looking accessories include gold weightlifter belts, thick neck cuffs, spiked shoulder straps from which to hang a gilded purse, and stilettos dazzling with gold chain link.</p><p>Now that Lagerfeld has delivered a luxurious, highly stylized interpretation of haute punk, it's official that this will be a key style next spring.</p></div>"
46,spring,2001,s2001,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré took his architectural, highly stylized vision of fashion to Africa this season while staying true to the couture-like attention to detail, craftsmanship and fabrics that characterize his work.</p><p>Traditional tribal garments became the starting point for flights of fancy that included python-strip skirts, straw corset-dresses, shantung skirts sculpted into liquorice cones and a stunning micro dress made exclusively of red coral beads. For the less adventurous there were oversized white masculine shirts deconstructed into sexy chemises, floor-length gowns with a slight train and tailored suits with balloon sleeves.</p><p>Clearly, these are not the most practical of clothes. But if you're looking for an intricately constructed, show-stopping dress that will not likely be forgotten, Ferré could be the perfect choice.</p></div>"
47,spring,2001,s2001,giorgio-armani,"With a major retrospective of his work this fall and the opening of his massive new Milan store tonight, there was certainly no shortage of megawatt celebrities at Armani's presentation today. Sarah Ferguson, Phil Collins, Sophia Loren and Robert De Niro all stopped by to pay tribute to one of the most important designers of the past 30 years.</p><p>Armani's women—all brunettes this time around—had a coquettish, gamine charm to them, wearing masculine pinstriped trousers with suspenders, relaxed jackets and sleeveless silk T-shirts. Ultra-light lace dresses were adorned with faint, leafy patterns on a sheer background; honey leather jackets, cropped and unlined, gave the look a stronger edge. Eveningwear revolved around backless, beaded and knotted tops, paired with shimmering, crystal-embroidered pants or short, frilly skirts.</p></div>"
48,spring,2001,s2001,givenchy,"Alexander McQueen is going through a particularly good moment: After hosting an exquisite couture party for Givenchy last summer and delivering a breathtaking show for his signature line in London two weeks ago, he presented today a tempered, well-thought-out collection for Givenchy ready-to-wear.</p><p>Teddy boys, rockabilly and David Bowie were all sources of inspiration for McQueen. Skirts with massive confections of pleats, ruffles and crinolines were worn with massive corset-belts, sharp jackets and crisp short-sleeved shirts—perfect for a Sunday sundae at the fashion wonderland drive-in. There were also long, mannish pinstriped overcoats, sheer shirts with gathered panel fronts and several lingerie-inspired looks. Dazzling apple-green and red- checkered coats, spectator pumps and pegged houndstooth trousers were visually arresting, but more traditional Givenchy customers will go for the chocolate suede bombers, fitted pencil skirts and tortoiseshell-print dresses.</p></div>"
49,spring,2001,s2001,gucci,"Sex is in the air for spring 2001, and Tom Ford has always known how to work the sleek, lean look better than anyone else. But for all the raciness of his collection, it seems that this time around Gucci is undergoing somewhat of an identity crisis.</p><p>Black-and-white dominatrix-inspired looks opened the show, featuring corseted waists, rigid bustiers, and stiletto-heel shoe-boots. Massive purple satin suits alternated with safari jackets and extra-wide cargo pants; a wet T-shirt contest of manipulated, skimpy tank tops gave way to military-inspired jackets and trousers. There was also an immense dolman top, a short cape and a bat-sleeved, rubberized trenchcoat.</p><p>With fashion’s decade-jumping game moving at breakneck speed, Alaïa, Saint Laurent, Mugler, Gaultier and even Dolce &amp; Gabbana are all viable references. But are we prepared for a deflated pouf skirt with a huge cargo pocket? Cross-your-heart brassiere tops? What worked best at Gucci were the clothes that didn’t make an effort, like the straight satin trousers, ribbed tops and short, pleated dresses.</p></div>"
50,spring,2001,s2001,halston,"Craig Natiello is in the difficult position of designing for a house that bears another's name—especially since the name is that of an unparalleled icon of American design, Roy Halston Frowick. In this collection, Natiello worked with classic Halston fabrics and colors, including Ultrasuede, cashmere, beaded chiffons and Halston's signature red. But beaded warmup suits and disco music were unable to recall the glory of the Halston/Studio 54 era. Although much of the collection felt like Halston-lite, an ivory Ultrasuede shirtdress and a red cashmere scarf top paired with a red skirt struck the right balance between old and new.</p></div>"
51,spring,2001,s2001,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang's show began innocently enough, his trademark sleek trousers, body-conscious tops and functional overcoats redone for Spring in nubby silk-knit burlap. The looks were pure Helmut: functional, urban and modern. But then, gradually, a wave of sexual innuendo began to escalate. A tape-like strap was strategically placed on a semitransparent top; a bikini bottom was paired with a deep-plunging tank. Finally, a procession of crisscrossed, bondage-inspired dresses and tops whizzed through the audience. Lang, the designer who pioneered androgynous, uniform dressing, had designed a brilliant collection that could go from a Tribeca loft cocktail party to an alleyway midnight rendezvous west of Times Square.</p><p>Many of Lang's I-didn't-mean-to-turn-you-on minidresses referenced Azzedine Alaïa, whose influence can be seen just about everywhere these days. But, as always, Lang made the look his own. Slim trousers featured circular cutouts on the side; leather coats and dresses were perversely punched with holes, giving them an intimidating, gothic feel. Not quite ready to walk into the office wearing full-on dominatrix garb? Not to worry—you'll still find plenty of Lang's reliable basics to choose from.</p></div>"
52,spring,2001,s2001,hermes,"Sportswear has always been the core of clothing collections at Hermès, which was responsible, among other pieces, for the zippered leather golf jacket worn by the stylish Duke of Windsor. For Spring, Martin Margiela showed aviator and nautical looks that owed a small debt to the duke’s natty ways. The designer also introduced the trikini, a transformable three-part garment suitable for the beach and the street. On the runway, it was paired with pants.</p><p>Covered-up describes most of Margiela’s work for Hermès, but this collection had several skin-baring moments. Two models topped their tomboy trousers with striped lengths of silk hung around the neck, crossed in front over each breast, and tied at the back.</p></div>"
53,spring,2001,s2001,imitation-of-christ,"Designers Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave of Imitation of Christ claim to have a bilious distaste for organized fashion, but, for a couple of newcomers, they certainly seem tuned in to how the system works. In just one season, the duo has managed to garner an unprecedented amount of interest—thanks in part, no doubt, to high-profile celebrity friends like Chloë Sevigny and Natasha Lyonne. But Imitation of Christ also knows that in fashion performance is often as important as the clothes themselves.</p><p>For their first show, Subkoff and Damhave took over an East Village funeral parlor—complete with casket—and sent down the makeshift runway 51 dramatically clad mourners. To the plaintive tune of The Smiths’ “Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me,” a brokenhearted wife, orphaned children, assorted relatives, military heroes, and a mistress or two paid their respects wearing extraordinarily ruffled and pleated dresses, tattered uniforms and revamped thrift-store suits.</p><p>Subkoff and Damhave understand that true originality is found in unexpected places. By recycling, customizing and updating discarded clothing, the pair makes what is old new again—and the results are fresher than the self-conscious retro looks established designers often propose after cannibalizing fashion archives in search of inspiration.</p></div>"
54,spring,2001,s2001,jean-paul-gaultier,"Skulls, bats and infernal flames on Jean Paul Gaultier's invitation hinted at what was to come at his show: hordes of rough and tough Hell's Angels, biker chicks and <em>Mad Max</em> warriors. The stage was set with a dirt field in lieu of a runway and gigantic speakers blaring hard rock as a procession of gum-chewing, beer-guzzling babes in combat boots, fringed tops and airbrushed, slashed dresses appeared. Pieces of leather motorcycle jackets and pants—an arm here, half a trouser there—were tied over bunched and gathered skirts. The look was relentlessly hard—so much that at times the styling overpowered the clothes. Nonetheless, under all the madness there were plenty of wearable clothes, like a gorgeous pleated lavender skirt, colorfully printed shirts, leather miniskirts and layered tanks.</p><p>Gaultier's collection delivered two key trends for spring: short, playful yet hard-edged dresses and skirts, and aggressive biker-inspired leathers.</p></div>"
55,spring,2001,s2001,jeremy-scott,"Thank God for Jeremy Scott, a designer who knows that fashion is, first and foremost, about having fun. Paris' Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie was transformed into a gigantic suburban mall complete with winding staircase and multihued fountains—the perfect setting for the final collection of the season.</p><p>Scott showed sharp little suits, day dresses and shorts in a black-and-white print which, upon closer inspection, proved to be tiny sketches of his past designs. Yellow, purple and pale blue combos followed, as well as simple jersey dresses with a (paste) jewelry motif. The look was high glamour by way of the Sears catalog—and those familiar with Scott's work will understand that this is quite a compliment. For the grand finale Scott staged a ravishing old-school beauty pageant that was part Barbie, My Little Pony and Miss Colombia. His contestants, ravishing in Nagel makeup and curly manes, wore beaded pastel sea-shell bathing suits as Scott read out their measurements over Phil Collins' <em>Against All Odds</em> soundtrack. Who could ask for anything more?</p></div>"
56,spring,2001,s2001,jil-sander,"There was great expectation surrounding the Jil Sander show, considering that it was the first Sander collection since the German designer parted ways with the Prada Group, which owns the label.</p><p>The creative team who took over the brand clearly sought to adhere to Sander's essential dictums of clean shapes and simple design. The silhouette was definitely Sander—belted trenches, essential white shirts and unfettered shirtdresses looked perfectly proper, as did the classic light turtlenecks, now with a more ample armhole, and wearable pantsuits. Less accomplished were the high-waist trousers and skirts, which seemed cumbersome at times, especially with jackets tucked inside.</p><p>The collection's overcast, gray color scheme did not help matters. What was missing most was Sander's inimitable lightness of touch, which simply cannot be duplicated, no matter how vast the archives she left behind may be.</p></div>"
57,spring,2001,s2001,john-bartlett,"A wall of nearly naked, whitewashed men served as the backdrop for John Bartlett's runway show, which updated last season's leitmotif of ladylike dressing with a freer, less rigid approach. Kimono shapes have always been important to Bartlett, and in this case they showed up on silk jersey and cotton crepe sleeveless tops, sexy chiffon dresses and even on a ""reverse"" iron-gray suede dress that Alek Wek wore. There were also several well-cut trousers and a couple of perfect white shirts, as well as a striking wool smoking and a sleeveless, asymmetric talcum-colored leather shift.</p><p>The liner notes for Bartlett's show explained that rope was his inspiration this season—""erotic, sacred, tightening the knot that frees our duality."" Indeed, many looks were accessorized with cords, ranging from a military-inspired sash on Shalom, to a golden knot peeking out from under Angela Lindvall's black jacket. But, ultimately, it was unclear what exactly Bartlett sought to convey—the clothes were cleverly styled, but lacked a powerful message.</p></div>"
58,spring,2001,s2001,john-galliano,"Just when you thought no one could pull the fashion crowd’s leg, along comes John Galliano to stir up a storm. His presentation took place in the same venue as Dior, and <em>CD</em> logos shone bright as puzzled editors took their places. The lights dimmed, and the same aggressive and raunchy soundtrack from Dior introduced…several of the exact same Dior looks. As the music appropriately segued to Britney Spears’ “Oops!…I did It Again,” Galliano’s signature collection followed—not that it was much different from the one he showed two days ago for Dior.</p><p>Like a child playing in an insane asylum turned atelier, Galliano sent out girls in reconfigured, violated dresses with cartoony oversize zippers and giant snaps; his controversial ladies sans domicile fixe were also there, as well as new belles with massive feathered hats and tattered umbrellas. Dior’s beauty queens in bathing suits were replaced by their punk cousins, with slogans like “We live a class war” and “I wanna see some men” stamped on a derrière or two.</p><p>Some might say that Galliano’s prank collection was a bit too much—but, one could argue, it was too much of a good thing.</p></div>"
59,spring,2001,s2001,kenzo,"Gilles Rosier's collection for Kenzo was based on a play between lightness and geometry. Fluid chiffon dresses were dip-dyed and layered, chiffon ones smocked and ruffled, while harder chocolate leather skirts were embellished with graphic circular orange insets. Rosier also delivered several unpretentious, girly white dresses, trousers and wrap tops that will be perfect for a day at the beach: Throw them over one of his siren-inspired bathing suits.</p><p>Rosier is still on his way to modernizing Kenzo's considerable legacy of mixing and matching diverse cultural references. There were plenty of good pieces in the collection, but many of them got lost in a sea of repetition. The show would've gained strength if it had been edited down to the essential looks.</p></div>"
60,spring,2001,s2001,lanvin,"Lanvin designer Cristina Ortiz reworked the season's loose, sexy silhouette in a simple palette of white, tan, black, pink and red. Billowy short dresses, paillette-trimmed off-the-shoulder blouson tops and tab-collar shirts with keyhole cutouts played up the current cocktail-dressing motif. Beaded bell tops were paired with fitted knee-length skirts, and simple pantsuits were worn with masculine shirts.</p><p>Ortiz's designs were in tune with the fashion moment, but parts of her collection seemed overly derivative. The studded skirts and dresses with a woman's face on them brought to mind Chloé's embroidered looks; the diamente plunging bodysuits and the edging on white trousers were at times reminiscent of Loewe. Ortiz's collection was well cut, but the house of Lanvin has yet to develop a strong personal identity under her creative direction.</p></div>"
61,spring,2001,s2001,lawrence-steele,"It was a very focused collection for Lawrence Steele—so focused, in fact, that it was limited to only three colors.</p><p>Appropriating key elements of black-tie dress-up, Steele sent out a procession of demimondaines clad in black tuxedo-inspired pantsuits with white lining; white shirts and cheeky bow ties; white satin halter-top dresses suspended from a black tie; and white pencil skirts with simple black turtlenecks.</p><p>To break the bichromatic spell, Steele turned to Ferrari-red patent-leather coats, sequined ties and piping on immaculate coats, as well as marabou-sleeved evening dresses and a show-stealing feather coat. The shoes? Black Manolo Blahnik stilettos with a crimson sole, of course.</p></div>"
62,spring,2001,s2001,lizzy-disney,"British designer Lizzy Disney graduated in 1995 from Central Saint Martins College with a degree in fashion design and marketing. After working in New York, she returned to London where she launched her hugely successful accessories collection—called Lizzy Disney—from which her clothing line grew. With their soft draping and poise, Disney's designs, such as her off-the-shoulder lilac dress and her final number, a dramatic black dress with a fall-way sleeve, belie their complex execution.</p></div>"
63,spring,2001,s2001,loewe,"Quiet, understated luxury is Narciso Rodriguez's forte, so women who are not interested in fickle clothes that come and go every few months will feel at home with Loewe this season.</p><p>The twisted shapes that have dominated other collections were nowhere to be found here; instead, Rodriguez opted for clean-shaped blazers, shirt dresses and leather skirts with gently gathered waistbands. Suede T-shirts, kimonos and camisoles felt as light as the ecru linen wrap tops and jersey dresses; wide leather belts and hard silver cases with red or black enamel stripes gave the looks an edgier feeling.</p><p>For evening, Rodriguez kept it simple with beaded geometric dresses in bone, black and red. Aside from a couple of long, shimmering skirts, the look was short, uncomplicated and sexy.</p></div>"
64,spring,2001,s2001,louis-vuitton,"Never mind that Marc Jacobs designs four full collections a year in addition to his recently launched secondary line. With Louis Vuitton, he proved once again that he has plenty of talent to spare, and no signs of slowing down. Normally, one can be happy if a designer proposes one solid trend per season. But that would never satisfy Jacobs; instead, he whipped up and reworked several of the season's recurring motifs in completely novel ways. Uniforms, a clear influence on the Spring collections, were referenced through khaki and olive-green military blousons with epaulettes, snap-side skirts, policeman hats, an ""SS Vuitton"" naval cap and a genial camouflage rose print. Pining for fluorescent colors rather that six months in the army? Jacobs took the day-glo trend from street to chic with impeccable hot pink and neon green V-neck sweaters. Fifties met '80s punk with pleated, low-slung skirts with folded waistbands and clear plastic bands to pinch the silhouette.</p><p>Accessories? Hardly two pairs of shoes were the same: There were fluoro pumps, casual flats and sexy kitten heels to choose from. And just when you thought you couldn't stand another logo, Jacobs found the perfect compromise between art and commerce: Stephen Sprouse graffiti-painted ""Louis Vuitton"" on the house's brand-new totes.</p></div>"
65,spring,2001,s2001,luella,"Ex-British <em>Vogue</em> writer Luella Bartley has become the darling of London's new generation of ""It"" girls, so it's no surprise she snapped up models Kate Moss, Malgosia, and Frankie and Missy Rayder for her runway ode to the '80s.</p><p>Backed by an upbeat Go-Go's soundtrack, Luella offered graffiti-printed denim suits, skirts and bathing suits; and leather sleeveless tops and tube dresses trimmed with fluorescent stretch knit bands. There were also strong-shouldered motorcycle jackets, glittering pantsuits and a white tuxedo with white lapels. A seemingly innocent print revealed itself to be, upon closer inspection, a skull with the number ""87"" inscribed on its bony forehead. Liquid Sky-inspired streaks of neon over the eyes finished off the look.</p><p>It's clear that the '80s are a major influence this season, and Luella certainly capitalized on the trend. But, while her show was poppy, well-styled and undoubtedly fun, it was also too literal. Claude Montana, an obvious source of inspiration, should have been Luella's guest of honor.</p></div>"
66,spring,2001,s2001,maison-martin-margiela,"Margiela once turned socks into a sweater and gloves into a purse. For Spring ’01, he went with gloves again, this time turning them into a witty vest that might just have inspired <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-week-review/12034897/jacquemus-fall-2015-rtw/"">Simon Porte Jacquemus’s Fall ’15 show</a>. Notable, too, were the man-tailored pieces presented by models moving around a petal-strewn floor at the Louvre.</p></div>"
67,spring,2001,s2001,marc-jacobs,"It was a treat to see Marc Jacobs having a blast with his signature line, which cheekily referenced his early so-hip-it-hurts Danceteria days.</p><p>To a blaring soundtrack, a gaggle of giddy, '80s-inspired homecoming queens strutted their stuff: ruched jersey drawstring tops with punky poplin skirts, wide belts with studs and pastel appliqués, twill baggy shorts, and mile-high mesh stilettos. One-shoulder striped tees in fuchsia and black, which could have been worn by Pat Benatar circa '83, looked fresh once again; leather bustiers and jackets with bright piping and pastel shell-shaped appliqués were campy, lighthearted and fun.</p><p>Then again, if you already lived firsthand through the stylistic excesses of the early to mid-'80s, you may not be ready for a full-blown Fiorucci revival. Relax, you need not hunt for your collection of neon bows and gummy bracelets. Look past the Valley Girl styling and you'll discover plenty of wearable, grown-up pieces in Jacobs' collection, like sharply cut cotton trousers, double-layered skirts and a beautiful canary-yellow silk paper taffeta dress. A flocked-tulle confabulation could be worn with equal ease by a daring prom queen or a fashion-savvy girl-about-town.</p></div>"
68,spring,2001,s2001,marjan-pejoski,"Marjan Pejoski's game-inspired presentation left no doubt that unbridled creativity is alive and well in London. A group of children cleverly disguised as a tulle chess set opened the show, their costumes blurring as they spun about madly on a checkerboard floor.</p><p>A set of Vegas ladies of leisure followed, appropriately clad in draped jersey dresses with rhinestone accents and bejeweled cartoon characters that were simultaneously endearing and wickedly lascivious (Minnie and Mickey were far too close for comfort on a billowing top, and Felix the Cat seemed too at ease on a tiny bikini). Several net dresses that left nothing to the imagination and a strategically placed bunny-ear top were also part of the madness. The tamer pieces of a highly original collection were denim skirts and jeans with playing-card stitching on the back pockets, slinky pegged trousers, and a baseball jacket with gold sleeves and a plunging neckline.</p></div>"
69,spring,2001,s2001,markus-lupfer,"Marcus Lupfer's spunky Spring collection was all '50s rockabilly by way of the '80s. His street-tough vixens wore everything from a sensational one-strapped leather minidress with a ruched circular side seam to knit leather vests and strip-cut skirts. Plaid blazers gathered in back and tied in front with an internal leather cord looked tough and fabulous with slightly pegged trousers. Bouncy, '50s-inspired skirts to the knee, flirty dresses with draped backs and a red plaid shift with a tulle overlay provided a softer counterpoint.</p><p>For many, London fashion week is the place to discover fresh new talent. This collection, which successfully balances edgy creativity with plenty of precision and restraint, puts Lupfer in a good position to gain the recognition he deserves.</p></div>"
70,spring,2001,s2001,marni,"Marni's well-turned-out girly looks provided a welcome respite from the '80s-inspired fashions that have dominated the season so far. From the clean-cut topstitched overcoats to the breezy shirts and comfortable country skirts, designer Consuelo Castiglione delivered wearable, perfectly chic clothes.</p><p>Seersucker stripes, delicate embroidery and optical prints were all mixed and matched to great advantage; '50s-style skirts, full and layered, looked new with graphically colored two-tone spectator pumps. Boot-cut pants, a black ruched short jacket and an asymmetrical handkerchief top gave the collection a modern edge. For evening there was a striking boat-neck sequined top, pleated wrap skirts and a couple of light sheared furs.</p></div>"
71,spring,2001,s2001,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon worked plenty of ideas into her presentation, all alluding to a tough, modern woman. A black coat with pen-scratch print opened the show, followed by spray-painted dresses, leather jackets with side-zips, and a tuxedo coat and pants with a simple black shirt. A gleaming red leather coat introduced rosy overlay printed dresses, many with iridescent prints and full layered skirts. A procession of rhinestone-accented black dresses and one-shouldered, deconstructed, manipulated mini evening pieces closed the show.</p><p>Sitbon certainly created some good looks, but the collection as a whole proved to be long and repetitive, and would've benefited considerably from strict editing.</p></div>"
72,spring,2001,s2001,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson called his collection ""Candy Girls,"" and indeed it seemed like his models dressed up while in the throes of a delightfully giddy sugar rush. A pastel cotton stripy dress with a boa of ribbons twirling around it was just the beginning—not a single dull look followed.</p><p>Williamson divided his show by groups: Pink, blue and yellow shirts with beaded skirts; turquoise, olive and fuchsia cowl-neck dresses; and a series of aqua-and-navy camouflage camisoles that were more op-art than combat all looked fun and lively. Accessories included thick utility belts, some with a shoulder strap (perfect for lip gloss and cigarettes in place of live ammunition), and contrasting stockings in fluorescent colors that drove the girly message home.</p><p>The spirit of careless frivolity continued onto the evening pieces, which included everything from a tiny olive miniskirt worn with a military jacket and a ruby medal to flamenco-inspired ruffle dresses. And what better shoes to finish the look than Manolo Blahnik two-tone spikes in rainbow colors?</p></div>"
73,spring,2001,s2001,michael-kors-collection,"Kudos to Michael Kors, who presented a strong, easy-to-wear collection that reconfirmed his status as a modern master of practical American sportswear.</p><p>Fashion icons Lauren Hutton, Ali MacGraw and Martha Graham were important references for Kors, their relaxed style reinterpreted in earthy jersey ballet dresses, inviting cashmere hand-knit sweaters and a sensational muslin beaded embroidered skirt. True to his love for ultra-luxurious materials, Kors also showed a divine barley suede off-the-shoulder shift, several light shearling jackets, and a mink-backed suede serape to ward off chilly April breezes. The obligatory beige trench came in double-faced cotton, washed and oversized—creating a loose, comfortable silhouette that was anchored down with low-slung leather belts.</p><p>In contrast to last season's somewhat uptight evening looks, Kors closed his Spring show with a couple of absolutely brilliant—and perfectly simple—black stretch jersey gowns that brought to mind the best of the Halston era.</p></div>"
74,spring,2001,s2001,miguel-adrover,"Spanish designer Miguel Adrover’s Spring 2001 collection proved that he is one of the most creative and insightful talents in his field. An impeccable navy suit and cream blouse with matching navy trim set the tone for the show, providing the perfect prelude to a series of polished looks. Featuring comfortable blazers with straight-legged trousers, masculine shirts and casual polos, Adrover brought to mind a Pimm’s-and-lemonade-sipping debutante enjoying the good life in Bermuda. But his archetypal woman has many faces: Interspersed among his parade of proper uptown ladies were ghetto-fabulous home girls with bandannas and cutoff shirts, Army cadets in strict olive-green uniforms and streetwise chicks in distressed jeans. Shockingly, they all blended in seamlessly, forming a chic procession of mix-and-match style tribes.</p><p>The key to Adrover’s success lies in his ability to appropriate diverse cultural elements to create something utterly new. While most native New Yorkers develop early on a talent for deciphering stereotypes and social codes, Adrover knows that, sometimes, it is the foreigners who ultimately get it right.</p></div>"
75,spring,2001,s2001,missoni,"It was a rich woman's world at Missoni—sensuous fabrics, graphic prints piled atop each other, huge M-shaped bangles dangling on wrists and retro movie-star-inspired shades.</p><p>Missoni's ""Modern Eccentric"" wore liquid, fluid crepe, satin and jersey dresses with stiff, wide cummerbunds and double-buckle belts; for evening, beaded pants were as tight as leggings; a Lurex-knit, off-the-shoulder silver top with large ruffles lent a bit of necessary lightness to the often overwhelming looks. For hot summer days there were large tote bags, beach towels, plunging swimsuits and even robes, all decorated with signature Missoni prints. If anyone wants to flaunt a rich, overtly decadent lifestyle to the max, this is the place to turn to.</p></div>"
76,spring,2001,s2001,miu-miu,"The '50s-by-way-of-the-'80s spirit that Miuccia Prada referenced in her signature line also turned up at Miu Miu, here with a young, utilitarian spin.</p><p>The collection opened with short skirts that were dwarfed by oversize drop-shoulder jackets cinched at the waist with wide elastic belts; there were large exterior pockets on cropped tops, skirts and jackets. Striped mohair sweaters looked smart with a pleated full skirt to the knee; pointy librarian glasses accentuated the '50s collegiate look. Lighter pieces included a semi-sheer white camisole with spaghetti straps, an Empire-waist gray shift, and several printed and pleated baby-doll dresses.</p><p>The accessories also picked up on the themes seen at Prada. Geometric color-block pumps conveyed a girly and playful spirit, while the wide-strapped bags brought to mind the need for urban, no-nonsense essentials.</p></div>"
77,spring,2001,s2001,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez's appeal lies in the restraint of his designs and in the luxurious, quiet materials he employs, and his Spring collection of well-cut, understated everyday basics was no exception. A sleeveless washed suede dress, for example, looked as if it could be worn straight out of bed; cotton poplin jackets with wide sleeves over shorts looked casual and relaxed; airy, masculine white shirts looked great with pleated trousers or a silver beaded skirt for extra lift. Other standouts included a coral silk crepe dress with a partial gather at the waistline, a double-face khaki silk trench, and a white leather and sequin off-the-shoulder top.</p><p>Although the collection was perfectly chic and wearable, one can't help but wish that Rodriguez would take a leap and use his considerable talent to experiment with more adventurous ideas.</p></div>"
78,spring,2001,s2001,nicole-miller,"Cyndi Lauper's front-row presence at Nicole Miller's presentation was a harbinger of the '80s-inspired collection that followed. Wearing glitter socks with strappy metallic sandals, the models walked the runway in a dazzling array of iridescent Lurex pieces, gold denim and sequined prints. There were also matte jersey blouson and wrap dresses and, of course, a variety of prints, a Miller specialty.</p><p>Gold chains with large hanging pendants, made by Erickson Beamon for Nicole Miller, were creatively worn as necklaces, belts and even dress straps. Leather hip belts, also gold, were equally effective. ""Roller-girl glam rock—but modern"" are the words Coleman (Miller's music man) used to describe the show's sound, and they work just as well to characterize Miller's collection.</p></div>"
79,spring,2001,s2001,olivier-theyskens,"Belgians might not be familiar with the Morton Salt Girl, but they know very well the iconic yellow cire raincoat that inspired this collection. Olivier Theyskens came up with the idea of translating it into leather and from there he became swept up in a maritime theme that extended even to the set: models walked on mussel shells in shoes covered in black sand. Belgian shrimp farmers, safety boats, and life preservers were all worked into this collection, which the designer describes as all “an ode to the Belgian seaside.”</p><p>Clicking through the looks, what jumps out is how Theyskens, who was known for his dark Romanticism, applied athletic and utilitarian touches throughout his ship-shape line-up.</p></div>"
80,spring,2001,s2001,oscar-de-la-renta,"Oscar de la Renta never strays far from his signature brand of elegance, but this time around his collection felt lighter and breezier than usual. His well-established clientele will certainly go for classic favorites like the playful silk crystal pleated skirts to the knee, worn with preppy navy cashmere sweaters. Or the day dress—a summer essential—which came in a variety of styles including a chartreuse linen shift, plenty of sexy jacquard silk halters and the all-important little black number.</p><p>But for many, evening is what de la Renta does best, and they will not be disappointed. Alek Wek wore a sleeveless, white silk embroidered dress that made the audience draw breath; Caroline Ribeiro closed the show with an imposing navy-blue ruche organza gown. One caveat: de la Renta also showed skimpy bandeau tops paired with short ballooned skirts, leaving everyone in the audience wondering, Are we really ready for a full-blown pouf revival?</p></div>"
81,spring,2001,s2001,pamela-dennis,"Pegasus, the newly formed American fashion conglomerate, gave wings to Pamela Dennis' Spring 2001collection today. A darling of red-carpet regulars, Dennis showed evening wear that was one part Jean Harlow, one part <em>Ziegfield Follies</em> girl. Models strutted down the runway wearing shimmering satin gowns in colors that varied from warm gold to cool-as-ice platinum and white.</p><p>Dennis' fluid, fishtailed bias-cut dresses—accessorized with diamond broaches and jewelry from Harry Winston—recalled sophisticated '30s Hollywood glamour. In contrast, a gold metal-mesh string bikini was all 2001 in its barely-there-ness. One-shouldered dresses, halter necks and bandeaus emphasized low, low backs, and Dennis' ideal little black dress was matched perfectly with a satchel from her just-launched bag collection.</p></div>"
82,spring,2001,s2001,prada,"With her Spring presentation, Miuccia Prada left behind dainty, rarefied romanticism—and not a moment too soon. In one of her most hard-edged, sexy collections in years, Prada captured the '50s-by-way-of-the-'80s look that showed up on catwalks in New York and London, yet made it distinctly her own.</p><p>The silhouette was pinched, manipulated and focused on voluminous black and gray pleated skirts, some featuring low-slung, studded waistbands. Tops were close to the body, often cropped or cinched at the waist with ribbed cummerbunds. Bursts of color livened up the mood: Yellow pencil skirts with red polos, green blazers with blue turtlenecks, and empire-waist shift dresses all had a slightly askew schoolmarm charm .</p><p>At Prada, accessories are always as important as the clothes. The new graphic, brightly colored cone-heel pumps, some with fluorescent dabs of fuchsia and green, will surely be a hit with those who want to dip their toes in the '80s without going all the way.</p></div>"
83,spring,2001,s2001,ralph-lauren,"""Spectator at its most modern"" is how Ralph Lauren defined Spring 2001. Lauren's collection built upon the polished, well-heeled aesthetic that dominated the New York runways last season, but his new interpretation is graphic and geometric.</p><p>Black-and-white and brown-and-white served as the leitmotif for mod shift leather dresses, blazers with generous trimmed lapels and pockets and sexy two-tone jeans. The season's essential crepe de chine skirt—pleated, to the knee, and paired with a casual cashmere and silk tank—was a laid-back alternative to a sinful white crocodile minisuit. Chevron skirts, pinstriped jackets and a glen-plaid pantsuit were all worn with the same strings of pearls that were a Fall favorite.</p><p>The evening looks were also ladylike and controlled—Lauren gave lace camisoles and georgette pants lift with a touch of beading, and closed his presentation with three impressive floor-length striped gowns.</p></div>"
84,spring,2001,s2001,randolph-duke,"At Randolph Duke, the models paused behind a scrim before taking their turn on a white runway sprinkled with tiny silver sequins. Marilyn Monroe seemed to be the inspiration for a white pleated Lurex velvet number and a series of beaded nude illusion gowns, whereas Duke's full-skirted pleated dance dresses and the black selenium-beaded chiffon gowns recalled Jean Dessés' '50s fashions and '70s Halston, respectively.</p><p>The enthusiastic audience, dotted with West Coast stylists, exploded into applause at the sight of a crystal-beaded illusion dress worn by Ling. Come Oscar time, it is certain that many of these dresses will make the transition from the catwalk to the red carpet.</p></div>"
85,spring,2001,s2001,richard-tyler,"Richard Tyler showed his couture collection on a handful of models, and on mannequins assembled throughout his spacious downtown townhouse. It was a smart move on Tyler's part—editors were able to walk around at their own pace, touching the fabrics and examining the precise craftsmanship and attention to details upon which his reputation is built.</p><p>There was plenty of va-va-voom Hollywood glamour on display: silver beaded jersey dresses with necklines down to there and slits up to here, a translucent red chiffon gown sensually pleated and gathered at the bust and a black silk chiffon jersey column hanging seductively from one shoulder. But, unlike other evening wear designers, Tyler doesn't work solely with the Academy Awards paparazzi in mind. Many of his best pieces were cool and understated, like his ice-green leather suit, geometric printed trench and dress, and hand-stitched blazers.</p></div>"
86,spring,2001,s2001,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret's very grown-up, sophisticated and theatrical collection provided an alternative to the many bubblegum-inspired looks that have shown up this season. Marc Almond sang live, cabaret-style, as Mouret's evening ladies filed out of a hall of mirrors wearing masterfully draped, pleated gowns—this is, after all, a designer who is able to create traffic-stopping dresses out of a piece of fabric and a clothespin.</p><p>Mouret's collection spoke of the haughty glamour of decades past, but avoided the usual trappings. Instead of madly splashing sequins about, he carefully applied them to tears on flowing dresses and pants. A perfectly plain black one-shoulder silk cape dress relied on nothing more than precision of cut to create a stunning effect; a classic liquid white column came equipped with a large black wrap around the neck held in place by a jeweled pin. While many designers strive desperately to invent eye-catching looks that last barely a season, Mouret continues to refine his personal vision of polished femininity.</p></div>"
87,spring,2001,s2001,ruffo-research,"Sophia Kokosalaki reworked some of the themes she had explored in London with her signature line, this time around focusing exclusively on leather. Her palette was light and frothy—pale rose, cappuccino, blush tan. But the main strength of the collection lay in the innovative ways in which leather and suede were treated like ordinary fabric. Paneled skirts were clipped asymmetrically at the hem, resembling glued-together strips of Band-Aids; an extraordinary one-shoulder black dress was twisted into a knot and suspended by a single strap of spaghettilike leather cords. Roomy trousers were pleated along the side and cuffed, worn with a light top and held together with a sash belt. Even the shoes made a statement—gathered pumps and mesh ankle boots grounded the looks.</p><p>Kokosalaki’s silhouette clearly referenced the ’80s, but the end result was fresh and innovative, thanks especially to the skill with which skins were manipulated.</p></div>"
88,spring,2001,s2001,russell-sage,"Russell Sage's clothes always have a personal touch to them. Last season, the designer scoured musty flea markets and off-the-beaten-path antique shops for fabrics. This time around, Sage went skydiving in the name of fashion, using his old parachute to create many looks in his collection.</p><p>Voluminous, '50s-inspired skirts, translucent jackets with flag inlays and antique-looking prints all conveyed a feeling of dejected chic. A deconstructed upside-down jacket and a sharp, orange-piped pantsuit looked surprisingly wearable, as did a beautiful oriental-print top and several asymmetric skirts. The one truly puzzling—and questionable—look in the collection was a bare-back sheath with the logo for <em>Face</em> magazine spray-painted on the front.</p><p>The relationship between clothing and personal history is certainly an intriguing one, and it will be interesting to see how Sage continues to explore this idea.</p></div>"
89,spring,2001,s2001,saint-laurent,"A black carpet flanked by shirtless, sharply suited boys and girls led guests through Paris' Musée Rodin to an impressive black tent, dimly illuminated with fluorescent purple lights, where Tom Ford presented the most anticipated collection of the week. It's a perfect moment to update Saint Laurent's legacy: In a season devoted to powerful women, a new strong-shouldered le smoking, for example, is a must-have item. Throw a light, oversize coat over it, and the night is yours. Ford's new YSL woman also commands attention with sexy minidresses equipped with torso-hugging corsets and straps that twist around the body; others are short in front, with a square-cut panel trailing behind. And what about the street? Try the new generously cut, cropped trousers with a crisp white shirt tucked inside and billowed in the back.</p><p>Ford's strategy was a success because of its directness and simplicity. Very cleverly, Ford reinterpreted only a few essential Saint Laurent favorites—all in black and white—creating a strong, recognizable image for the house, and leaving considerable terrain to explore in the future.</p></div>"
90,spring,2001,s2001,sally-penn,"Born in England, Sally Penn grew up in New Zealand and studied at the Sydney College of the Arts in Australia. She moved to New York in 1994 and soon after was selling her designs at Steven Alan's downtown boutique. Penn's show was full of perfect looks for hip East Village girls. In addition to her signature sporty separates such as striped sleeveless tops, hip-slung pants and tennis-style skirts, she showed cowl-neck tops and dresses.</p></div>"
91,spring,2001,s2001,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel knows a thing or two about the '80s, so it came as no surprise that she managed to play up fashion's current infatuation with fluorescent colors, tight knits, minidresses and anything Fiorucci. Rykiel managed to show well over 100 looks and make them all seem breezy, easy and fun. Gaggles of girls pranced onstage in groups in sleek black bathing suits with metal rings, body-hugging acid yellow, pink, blue and green tube dresses, and the season's requisite bias jerseys in vivid prints. Several very grown-up black dresses and suits with multiple golden zippers added a fetishistic touch to the collection.</p><p>Rykiel embraced the favorable fashion moment and showed why she is considered a true fashion icon. Very few designers have proved to have such staying power—and even fewer have as much fun designing as she does.</p></div>"
92,spring,2001,s2001,sophia-kokosalaki,"After seeing Sophia Kokosalaki's collection today, it was easy to understand why she was appointed to design for Ruffo Research this year. Kokosalaki has quite a way with skins, a highly developed sense of color and the ability to build upon diverse references to create directional fashion.</p><p>Color-blocked leather tops in soft pink, forest green and rich brown paired with flouncy, light skirts opened the show. Grecian-inspired gathered shirts and dresses followed, mixed with spine-pleat leather trousers, wide belts and mesh leather overlays. There was nothing kitschy or self-indulgent about the mix—the ruffled sheer tops with streamers and leather cuffs, pegged trousers and slashed-hem skirts all looked perfectly original and in tune with the fashion moment.</p><p>Kokosalaki provided some of the most brilliant interpretations of this season's must-have draped dress: There was an elaborate black gown with horizontal and vertical gathering, as well as several liquid copper numbers with ruched sleeves and side seams that were not only highly original but perfectly chic.</p></div>"
93,spring,2001,s2001,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber's models painted quite a picture when they filed down the aisle and waited for the designer to take his bow. Was this the casting call for a new version of <em>Flash Gordon</em>? <em>Return to the Planet of the Space-Age Vixens</em>?</p><p>Webber's very gutsy gals wore everything from red and black leather tops with a shoulder flap, and one-legged and one-armed bodysuits, to top-heavy, silver-trimmed jackets that could've been cut with an Exacto knife, and tiny skirts that exposed skin-tight fetish rubber stockings. Built-in hoods on poured-on satin shirts, exaggerated motorcycle jackets and side-slit trousers were the tamer pieces of a truly outrageous collection.</p><p>Webber's show was a powerful styling exercise, and there is no doubt that he has considerable tailoring skills. But it would've been nice to see at least one piece that could be worn on the street.</p></div>"
94,spring,2001,s2001,tuleh,"Tuleh partners Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley chose a perfect setting for their Spring show: Sotheby's 10th-floor gallery. The designers accessorized their colorful collection with pieces from the auction house's ""Flora and Fauna"" estate jewels, which will be shown to the public in October.</p><p>The match worked: Inspired by Antonio Lopez's fashion illustrations, the duo envisioned ""a woman caught somewhere between grace and the devil, enjoying every second of the ride."" This translated into cheerful printed chiffon dresses with streamers at the cuff, waist or shoulder, some with slit sleeves, all boasting tremendous swagger.</p><p>The lighthearted mood continued with sweet multicolored polka-dotted tops in candy colors, a ruffled strapless black dress, and an off-the-shoulder purple-and-black striped shell with matching asymmetric skirt. But good girls need to have fun too, and Tuleh delivered the goods with skimpy minishorts, glittering jeans, spiky Louboutin heels and an evening dress that most closely resembled a feather orgy.</p></div>"
95,spring,2001,s2001,ungaro-couture,"Lacy see-through dresses have always been one of Ungaro's specialties. This season he ran with the theme, and created a sexy collection that alluded to old-school glamour with a modern twist.</p><p>Ungaro's palette was dreamy and naive: mint julep, pale yellow, rose petal pink, salmon and sporadic shocks of purple. His gowns were sweetly embroidered, draped and appliquéd, but they were also tattered, tied and twisted. Wide belts with large suede flowers and dangling cords and streamers gave the silhouette a feeling of dejected chic. Ungaro also offered some perfectly cut trousers, worn with frayed, ruffled blazers that will look great dressed down with crisp dark jeans. The fitting finale for his presentation: All the girls wafted onstage gradually, forming a chic pastel tableau.</p></div>"
96,spring,2001,s2001,valentino,"Valentino has far too strong of a personal sense of style to let himself go with the trends—don't even <em>dream</em> about pop '80s references here. Instead, he delivered the polished, elegant clothes that his devoted clientele can always expect.</p><p>Small wool or embroidered silk ponchos were a recurring element for both day and evening; linen and crepe suits looked sharp and sexy, fastened at the waist with a delicate bow. Sporty blouson jackets with zippers, balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses and skinny trousers were both relaxed and absolutely proper. The dresses made a bolder statement, evoking the laid-back grandeur of the French Riviera: Organza, taffeta and georgette gowns were printed with polka dots, large florals and graphic animal motifs in shades of chartreuse, mango and, naturally, Valentino red. Evening teetered on the decadent, with slender columns and minute, short dresses that dazzled with a shower of sequins in gold and pink—presumably, Valentino's recipe for a night of excess.</p></div>"
97,spring,2001,s2001,vera-wang,"Vera Wang is a favorite of big-event socialites and high-profile celebrities—after all, her designs can always be counted on to make an audience draw breath. This season was no exception: Wang opened her show with a rich orange zip-front caftan that could be worn with a hood up for movie star-grandeur or down for a casually chic look.</p><p>Hand-painted Jackson Pollock-like prints adorned A-line and sack dresses, a motif that carried on to evening with ""scribble"" beading. There were also a couple of impeccable double-faced wool coats worn with a leather tie belt, and a plethora of simple, carefully detailed chiffon Empire dresses.</p></div>"
98,spring,2001,s2001,versace,"A sudden downpour did not keep anyone away from Donatella Versace's high-powered show, including guests of honor Courtney Love, Christina Ricci and Bruce Willis.</p><p>Lou Reed's ""Vicious"" was an appropriate theme for the skin-hugging white leather skirts, draped chiffon dresses with corset-like belts and bloused boat-neck tops that opened the show. Donatella's mood was relentlessly sexy: Clingy jersey dresses followed, ruched, bat-sleeved or off the shoulder, sometimes hanging on for dear life from a single strap. Black patent-leather coats and dresses, metallic-heeled pumps and nude backs screamed for a night of sin. Less conspicuous looks included Grecian floor-length gowns and brick, magenta and cobalt paint-splattered cocktail dresses that will surely be a spring favorite.</p><p>With her adrenaline-pumped vision of glamour, high-energy shows and talent for cutting perfect little party dresses that attract paparazzi by the flock, it's no wonder Versace's show has become the social event of the season in Milan.</p></div>"
99,spring,2001,s2001,versus-versace,"Practically every single one of Spring's big trends turned up at Versus—from the cranberry gathered-waist cocktail looks that opened the show, to the black halter dresses with slashed cut-outs and nude backs, to the motorcycle jackets —here in satin— that cinched at the waist and billowed at the shoulders. Black lace dresses came sprinkled with rhinestones, while tight ruched skirts and skimpy dresses were accessorized with double-turn belts and large stone buckles. There were also tank tops with streamers and bunched straps, aqua-and-copper printed pantsuits and even a few frankly unflattering culottes-and-blazer combos.</p><p>Since it is a diffusion line, it's understandable that Versus would want to provide accessible looks to its younger clientele. But, as it was, the collection did that and not much more—a sense of evolution, or at least a hint of that old-school Versace flair, was sadly absent.</p></div>"
100,spring,2001,s2001,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro's collection relied on a flowing, breezy silhouette to create a feeling of retro chic. His 46 looks, all in shades of cappuccino, peach, lilac and blush, alluded to the sensual style of a Concorde-hopper circa 1982: There were delicate georgette wraps, pleated satin dresses and generously cut dolman knit tops. Even the most casual looks— an apricot silk knit tube top, walnut suede shorts and feather-light gauze tunics—exuded this imagined brand of luxury.</p><p>There is no doubt that Alfaro has considerable talent and can produce stylish, wearable clothes. Still, his collection relied too heavily on references to the past, as if unsure of making a more directional statement.</p></div>"
101,spring,2001,s2001,viktor-rolf,"There's no business like show business: At a grand old theater on Avenue Wagram, Viktor &amp; Rolf staged a tap-dancing event in the best tradition of Hollywood's golden years.</p><p>A procession of nimble, nubile girls with Louise Brooks bobs and glittering eyelashes high-kicked, stomped and shimmied their way onto the stage, wearing beige, white and light-denim pantsuits, Mackintoshes and pleated shorts. Silver trims on lapels and cuffs, and scalloped edges and ruffles on pristine white shirts, shone in the spotlight. Black tuxedos with wide pants looked adorable rather than severe when accessorized with delicate hair bows; fitted black suits dazzled with white piping. To close the show, the designers themselves took to the stage and executed a perfect dance routine. Now <em>that's</em> entertainment!</p><p>The event was an undisputed crowd pleaser: At one point, as the music segued from ""Singing in the Rain"" to a bizarre tap/hip-hop redux, André Leon Talley, Isabella Blow and Mario Testino all jammed discreetly in their seats. Best of all, we can be sure that Viktor &amp; Rolf's clothes look good on women of all sizes—there was not a 6-foot supermodel in sight. All of the girls on stage were dance students from the Lucia Marthas academy in Holland.</p></div>"
102,spring,2001,s2001,vivienne-tam,"Vivienne Tam doesn't have much luck with weather. Last year, Hurricane Floyd wreaked havoc on New York Fashion Week, forcing Tam to reschedule her show. And today, rains of Biblical proportions descended upon Bryant Park just in time for her presentation. Undaunted, Tam marched on—her models making their entrances with appropriately damp and tousled hair.</p><p>Tam is at her best with accessible, easy-to-wear clothes like the Chrysler-print dresses and black leather jackets and skirts that opened her show. There was also an interesting matte jersey dolman dress with a metal choker that looked much fresher than her heavily beaded, overly ornate looks. A white skirt with a sparse, geometric sprinkling of crystals, worn with a simple berry cardigan, was far chicer than the overdone pink and blue computer-print sequined looks. In Tam's case, less is often more.</p></div>"
103,spring,2001,s2001,wink,"Love was in the air at Wynn Smith's Spring collection. Thematically the show—which consisted of five vignettes—was about an Amish girl who saw pictures of Prince William at a polo match and fell in love with him. The show began with four all-black ensembles and closed with a wedding dress (also black, with a quilted appliqué) and two ""bridesmaids.""</p><p>The ""Polo Match"" and ""Eton"" vignettes featured man-tailored separates made of Prince of Wales plaid, which was meant to evoke an English feel. A shirt-jacket and shorts ensemble, as well as white shorts cut like jodhpurs, were particularly effective.</p><p>This season Smith paid homage to Rei Kawakubo (much as he did to Stephen Sprouse last Fall). To this end, there were many interesting back treatments, cutouts and asymmetries. Thematic organizations aside, there were strong pieces to be found in this collection, which followed its own plot line rather than the season's trends.</p></div>"
104,spring,2001,s2001,yohji-yamamoto,"This season, Yohji Yamamoto turned his attention to suiting and draping—swathing and wrapping the body in his unique, highly evolved manner.</p><blockquote class=""BlockquoteEmbedWrapper-sc-SdiGL cISoXl blockquote-embed""><div class=""BlockquoteEmbedContent-esRbGs gkrpNW blockquote-embed__content""><p>br&gt; His masculine take on pinstripes and black suits consisted of strong-shouldered, side-fastening coat jackets with long, asymmetric tails. Trousers were loose and sometimes oversize: There was a huge-waisted pair cinched at the hips, with excess fabric dangling at the side. Fluid black dresses were gathered at the side and featured a train that could be attached to the wrist, the hem draping around the body. Deceptively simple-looking columns had extra panels that could become practical pockets; there was also a sumptuously knit sweater, skirt and tote combo.</p></div></blockquote><p>Experimentation is a given at any Yamamoto show, so it was no surprise when fluid gowns appeared complete with built-in bags. Some were cinched and attached to the back of the dress, while others, strategically placed on the side, became perfect hand warmers. The most dazzling look: a flowing strap dress with a sequined coin purse, complete with hardware clasp, resting at the back—the perfect marriage between function and design.</p></div>"
1,fall,2001,f2001,alberta-ferretti,"Models wafted onstage in a zig-zag pattern on Alberta Ferretti's extra-wide runway, ultimately forming a gray and black army of perfectly nice girls exploring their more daring side.</p><p>There was a vintage feeling to many of Ferretti's short velvet dresses, wool minishifts and top-stitched leather coats. Everyday basics included sharp, straight trousers, chiffon aqua shirts, pearly satin tops and skirts pleated at the knee. Ferretti's main strength remains her way with frothy, delicate femininity—in her hands, last season's punky strapped dresses became subtly knotted and gathered slips embellished with short streamers and beaded insets, Empire-waist baby-doll dresses, and rough-cut (but always delicate and feather-light) sheaths.</p></div>"
2,fall,2001,f2001,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Fall for Alessandro Dell'Acqua is all about strong femininity. The designer played with many of the recurring themes that have surfaced in recent seasons—asymmetric sheer dresses, layered transparencies and hard-edged suits—and made them his own.</p><p>Relying mostly on a stark palette of black, white and tan, Dell'Acqua played up the contrast between softness and strength for which he is well-known. Sheer tulle tops wafted over bondage-like bandeau straps. Satin blazers and pencil skirts provided a sleek alternative to paillette-trimmed chiffon skirts and flouncy dresses. Sleek leather trousers and bombers, tuxedolike coats and metal-heeled strap boots also looked sharp.</p><p>As if to remind us that minimalism (and his signature underwear line) can be perfectly sexy, Dell'Acqua sent all the models out for their final tour of the runway in nothing but skimpy body maillots.</p></div>"
3,fall,2001,f2001,alexander-mcqueen,"Colorful lights, a merry-go-round, the sound of children? Alexander McQueen's mise-en-scène brought to mind family trips, fun and games, and maybe a couple of lighthearted mimes.</p><p>But once the lights went down and the blaring soundtrack began, it became perfectly clear that there was nothing even remotely candy-coated about his lascivious carnival crashers. Cavorting and gyrating around poles, a posse of hard-as-nails girls took over the stage wearing shiny patent-leather jackets and jeans, scalloped coats and skirts, S&amp;M overcoats, skintight leather pants and ornate military jackets that would've put Napoleon to shame. A nearly naked princess turned up in little more than a feathered headdress, a net gown and a few chains; her cohorts wore frayed sweaters with giant skulls and bones, and long suit jackets that became dresses as they wrapped around the body and then draped at the side.</p><p>When the frantic pace finally slowed down, it was to reveal an eerie backdrop of gigantic stuffed animals, discarded dolls, puppets, balloons and ragged circus paraphernalia, out of which several macabre characters emerged, wearing massive ruffles, centuries-old suits and beat-up lace. The perfect accessory? One of McQueen's otherworldly creatures dragged around a golden skeleton with her foot.</p></div>"
4,fall,2001,f2001,alexandre-matthieu,"In a grandiose salon of France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, complete with glittering chandeliers, fresco ceilings and gilded walls, newcomers Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau presented their second formal collection.</p><p>Emphasizing their love of tailoring, Morgado and Bureau went for precise, low-buttoned tuxedo jackets with rounded lapels paired with double-cuff trousers; graphic star prints were shown layered on dresses to create a quasi-holographic effect, while leather jackets and traditional frocks were cheekily adorned with swirling ribbons. Alexandre Matthieu's playful take on ladylike dressing included a cross-your-heart puff of fur, a long dress with a trompe-l'oeil bolero detail, and a beaded silver-and-black coat worn with stockings that would've looked perfectly appropriate on an extravagant circus ringmistress.</p><p>Forgoing the heavy-handed conceptualism of many new designers in favor of a light, joyous approach to design, Morgado and Bureau are well on their way to carving out a distinctive niche for themselves.</p></div>"
5,fall,2001,f2001,alice-roi,"For her collection inspired by ""educated virgins,"" Alice Roi combined dollhouse jewelry (made from real dollhouse furniture) and could-not-possibly-be-any-shorter minis. Her selection of the Honoré Daumier print <em>La Caricature</em> (a drawing of two snobs turning up their noses at each other), which turned up on dresses and tops, exemplified her love of parody and play.</p><p>Eighties references were on hand in a pair of Sebagos with heels, super-bright colors and asymmetries. But pervasive sailor styles, dropped waists, pleated skirts and leg-of-mutton sleeves referenced the early '20s. One standout was an almost preppy sweater with a sailing motif, worn with one straight and one puffy sleeve. And a black cashmere minidress with a <em>La Caricature</em> banner would have made Coco Chanel proud.</p></div>"
6,fall,2001,f2001,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester's clothes have soul. With a predominantly black aesthetic dominating and practically every designer jumping on the tough-edge bandwagon, her subtle, richly textured designs appear particularly meaningful this season.</p><p>Case in point: Demeulemeester showed a selection of looks that surely required several courses in engineering to complete, but that still managed to look absolutely effortless on the runway. A jacket billowed out to form a cape in the back but came with faux sleeves stitched to the side—in fact, two hidden slits allowed the arms to escape in case of extreme necessity; a hidden cincture dramatically surfaced in the front, giving the silhouette a seemingly inexplicable pinch. Demeulemeester's loose sweater dresses were gathered with multiple-strand skinny belts; leather jackets sat at the hips, while a monastic high-collar coat nearly grazed the floor.</p><p>Occasional flashes of color included clouds of dark red on billowy shirts that offered a delicate contrast to the starker looks. A serene, moody soundtrack perfectly complemented the well-thought-out collection.</p></div>"
7,fall,2001,f2001,anna-sui,"The key to Anna Sui's look is her constant juggling of cultural references—a madcap mixing of diverse styles and time periods. For Fall, Sui's stylistic collage includes graphic, two-tone wool knit jackets and mod shift-dresses, layers of tweed piled upon each other, colorful pop floral shirts with matching ties and patent-leather motorcycle jackets.</p><p>Sui struck a chord with her vision of a modern-day Carnaby Street dandy: Glittery pants, beaded paisley shirts and long, mixed-weave coats made you want to stay out all night. Her wide-wale corduroy pants, long military coats and black velvet strapless dresses with voluminous skirts proved that she can make quieter statements as well. Things got a bit out of control with pirate hats, metallic leather coats and multicolor patchwork numbers, but some would argue that over-the-top attitude has always been a part of Sui's allure.</p></div>"
8,fall,2001,f2001,antonio-berardi,"It's an undisputed fact that Antonio Berardi knows how to cut a mean, lean pair of trousers and an ultrasexy dress. One wishes, however, that the designer would direct his energies in more controlled ways.</p><p>Berardi's show felt like a wild fireworks display. Fitted jackets were reversed to button in the back, lacy white lingerie tops morphed into flared rockabilly skirts and enormous shearling coats were savagely sliced. As if all this weren't enough, Berardi threw in distressed jeans lavished with buttons, whale-bone corsets, layered sheer slips, and hot-pink and acid-yellow gowns drowning in ruffles.</p><p>Some of these looks will guarantee a night of fun out on the town, but others, like the shaved-fur cargo Bermuda shorts, should never have made it past the drawing board.</p></div>"
9,fall,2001,f2001,arkadius,"""Prostitution"" was the theme for what Arkadius described as his most salable collection to date. ""This is a reaction to those who attack designers because they create commercial clothes,"" said Arkadius, proudly wearing a jacket stamped with call-girl ads. ""Are designers prostitutes when we meet people halfway?""</p><p>Arkadius did show less extravagant clothes than usual, including net tops and plenty of sensible skirts and jackets with flattering button trims. ""Until my dream of streets that look like catwalks comes true,"" said Arkadius, ""designers have to find a way to survive."" But no one need worry that the Polish-born designer will be competing with the Gap anytime soon; his presentation still featured plenty of independent-minded verve. Loose pinstripe pants were worn with a sleeveless knit top that looked as if it were about to disintegrate; sheepskin dresses, muskrat corsets and head-trapping balloons shouldn't be turning up in corporate boardrooms anytime soon.</p></div>"
10,fall,2001,f2001,badgley-mischka,"""Our collection is a lot younger this season,"" said Mark Badgley backstage. ""We've added a lot of day looks. Of course, our day begins at around 5 p.m.""</p><p>Badgley Mischka's version of sensible, go-anywhere looks included everything from body-hugging burgundy leather ensembles, pleated satin skirts, spaghetti-strap bustier tops, cowl-neck gold sweaters, shearling jackets and even a couple of monotone corduroy looks. But publicity-crazed starlets shopping for their Oscar selections needn't panic—there are still plenty of sequin-drenched gowns to attract hordes of paparazzi, and an attention-grabbing tuxedo with a fitted jacket and flowing trousers.</p><p>Badgley Mischka provided some sensible alternatives to their well-known repertoire of event-tailored dresses, but their collection would've benefited from a thoughtful edit and a more defined point of view.</p></div>"
11,fall,2001,f2001,balenciaga,"All week long, the question on everybody's mind was: What would Nicolas Ghesquière, the man who has been dubbed “fashion's new messiah,” do to top himself at Balenciaga?</p><p>Ghesquière's success has everything to do with his ability to subtly evoke a variety of references, altogether avoiding clichés and creating clothes that are richly layered in meaning and almost impossible to categorize. The early 1900s were a point of departure for his black-and-gray collection, but Ghesquière's architectural and impeccably executed designs soon took on a life all their own. Tight vests created hourglass silhouettes, some with exaggerated hips; front plackets on tops were tightly wound and crisscrossed like lace-up corsets. His fitted trousers, which have a devout cult following, were studded to match buckle jackets; miniskirts came with layer upon layer of ruffles, pleats, tassels, and appliqués that never looked redundant or heavy-handed.</p><p>Given his ongoing success, will Ghesquière launch his own label anytime soon? “I'm very happy at Balenciaga,” said the designer after the show. “But I also want to work on my own line. The ideal would be to do both things simultaneously.”</p></div>"
12,fall,2001,f2001,bcbg-max-azria,"It's not hard to understand why BCBG has a substantial following all over the world—designer Max Azria has an uncanny ability to appropriate major currents in fashion and make them accessible to a general market.</p><p>Accompanied by an earsplitting soundtrack of mid-'90s Prodigy techno, Azria sent out everything from moleskin trenches and trousers to leather strip jackets, scalloped minidresses and pleated bustiers that brought to mind Helmut Lang's Spring dominatrix-inspired collection. As if to make sure not to miss a single trend, Azria also included corduroy suits, flouncy chiffon dresses, glimmering Lurex tops and plenty of waist-sculpting leather cage belts in the spirit of Tom Ford's recent corseted Gucci collection.</p><p>Accessories ran the gamut from simple black leather pumps and slides to punky ankle booties and frankly intriguing bags with thick chain handles and dangling adornments.</p></div>"
13,fall,2001,f2001,behnaz-sarafpour,"In an age when designers routinely shoot to fame by way of hype and self-promotion, Behnaz Sarafpour is counting on her solid training and precise eye to put her a step above the competition. At 31, Sarafpour has worked with Narciso Rodriguez, Richard Tyler and, most notably, Isaac Mizrahi; as if this weren';t enough, she also designs Barneys New York's private label.</p><p>""My debut collection is about a new, modern take on black-tie dressing"" she says.""For example, I took the classic satin strip of men's tuxedo trousers and reworked it into a rose-puff bolero shrug."" Other highlights include a dashing cashmere top paired with white sailor pants and a sexy one-sleeve cocktail dress that was painstakingly hand-beaded.</p><p>Whether it's a simple cotton crepe camisole, a stretch lace shirt or a sharp, masculine suit, Sarafpour invariably turns out modern, sophisticated clothes that already seem destined to withstand the test of time.</p></div>"
14,fall,2001,f2001,benjamin-cho,"Having tested the waters with smaller presentations in the past, up-comer Benjamin Cho showed a full-fledged collection this season, proving that he is one of New York's most promising young talents.</p><p>Cho's impressive tailoring skills were abundantly clear in his deconstructed crepe suits that morphed into flowing capes: A long jacket was sharply cropped to form a minidress, while its sleeves ballooned to enormous proportions and created a draped back. A black bustier corset gave way to a braided dress with tassels cascading over a long fishtail skirt, while a clean, crisp white shirtdress was anchored down with a triple-loop waist tie.</p><p>Cho also showed a couple of stunning wide-knit dresses that sensually hugged every curve of the body and looked as if they were held together by the mercy of God.</p></div>"
15,fall,2001,f2001,bernhard-willhelm,"At Paris' legendary Moulin Rouge, Bernhard Willhelm ran full speed ahead with a powerful, beautiful and at times slightly overwhelming presentation.</p><p>Gone were last season's adorable little homemakers with embroidered aprons and Heidi-like demeanor. Willhelm replaced them with tribes of nomads that wore long, striped overcoats, monastic dresses, twisted tops and kimono-style jackets. A giant projection of dancing skeletons served as a backdrop for colorful patchwork skirts, fringed shirts, argyle sweaters and tapestry-inlaid coats. Willhelm also showed several looks stamped with a random list of first names, which resembled a meaningless barrage of newspaper-print logos. Spanking-white sneakers kept the looks fresh and focused.</p><p>Willhelm's collection could've used a bit of editing, but with this show it's clear that the German-born designer is one to watch very closely in the future.</p></div>"
16,fall,2001,f2001,betsey-johnson,"With an old key that dangled from a strand of pink ribbon, Betsey Johnson opened wide the doors to her closet for all the world to see. Out from Pandora's box sprang an array of mini-Betseys: All Johnson's models wore assorted hair extensions, a lightning-bolt tattoo on their chests, and plenty of lace teddies, net tutus in neon colors, striped Clamdiggers, Lurex-knit mini-tops and an abundance of corsets.</p><p>In Johnson's universe, a party dress is printed with pterodactyls and sweeping birds; sweaters have different-colored sleeves, and velveteen coats are thrown over camouflage wool-knit dresses. Trousers for a pantsuit are cut low enough to allow a sliver of acid-green underwear to peek out, and jackets are snapped as close to the body as possible. Modern-day cancan girls cavort in emerald, sapphire and fuchsia brassiere tops, layered transparencies, and glittering heels that are part <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and part Times Square after dark.</p><p>""These are clothes that I love,"" said Johnson simply. ""I wanted to create a whole new wardrobe for myself—and hopefully, for many others as well!""</p></div>"
17,fall,2001,f2001,bill-blass,"Passing the torch in a venerable fashion house is a dangerous game. Expectations from clients, buyers and critics run high when legendary shoes are to be filled. When Bill Blass retired last year, Steven Slowik was handed the reigns and faced with a daunting Catch-22: Stay true to Blass' consummately conservative roots but innovate enough to spark some precious fashion buzz. Slowik missed the target by a long shot in the single awkward and unflattering collection he designed at Blass, and was promptly shown the door.</p><p>So this January, with only a month before the Fall 2001 shows, Bill Blass Ltd. found itself flying without a pilot and pulled up one of its staff designers, the Swedish-born and Paris-trained Lars Nilsson, to put together a collection. And in a few short weeks, Nilsson pulled together a robust collection of unmistakably Bill Blass clothes: bold red cashmere coats, pinstripe suits and trim satin trenchcoats. The core of Nilsson's style is conservative enough to fit the Bill Blass image, with plush fabrics and familiar shapes, but the Swedish designer keeps it all looking current with minimal embellishments and sleek tailoring.</p></div>"
18,fall,2001,f2001,blaak,"Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, the duo behind Blaak, met while studying fashion design at Central Saint Martins and have been inseparable ever since. Their debut collection, which they showed in 1998 while still in college, was immediately snapped up by London's hip Browns Focus boutique, which has carried the label ever since. Blaak's strength lies in translating forward-thinking ideas into accessible clothes that retain a distinct air of individuality. Take their Fall collection, where traditional preppy style was reinterpreted with deep-plunging pink vests, sensible button-downs, and snappy pencil skirts decorated with trompe l'oeil bows and crisscrossed ribbons. More daring experiments included puff-sleeve tops, generous prom skirts in bright hues, and quasi-military jackets with substantial epaulets that were pinned over and in front of the shoulders like folded wings.<br/>&lt;r&gt;Designed for a young, urban and in-the-know clientele, Blaak's clothes effortlessly convey a spirit of quiet subversion.&lt;/r&gt;</p></div>"
19,fall,2001,f2001,bottega-veneta,"Bottega Veneta creative director Laura Moltedo officially appointed British newcomer Giles Deacon designer of the well-known leather label this season. With this move, and after having been recently purchased by the Gucci conglomerate, Bottega Veneta is undergoing a major face-lift that could lead to a completely new identity.</p><p>Deacon made no bones about the house's shift in direction. Weathered, zippered and extra-wide jeans opened the show, followed by tiny miniskirts slashed with zippers and funky jackets with flashy metallic fastenings. A leather puffy jacket was drop-dead cool; the same can be said of a woven-leather overcoat and a couple of black corduroy suits with leather shoulder insets. A series of green-and-yellow logo looks was not as successful; but on the whole, Deacon established a strong, dramatic image that is sure to put the spotlight on Bottega Veneta.</p></div>"
20,fall,2001,f2001,boudicca,"You will not be wearing Boudicca’s clothing to the grocery store, to work or even to a nightclub. As a matter of fact, unless you’re the guest of honor at a museum reception for an exhibition on deconstruction and architecture, it’s unlikely that you will find much use at all for a striped pantsuit with tie sashes across the legs and breasts, or an enormous, stiff leather corset with positively dangerous edges.</p><p>Of course, fashion is not just about cashmere twin sets—and, to be fair, Boudicca did show several wearable looks, like a belted cream Kimono coat worn over culottes, an aged leather coat with paneled insets and several beautifully draped dresses with gold straps. Still, at a moment when even the most intellectual fashion seems to be moving away from angst-ridden conceptualism, Boudicca’s dramatic clothes, however beautiful they may be, look at times as if they were <em>behind</em> and not <em>ahead</em> of the times.</p></div>"
21,fall,2001,f2001,bruce,"To the romantic South American tune of <em>Tuyo Es Mi Corazón</em>, the downtown design team of Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli opened New York Fashion Week with a carefully planned, immaculately executed collection (sponsored by Shishido), that delivered a thoroughly modern idea of chic.</p><p>This fall, Bruce girls will still rely on those well-known slim trousers that lengthen the legs for miles—only now they’re done in the softest possible corduroy, and paired with delicately draped tops, fitted blazers with pleated lapels and formfitting leather jackets. For drinks on the town, there are sexy jersey dresses that allude to the current Grecian craze but avoid falling into a facile disco-princess retro vibe, thanks to their looser cut and smart touches like asymmetric necklines, gathered sleeves and embroidered details.</p><p>“The general look is very linear, but manipulated to create movement and follow the natural draping of the fabric,” said Gutierrez before the show. “The effect is very subtle from a distance, but when you inspect the clothes up close, you realize there’s a tremendous amount of work involved.”</p></div>"
22,fall,2001,f2001,burberry-prorsum,"Roberto Menichetti not only wants to update Burberry's image; he is intent on propelling the label into the future by exploring the interaction between classic notions of elegance and cutting-edge materials.</p><p>Menichetti kept frills to a minimum, working with a restrained palette of pale gray, navy, beige and putty; roomy safari coats with chic tunnel belts were thrown over sensible shirts and trousers in ""stretch"" and ""carbon,"" new fabrics that maintain the body's temperature. But technological fibers met their match with fine boiled cashmere turtlenecks, wool gabardine wrap skirts, and milk-soaked leather overcoats and motorcycle jackets. Menichetti also showed a couple of large-cut blazers that revived a vintage version of Burberry's signature plaid and looked subtle and restrained, in keeping with the minimal spirit of the collection.</p></div>"
23,fall,2001,f2001,cacharel,"Cardboard chandeliers, fake little chairs and painted-on curtains at Clements Ribeiro's show for Cacharel announced that the couple was in a playful mood.</p><p>With their ""cari-couture"" collection, Clements Ribeiro succeeded once again in injecting Cacharel with a girly, playful spirit, revisiting fashion clichés with an ironic eye. The trompe-l'oeil theme that has been so prevalent this season was everywhere here: Western shirts had printed-on pockets and stitches, gray suits flaunted make-believe tassels and pretty dresses were embellished with faux bows and necklaces. Toto-like dogs formed a black, red and white optic print on otherwise prim and proper skirts and tops; fly-away dresses were crawling with panthers or trimmed in star-shaped rhinestones.</p><p>Amid the fun, Clements Ribeiro didn't forget to include all the basics a cool Cacharel girl will require next Fall: a boyish tuxedo blazer, a flashy corduroy suit and coat (choose between purple or red), a few sweatshirts, plenty of two-tone heels and ankle booties, and even a couple of short little fur vests.</p></div>"
24,fall,2001,f2001,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein closed New York Fashion Week with a hard-edged, no-nonsense collection that neatly encapsulates the pared-down aesthetic that is a key component for Fall.</p><p>It’s a perfect moment for Klein, who clearly feels right at home designing austere, stylish basics with a mannish twist. In his hands, the most subtle details are all it takes to make a difference: His black wool winter coat, for example, comes with a built-in, low-slung double-loop leather belt that gives it a perfect air of nonchalant chic. A classic peacoat is cut loose and slouchy, as if to emphasize the slim proportions of a short, sexy shift. Klein’s shearling dresses and aged, crackled napa vests, trousers and military coats are perfect for an urban warrior.</p><p>But even the toughest girls need lightness and femininity once in a while, so Klein also sent out plenty of body-skimming asymmetric silk jersey dresses with playful cutouts—just as long as you remember to wear them with tough ankle boots instead of conventional heels.</p></div>"
25,fall,2001,f2001,carolina-herrera,"""It's a very sleek and svelte collection,"" announced Carolina Herrera backstage, as her audience poured into the tents at Bryant Park. ""My emphasis is on creating clothes that are perfect for right now—simplicity works best for me.""</p><p>With fashion winding down from over-the-top excesses of seasons past, Herrera emphasized a slim, unfettered silhouette punctuated by luxurious details like lace embroideries on shirts, asymmetric hemlines on georgette skirts and diamant¿ buckles on tuxedo jackets and dresses. Whimsical pieces included a black leather spinal-pleat wrap jacket, a belted Russian lynx coat and several sleeveless chinchilla sweaters.</p><p>Herrera's evening segment referenced last season's love affair with the early '80s: There were feathered tops, formfitting lace skirts and several off-the-shoulder stretch satin dresses aimed at the younger Park Avenue set.</p></div>"
26,fall,2001,f2001,celine,"Michael Kors' New York equestrienne did not show up at Celine; instead, she turned to Nantucket and Berlin for sartorial inspiration.</p><p>Kors' forte has always been relaxed sportswear—and his opening look, a distressed canvas jean, plaid shirtdress and reversible coyote fur, announced that this was to be a particularly pared-down moment. Checkered skirts and blazers, casual burgundy trousers, zip-up jackets and roomy trenches followed, sometimes accessorized with a plush fur neck-wrap.</p><p>Kors changed gears from the rustic to the hard-edged with military overcoats, naval trousers, battle jackets and S&amp;M-style leather caps that would've driven Marlene Dietrich to delirium. The eclectic melange continued with wisps of lingerie and rugged tweeds; evening looks consisted of long pleated gowns, fragile slip dresses and bed-ready camisoles worn with rugged boots, enormous bouclé coats and savage furs.</p></div>"
27,fall,2001,f2001,cerruti,"Madison Avenue regulars will be delighted to find that Peter Speliopoulos tackled at Cerruti many of the season's recurring themes, making them accessible to a perfectly proper audience.</p><p>His take on masculine tailoring included high-collar button-up shirts, roomy blazers and two-button overcoats with rounded edges. Paillette-encrusted flirty white shifts referenced the mod mood that was so prevalent in Milan. Little capes fluttered over straight trousers, and cocktail dresses revealed geometric flashes of skin in the back. Sexy ribbon dresses, pom-pom-trimmed necklines, and button-lined deep-slit skirts and gowns closed the show.</p><p>Speliopoulos' clothes are certainly chic and polite; but one wishes the designer would take an occasional risk or two and give Cerruti a more directional spin.</p></div>"
28,fall,2001,f2001,chloe,"Stella McCartney continued with her exploration of grown-up, couture-inspired silhouettes for Chloé, without forgetting about the youthful, fun-loving basics that are the label's bread and butter.</p><p>McCartney's forte is her ability to glam up casual street clothes. Her fitted jeans and corduroy trousers with zipper pockets, face-stenciled T-shirts and pearl-encrusted draped tops all had an air of insouciant cool to them; so did the faux furs with shaved bits that accommodated clusters of silver flowers. However, when McCartney turned to complicated floor-length skirts, boned coats and tie-up corsets, the show took a turn for the heavy-handed. Sea-grass embroidery growing on the side of trousers or completely claiming a dress or coat added a more dynamic air to the collection.</p></div>"
29,fall,2001,f2001,christian-dior,"Having thoroughly exhausted the minutiae of white-trash glamour, John Galliano turned to global ravers, fabulous hip-hop queens and Irish-gypsy boxers à la Brad Pitt's character in <em>Snatch</em> for inspiration.</p><p>Sound confusing? Relax. Call it what you will, Galliano delivered some of the most relevant clothes Dior has seen in seasons. Pinstripe suits with leather and flower-print front plackets, neo-dandy check blazers, leather overcoats, rakish hats, and colorful foulards and ties all gave Dior a new—and commercially rewarding—dimension. “Boom box” bags, large circular cases, denim saddle totes and metallic lunchboxes will also keep cash registers busy at Dior boutiques worldwide.</p><p>That's not to say that Galliano was denied his fun. Witness his holographic silver jackets, ghetto-blaster graffiti ensembles, unlined, zigzag chinchillas and shiny patent blousons. In lesser hands the whirlpool of references would've fizzled out, but Galliano's thuggish suits, fandango skirts, gypsy-hippie dresses, patchwork coats, and boxing robes and trousers all worked wonderfully.</p></div>"
30,fall,2001,f2001,christian-lacroix,"As expected, Christian Lacroix stepped in to add a touch of color and whimsy to a predominantly dark, stark season.</p><p>Contrasting solids were played up to the max. Yellow, lime-green and bubblegum-pink turtlenecks were surefire attention grabbers when paired with sorbet furs trimmed with dangling miniature tails and flashy stockings. Lacroix's jackets were reversed and shown over narrow tapestry trousers; a red square-spangled trench shimmered in the light, while a long, black suede dress with studded leather insets and long streamers brought to mind hard-core chic.</p><p>At times, however, Lacroix's flights of fancy strayed off compass, and his runway became a hypnotic jumble of sequins, patchwork, ruffles and color-drenched prints that competed simultaneously for attention.</p></div>"
31,fall,2001,f2001,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro can normally be relied on to deliver chic and accessible clothes with an understated edge. This season, however, the duo aimed for a racier look, with decidedly mixed results.</p><p>Individual pieces worked just fine: A couple of bright rugby shirts spoke of casual cool; a corduroy military jacket with a drawstring waist looked great on Alek Wek. Polka-dotted turtlenecks were lighthearted and sweet, while slim trousers, pencil skirts and paillette-front tops remained sharp and to the point. It's a shame the designers didn't stay on that track: A series of leopard-print bombers, overcoats and trousers looked bizarrely out of place; vampy fur vests and asymmetric fly-away dresses failed to make a forceful statement.</p><p>By attempting to cover too much ground, Clements Ribeiro's collection lost much of its focus.</p></div>"
32,fall,2001,f2001,comme-des-garcons,"Evolution is the name of the game chez Comme des Garçons. “Everything is step-by-step,” Rei Kawakubo once told André Leon Talley. “Ten years ago, 10 years later—it’s all the same to me.” While the designer doesn’t repeat herself, she does revisit concepts. A sub-theme of Kawakubo’s Spring 2001 show, which included pieces made of fetish-y transparent plastic, was the peekaboo game of reveal/conceal. She doubled down on that idea in her Fall 2001 Beyond Taboo collection, which tackled sex—and the material manifestations of erotica—in all its corseted, cone-bra’d, satin, and lace glory.</p><p>This set critics agog. But is sex really so foreign in Kawakubo’s world? While it’s true that the designer rejects the idea that clothes must reveal the body to attract a partner, her use of transparency suggests she’s not a prude. It seems significant that the collection was shown in France, the land in which <em>l’amour</em> is a national sport and where Jean Baudrillard, the postmodern theorist, suggested that “seduction . . . never belongs to the order of nature, but that of artifice—never to the order of energy, but that of signs and rituals.” Defined thus, seduction sounds a lot like fashion, whose often outdated rules and assumptions are fuel to Kawakubo’s fire.</p></div>"
33,fall,2001,f2001,costume-national,"It's an undeniable fact that black reigns supreme this season, but at times runways are acquiring decidedly funereal overtones.</p><p>Ennio Capasa has always favored an austere silhouette, so he surely feels at home now that fashion is infatuated with everything dark. Capasa showed a plethora of jackets—oversize with extra-long sleeves, single- and double-breasted, satin-trimmed and plain—paired with an equally exhaustive range of turtleneck tops that seemed to blend into an endless parade of black. A couple of olive coats with pointed shoulders, a miniskirt or two, and several bright green satin suits did little to lighten the weighty atmosphere.</p><p>Capasa's cocktail dresses—puzzling collages of embroidered lace, satin and leather—played up the all-too-familiar juxtaposition of hard and soft fabrics that most designers are exploring for Fall, but failed to deliver an innovative twist.</p></div>"
34,fall,2001,f2001,cynthia-rowley,"With a cast of characters that included a juggler, an accordion player, a mime and an acrobat, Cynthia Rowley injected high-energy fun into New York fashion week at Manhattan's New Victory Theater.</p><p>Rowley played with cotton-candy party dresses, trompe-l'oeil detailing, outrageous plume wraps, two-toned jester skirts and mismatched stockings to create a veritable vaudeville atmosphere. Not everyone will go for the Pierrot-inspired themes, but Rowley also showed more down-to-earth pieces that included corduroy trousers and coats, merino tees, cable-knit sweaters and moleskin jeans. There were also several great pinstripe pants, jackets with sequined lions embroidered at the shoulder and a couple of sleek takes on classic tuxedos that will work well with the younger set.</p></div>"
35,fall,2001,f2001,d-g,"How to best describe D&amp;G's fabulous, over-the-top rock groupies? Think of them as nostalgic, romantic rebels.</p><p>Dolce &amp; Gabbana's younger customers are the kind of girls who are confident enough to cause a scene in beaded AC/DC concert T-shirts, Debbie Harry ""French Kissin'"" tops, sexy dresses that zip up in front and back, flashy acid-washed jeans and massive faux furs. But naughty girls need love too, and they are willing to reveal their softer side with puff-sleeved Edwardian denim jackets, chiffon blouses with streamers and the season's requisite baby-doll dresses. For quiet moments at home, there are chunky Andean jumpers and huge off-the-shoulder sweater dresses.</p></div>"
36,fall,2001,f2001,daryl-k,"Daryl Kerrigan likes her clothes lean, mean and ultra sexy, and this season she went all the way with her racy aesthetic. Wallflowers be warned: These clothes are not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Kerrigan rocked the house with diamond-tucked vamp dresses, boy blazers that hung over teensy miniskirts, silk bondage pants and a few Edwardian jackets, albeit shrunken and severely tweaked. Toying with male/female stereotypes, Kerrigan went for drab-olive military parkas accessorized by glittery embroidered shawls; a Kraftwerk-like red shirt and black skinny tie looked deadly sharp with a pleated, tight mini.</p><p>Kerrigan also explored draping with a couple of jersey dresses, but the skinny, aggressive looks were the ones that worked best.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hyh41q""></div></div><p>What does a seen-it-all downtown New Yorker wear to a shindig?

Presumably, von Furstenberg's archetypal female is a combination of Tori Spelling, Mary J. Blige and the Hilton sisters, who all lined her front row.</p><p>Longtime DVF devotees will go for the abundance of slinky jersey wraps, body-skimming turtlenecks and playful tie-shoulder tops in graphic prints. But Von Furstenberg is clearly intent on taking her line a step beyond her well-known classics, so this season she's added light tweeds with chiffon insets, laser-cut felt coats, tartan plaids, tailored suits and plenty of slim trousers to the mix. Cocktail hour was inspired by Madame Grés and consisted of asymmetric drawstring jersey gowns, short draped dresses and simple tunics that looked sexy and effortless, if a bit repetitive at times.</p></div>"
38,fall,2001,f2001,dolce-gabbana,"A moss-covered stone water fountain, flowery arches and floors strewn with autumn leaves left no doubt: Romance was in the air at Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But needless to say, the Italian duo's idea of gracious country life is far from sedate.</p><p>From a wooden farmhouse emerged glamorous desert bohemians clad in extra-long hip-hugging, double-belted distressed leather pants, billowy striped tops and dangling fox tails. The vintage feeling continued with fitted corduroy trousers and oversize blazers, flea-market suede and fur jackets, and tattered blue jeans. Dolce and Gabbana clearly had a blast mixing the old and the new; slouchy pants and oversize hobo sweaters and scarves alternated with sheer floral camisoles, sharp military coats with multiple diamanté buckles, Wild West fringed bags and tall prairie boots. In a nutshell: anything and everything a sensible girl could possibly need.</p></div>"
39,fall,2001,f2001,donna-karan,"Donna Karan is famous for her consistently feminine, wearable clothing that speaks to the great diversity of women.</p><p>This season, Karan explored less conventional avenues with a richly textured and layered collection that could best be described as savage luxe. Relying on a relentlessly monochromatic palette, Karan sent out ravaged chiffon skirts, wide-gauge knit sweaters, tribal-inspired patchwork shearling coats, spider-web crochet overlays and severely distressed slips. Evening maintained the raw-edged motif, with gilded dresses that could've been dug out of a centuries-old treasure chest.</p><p>Those who are not adventurous enough to indulge in a post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max</em> makeover will turn to Karan's take on the current equestrian theme, which included khaki cavalry jackets and wrapped riding trousers, as well as aged-leather storm coats.</p></div>"
40,fall,2001,f2001,dries-van-noten,"With spic-and-span white coats, fluffy après-ski jumpers and practical zip-up jackets, Dries Van Noten graciously stepped in to deliver a wave of color and lightness amidst Fall's sea of black.</p><p>Peach leather trenches, speckled blue jeans and gray corduroy suits with important shoulders shone bright on Van Noten's round, immaculate runway. Billowed sleeves, deep necklines and colorful poppy prints livened up long, monastic dresses; classic coats and jackets were anything but boring thanks to quilted lapels, gathered sleeves and, in one case, a built-in trailing scarf.</p><p>Van Noten's accessories underscored the designer's unflinching sense of control. Eye-catching patent pumps, tall boots, fluoro heels and quirky leather caps all effortlessly complemented his airy looks.</p></div>"
41,fall,2001,f2001,emilio-pucci,"How did newly appointed Pucci designer Julio Espada tackle the task of reviving one of the world's most beloved, instantly recognizable labels? With a subtle touch, a modern approach and, above all, lots of respect for a legacy.</p><p>Espada reworked five of Pucci's quintessential swirling floral designs, but mixed them with sharp-cut solids that reflect an urban, practical sensibility. Innovations like a miniature mosaic grid print that creates a trompe-l'oeil tweed effect, a knit Fair Isle sweater with a traditional Pucci print pattern and side-button coats with turtleneck band collars all steered the collection clear of nostalgia.</p><p>Espada was successful in reestablishing Pucci as a name to follow, giving the clothes a contemporary spin while maintaining the house's commitment to elegance with details like bright silk linings, logo-engraved pearl buttons and, of course, the rich, vivid palette that made Emilio Pucci ""the prince of prints"" more than 30 years ago.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tcdr8c""></div></div><p>It will be interesting to see whether Espada will maintain these high standards while taking more daring risks in seasons to come.</p></div>"
42,fall,2001,f2001,emporio-armani,"There were no surprises at Emporio Armani—instead, plenty of the reliable, well-made and affordable basics we have come to expect.</p><p>Everyday pantsuits were loosely cut and sometimes trimmed with white piping; easy chinos were upgraded with a short mottled fur, and optic, geometric sweaters looked casual over shiny white pants. Not everything, however, was sensible day wear: Traditional blazers were spiced up when paired with teensy bikini tops, leather dresses were decorated with diagonal ruffles and paillette tops dazzled over striped trousers. Armani also offered a side-snap black coat with an off-kilter pocket, beaded jackets with floral motifs, shimmering evening slips and an array of black-velvet minidresses.</p></div>"
43,fall,2001,f2001,fendi,"It takes a talent like Karl Lagerfeld to channel 1960s street style, reinterpret it using only black and white, and get away with it.</p><p>Fendi's Fall mod squad stormed the runway in zip-up short furs, white leather trousers and perky minidresses with Courréges-like cutouts that revealed a circular flash of skin; large contrasting zippers served as functional embellishments that ran along the back. Black coats were piped in white, knit turtleneck tops morphed into little leather skirts and silver lapels gave white jackets a bold touch. Lagerfeld only strayed from his two-tone palette to show a couple of gray sheared-fur suits, and a <em>Space Odyssey</em>–silver dress that turned model Devon into a time-warping visitor from the future.</p><p>Accessories included strict Victorian brooches, flat patent- and ostrich-leather boots, and thick, metallic belts that will be among the season's most coveted items.</p></div>"
44,fall,2001,f2001,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré's designs walk the line between fashion and architecture, combining couturelike opulence with careful tailoring and construction.</p><p>Ferré played a game of extremes, mixing and matching dissonant styles. A fur-lined motorcycle jacket, for example, was thrown carelessly over a sharp gray-flannel suit. Pedestrian jeans were decorated with elaborate tartan brocades, masculine origami-style shirts were bound with black armbands and thick-wale corduroy was put at the service of strict lace-up corsets. Ferré's dramatic evening looks veered from tight tailcoats to silver coats with metallic embroidery à la Ziggy Stardust; organza hankies whipped into bouquet tops and gathered jersey dresses that followed the body's every curve.</p></div>"
45,fall,2001,f2001,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani continued to play a game of opposites, firm in his belief that strength and femininity go hand in hand.</p><p>Armani showed short blazers worn over fluid, lightweight trousers. Double-faced caban jackets were cut slightly off the shoulder to give them an informal air. Prince of Wales and striped overcoats hit the floor, emphasizing a fluid silhouette. Armani also showed small bodices paired with full, multitiered skirts and structured dress coats that billowed at the hem.</p><p>Eveningwear was an homage to Picasso's blue period, in varying shades of navy and shimmering with paillettes. Giant sequins glistened under layers of tulle, skirts were flounced and pleated, and raised embroidery decorated spaghetti-strapped tops.</p></div>"
46,fall,2001,f2001,gucci,"Tom Ford opened his show with sharp, narrow trousers and a fitted three-button jacket—the essential Gucci laid-back uniform—making it perfectly clear that mod silhouettes are a key influence for Fall.</p><p>Things got progressively interesting as multiple leather-trimmed zippers and large patch-pockets appeared on coats and pants; ruffled sheer pink tops softened the masculine tailoring, while yeti-like furs and massive lamb coats upped the glamour ante.</p><p>The overall effect of the collection was one of assured sexiness: Short satin dresses with asymmetric necklines, basic tuxedo jackets and skimpy capelets all looked sophisticated and easy to wear. Ford also kept his accessories strong and simple: Coppery ankle-strap heels and flat boots were enough to make a powerful statement.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hsle8n""></div></div><p>For evening, Ford showed a series of sheer lingerie slips with binding brassiere overlays that most women will find less than practical for real life; his square-cut ribbon dresses, equipped with a side zipper for easy escape, were far more arresting.</p></div>"
47,fall,2001,f2001,hamish-morrow,"Amid the many off-schedule shows of London fashion week, newcomer Hamish Morrow's small but extremely powerful presentation decidedly stood out. ""I wanted to explore how ideas in fashion are consumed and discarded at an alarming rate,"" says Morrow, who was recently appointed menswear designer for Fendi and who also consults for Louis Féraud. To get his point across, Morrow used flowers as a leitmotif for his collection, ""since they are fragile and exquisite, and have such a short life span."" Mind you, these were not your typical floral housedresses, which Morrow admittedly detests. Instead, canvas jackets were hand-painted by an artist friend and then embellished with black tulle appliqués that resembled a giant gothic carnation; form-fitting, sheer lace dresses were made out of four large panels cut like petals. ""I like to start with an abstract idea and eventually end up with clothes,"" explains Morrow, who also studded a black tweed and olive green suit with ""big, obnoxious crystal beads that cascade over the body.""</p><p>In contrast to the streetwise but often unpolished designs of other emerging designers, Morrow makes his point with meticulous attention to detail and couturelike workmanship instead of flashy gimmicks.</p></div>"
48,fall,2001,f2001,helmut-lang,"Die-hard fans of sleek power dressing will find plenty of sharp, no-nonsense basics at Helmut Lang come Fall. After Spring’s sex-driven tour de force, the Austrian designer has gone for a more sober approach, referencing some of his own early work in the process.</p><p>Lang’s mostly black collection revolved around many of his well-known classics: Fitted blazers, narrow trousers and sharp-edged coats continue to work as a modern urban uniform. Lang added some eye-catching touches like plush fur linings on overcoats, policeman-like holsters that curled around the shoulder on empire slips and beaded detailing that peeked out from the edge of liquid tops. Other highlights included sexy, off-kilter after-five dresses with only one sleeve and see-through tulle overlays.</p><p>Lang also showed several muted leopard-print suits and skimpy satin dresses with puzzling circular breast pads, but the more straightforward looks were far more commanding.</p></div>"
49,fall,2001,f2001,hermes,"“When we first met,” Martin Margiela said in a 2010 interview with <em>Grazia,</em> Jean-Louis Dumas “asked me anxiously if I was going to cut the Kelly in half because, at the time, the press used the words grunge and destroy to describe my work.” In fact, fashion’s leading deconstructionist was a preservationist at heart, one who was inspired to dismantle conceptions and seams in order to rebuild: “When I recut clothes, old or new,” he told <em>Vogue,</em> “it’s to transform them. It’s my way of bringing them back to life in another form.” At Hermès, what he dismantled was the need for conspicuous consumption by creating a wardrobe of such quality and adaptability that it obviated the need for (many) more clothes.</p><p>Though the surface markers of the old French house didn’t interest him at all, Margiela had a deep understanding of its soul: craftsmanship and fine materials. As a rule, he refused to create scarf prints, but he did apply the technique of hand-rolled seams to garment finishings, and, for 2001, he finally responded to the management’s plea for a scarf with the <em>losange.</em> Long and narrow, made of a solid color of monochrome silk twill crepe with contrasting edges, this was the scarf stripped bare—and all the better for it. It appeared throughout the Fall collection paired with sleeveless blouses and men’s suits for women. If the <em>losange</em> offered a taste of luxury, Margiela’s reverse kidskin “portés par deux” (layered double coats) delivered it in a great dollop. The icing on top? Matching cross-body muff bags.</p></div>"
50,fall,2001,f2001,icarius-de-menezes,"At 25, Brazilian designer Icarius de Menezes clearly has a talent for precise cutting, which is already obvious in both his flouncy, asymmetric gowns and sharp tailoring. After his debut Paris collection alluding to the gaudy excess of beauty pageants, de Menezes whipped up a heady combination of references for Fall: Fitted white coats and bomber jackets were livened up with a red armband or a dangling streamer; body-hugging jeans and bondage-inspired trousers stood in sharp contrast to his woolly gray suits and quasi-monastic, ethereal capes. Prints on smart blouses and dresses included everything from Hermès-like motifs to magazine images and iconic drawings. Icarius graduated from Brazil's increasingly important Santa Marcelina fashion school and briefly worked at <em>Brazilian Vogue</em> before decamping to the City of Light. ""São Paulo is becoming very important in terms of design,"" he says. ""But my big opportunity, for the moment, is in Paris.""</p></div>"
51,fall,2001,f2001,imitation-of-christ,"After a long day of back-to-back shows, the fashion flock trekked uptown to the Clearview Theaters on 66th Street, where Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, known as Imitation of Christ, showed their second collection, yet again full of spruced-up secondhand clothes, this time with a focus on archly flashy eveningwear.</p><p>How could they possibly follow up last season's funeral-parlor presentation? With a faux movie premiere. After being asked to make a charity donation to Sweatshop Watch and Free the Children, guests took their seats and watched live footage of models arriving to the theater for an imaginary premiere dressed as prom queens, party girls, giddy starlets, slinky old-school divas, '30s flappers and '80s good-time girls. After the good-time girls settled in the front rows, Subkoff and Damhave showed a short movie depicting the trials and tribulations of L.A.'s gilded youth (with a bit of philosophy and a suicide thrown in for good measure), featuring appearances by Élodie Bouchez, Reese Witherspoon, and Selma Blair. In a small corner of the screen, a documentary about the harsh working conditions in Central American free-trade zones was simultaneously presented.</p><p>What of the clothes, you ask? In Imitation of Christ's world, the question seems to be rather irrelevant.</p></div>"
52,fall,2001,f2001,jean-paul-gaultier,"The invitation to Jean Paul Gaultier's show offered the first clue of what was in store: It was a puzzle that crumbled in your hands as you opened the envelope.</p><p>The moment a soundtrack of cut-and-paste snippets of famous Prince tracks blared and two girls in slashed outfits hit the runway simultaneously, it all became clear: Gaultier was embracing bricollage.</p><p>Three-piece suits took on a whole new meaning on his runway. The bottom halves of jackets were hacked off and worn as miniskirts over matching trousers; detachable sleeves hung precariously by little fastenings at the shoulder. Not one to hold back, Gaultier unceremoniously relieved plush fur coats of their entire backsides; long evening gowns were also snipped, turning them into glamorous tank top-and-skirt combos. For those fearful of do-it-yourself endeavors, there were a couple of aged leather coats, plenty of sharp trousers and a substantial array of <em>Purple Rain</em> skirts and tops.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6xws6m""></div></div><p>""The idea was to make clothes that can be made as you want,"" exclaimed an exultant Gaultier after the show, in his distinctive brand of English.

53,fall,2001,f2001,jeremy-scott,"Forget about long, drawn-out conceptualism. In less than 10 minutes, Jeremy Scott managed to not only condense his entire aesthetic into one extravagant performance, but also to send an entire room of jaded editors into a collective roar of laughter.</p><p>When the curtains of Paris' Cirque d'Hiver were drawn, they revealed a revolving floor of glamorous TV game-show winners, done up to the nines in billowing dollar-bill outfits, plush logo-embossed furs, fitted designer jeans, sequined jumpsuits and zip-up jogging ensembles. The rouge-laden, important-haired celebutantes proudly displayed their hard-earned treasures: a stationary bicycle, a comfy reclining chair, a fabulous piano and, in the case of a less fortunate darling, a humble blender.</p><p>When the show ended, a second set of curtains opened and Scott, perched upon a fluffy cloud that would've made Jeff Koons proud, shared his wealth of mock $10,000 bills and chocolate gold coins with the audience—just like any bleach-blond, mullet-coiffed, modern-day Bob Barker would.</p></div>"
54,fall,2001,f2001,jil-sander,"After being made to stand in a huddle for over half an hour in the freezing Milanese drizzle, frazzled editors were finally squeezed through a wall of thuggish security guards and into the Jil Sander showroom.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wait was not particularly rewarding: Without its founding designer, Jil Sander has not yet managed to find its stride. Austere overcoats, blazers and sheath dresses blended together in a parade of black; a series of sheared fur jackets, burgundy velvet blazers and billowy trousers tucked into mannish boots could not alleviate the monotony. While there were a few smart dresses and all-purpose coats in the mix, it is clear that what Jil Sander the label misses desperately is, quite simply, Jil Sander the designer.</p></div>"
55,fall,2001,f2001,john-galliano,"John Galliano is certainly in great form this season, and we're not talking about his newly buff physique. After his triumphant Dior tour de force, Galliano showed an inventive, sophisticated and—dare we say it?—wearable collection for his signature label.</p><p>It all started with sporty elastic-waist plaid tracksuits and billowing blousons, superwide denim trousers, cargo pants and a sensational cropped, hooded puffy jacket. Things quickly moved along with warrior-princess dresses, massive army-green skirts with red detailing and ecru coats with floral cutout patterns. Galliano then allowed himself a series of precious soft-chiffon dresses with old English floral prints that called for a perfect cup of tea—and for fabulous flat boots that could've been made with the skin of a prehistoric reptile.</p><p>This season, Galliano has channeled his considerable creative energies into focused clothes that don't just stand out from the pack—they also work in the real world.</p></div>"
56,fall,2001,f2001,julien-macdonald,"With his gold cursive initials boldly hung over red curtains in the nouveau-posh party salon of London's Le Meridien Grosvenor House Hotel, Julien Macdonald let loose an unabashed display of fashion excess at its best, or worst, depending on one's point of view.</p><p>There's absolutely nothing subtle about Macdonald's rich-bitch aesthetic: Picture an avalanche of massive furs, leopard-printed, sexed-up vamp dresses with S&amp;M caps, dominatrix-inspired leather suits, sky-high diamond heels and sequined blazers that would make Ivana Trump look positively frumpy. As if to drive his point home, Macdonald also showed lavishly embroidered matador suits and a series of barely-there lingerie gowns that could've been plucked from a racier version of the Victoria's Secret catalog.</p><p>Did it work? Absolutely. Macdonald's clothes are clearly not for everyone (Pamela Anderson and Miss Venezuela come to mind as potential customers), but the over-the-top performance was a jolt of pure fun.</p></div>"
57,fall,2001,f2001,katayone-adeli,"For the last couple of years, Katayone Adeli has been quietly cultivating a devoted following of in-the-know girls who cherish her super-slim pants and trendy tops, so it was no surprise to find Christy Turlington and Famke Janssen avidly checking off looks on their programs as the show progressed.</p><p>Adeli has successfully tapped into the need for clothes that retain an air of romantic sensuality but are imbued with a street-smart edge. In her hands, a train on an indigo-blue dress becomes a chic accessory that can be toyed with while sipping a martini, then pinned to the waist when it's time to face reality and fetch a taxi. Her leather jackets are paneled and sliced, creating an effect that's both tough and delicate; pencil skirts are ruched at the seams and paired with lacy shirts with turquoise sequin details half-hidden at the shoulder. Adeli is proving that she has some savvy tricks up her sleeve, reworking traditional notions of femininity into sexy, functional looks that are relevant to a young, urban generation of women.</p></div>"
58,fall,2001,f2001,kenzo,"""Romantic rock"" was Gilles Rosier's point of reference for Kenzo's exploration of hard-edged, dramatic silhouettes.</p><p>Rosier distilled many of the prevailing trends of the season and assembled them in a pastiche of brooding suits, pegged trousers, pleated and voluminous skirts, drop-waist jackets and flat-ankle booties.</p><p>Acknowledging the house's tradition of mixing and matching ethnic references, Rosier also showed a series of Middle Eastern-inspired prints and dainty floral appliqués that at times got lost in the mix. While several individual pieces will work fine on their own, the collection failed to create a lasting impression. The Kenzo label still has ground to cover in order to develop a strong and relevant image for today.</p></div>"
59,fall,2001,f2001,krizia-top,"Seeking to modernize their company and create a more fashion-forward image, Krizia hired Belgian designer Jean-Paul Knott. Knott, who took the reins of Krizia's most upscale line from Alber Elbaz, had previously worked for over a decade with Yves Saint Laurent.</p><p>Knott succeeded in putting Krizia Top on the map with a modern, sometimes overly enthusiastic aesthetic. Off-the-shoulder oversize sweaters, tight leather skirts, satin shirtdresses and plunging-neck chemises all oozed sexiness. Long rubber stockings tiptoed the fetishistic line, but provided a happy solution for those who crave open-toe mules and miniskirts in the dead of winter. Knott also indulged in a few skirts with a massive side buckle, which consisted essentially of fabric drawn through a giant square and then draped around the hips. More classically chic options included an impeccable camel coat, several sharp pantsuits and a series of matte sequin dresses that looked absolutely elegant and modern without trying too hard.</p></div>"
60,fall,2001,f2001,lanvin,"Cristina Ortiz went for a tougher-than-usual feeling at Lanvin, restricting her palette to black, navy blue and off-white.</p><p>To a rock-and-roll soundtrack, Ortiz sent out long coats with half-hidden belts, low-button mannish jackets, teensy black dresses with side slits and blazers with upturned, silver-studded lapels. Ortiz was intent on making a statement with sheer fabrics, unexpected cutouts and dramatic details like neck bands that trailed down the arm and reattached themselves at the cuff.</p><p>Her experiments often worked well. A petrol-blue trench was striking, and several minidresses looked sharp and sexy. On the other hand, some of Ortiz's slashed tops and self-consciously punky looks seemed a bit forced and contrived. The clean, simple silhouettes worked best.</p></div>"
61,fall,2001,f2001,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele clearly feels right at home in a season dominated by chromatic extremes; his no-frills collection was done almost exclusively in black and white. But that's not to say that it was all about bare-bones minimalism—instead, Steele played up a naive, if somewhat perverse, girl-wants-to-be-a-grown-up look.</p><p>How else to explain black, above-the-knee pleated leather skirts with a white-trimmed sailor top, Girl Scout foulards over liquid minisheaths and Empire-waist playground dresses with gathered short sleeves? Delicate ribbons trimmed fitted pullovers, Bermuda shorts loosened up severe blazers and pearl buttons adorned classic pea coats.</p><p>Steele's only concession to color came in the form of a couple of gently ruffled, sheer off-the-shoulder tops worn with black-velvet skirts, black stockings and patent double-bow Mary Janes. Add a plush black fur and you're ready to go—after all, even the nicest girls need a bit of mischief sometimes.</p></div>"
62,fall,2001,f2001,loewe,"Narciso Rodriguez took his final bow as Loewe's designer today in order to concentrate on his newly revamped signature line.</p><p>Rodriguez waved <em>adios</em> to the Spanish luxury-leather house with plenty of the strong, graphic—and saleable—clothes with which he put the label on the fashion map. There was nothing superfluous about his brief, to-the-point collection, executed in black, white and silver. Fitted leather shells toughened up flimsy georgette slip-skirts; wrap jackets and gabardine coats were tightly bound at the waist; a couple of leather coats flirted with an Empire silhouette. Metal-studded shifts looked feminine and chic rather than punky.</p><p>Rodriguez closed his show with absolutely clean white jersey-and-crepe evening skirts, flyaway tops and a couple of sequin dresses that would put a giant disco ball to shame.</p></div>"
63,fall,2001,f2001,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs delivered yet another impeccable collection for Louis Vuitton today, once again raising the ante for designers in Paris.</p><p>Jacobs acknowledged the predominantly black, moody aesthetic that has been so prevalent this season but gave it a sophisticated, playful spin that was nothing short of joyful. His felted cavalry twill coats and suits were hard and sexy—but also sweet, thanks to puffs of mink that served as buttons. Jacobs' silk jersey Empire dresses were miles ahead of the pack, relying solely on modest polka dots and precise cut for effect. His denim jeans with tiny gold zipper pulls at the pockets will bring quiet luxury to the street. Tone-on-tone plaid dresses and efficient little robes with colorful optic insets referenced mod classics but felt absolutely fresh and original.</p><p>Evening was also impeccable. Mink pom-pom T-shirts were effortlessly chic; velvet dresses and translucent silk jersey tunics were simultaneously cool and grown-up, especially when worn with high cordovan side-lace boots that are sure to become one of Fall's must-have accessories.</p></div>"

Channeling early ’70s English street style, Bartley showed tiny denim dungaree dresses, drainpipe jeans, frayed miniskirts and oversize men’s jackets. Striped shirts with matching ties, mohair duffle coats and massive bombers in suede and sheepskin showed that skinheads can appreciate a bit of luxury as much as anyone else. Accessories included massive denim patent-strap bags; all looks were shown with classic Dr. Martens combat boots.</p><p>Bartley may not be at the forefront of innovation, but her well thought-out, carefully planned collection scored plenty of hits and provided a strong conclusion to a sometimes dreary Milanese fashion calendar.</p></div>"
65,fall,2001,f2001,maison-martin-margiela,"Forget rose petals. For his Fall ’01 show, Margiela chose a location in a tunnel under Paris’s Pont Alexandre III. Models wore rock tees, thigh-high boots, silken men’s robes, and fringed dresses. It was one of his most street-inflected collections ever.</p></div>"
66,fall,2001,f2001,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs is on a roll. A mere 18 hours after presenting his sophisticated and mature signature collection, the globe-trotting designer went for lightning-speed street smarts at Marc—and it worked like a charm.</p><p>Wallflowers, beware: To a blaring soundtrack by the Cure, Jacobs' girls stormed the runway wearing super-tight, faded and striped jeans, fitted military overcoats, graffiti-printed sweats and T-shirts, flocked miniskirts and no-nonsense olive parkas.</p><p>It's the kind of look that has made headlines in London for the last few seasons, but Jacobs added preppy elements to the mix, like varsity bomber jackets, rugby shirts, skinny ties and corduroy jackets, all layered haphazardly. Even the girliest clothes—cherry-print ruffle skirts, wool felt school blazers and a floral peplum dress—looked modern and tough when worn with triple-layered elastic belts and chunky ankle booties.</p></div>"
67,fall,2001,f2001,marc-jacobs,"Gone were all of Spring’s campy, sugar-coated references to the clubby ’80s at Marc Jacobs. In their stead, Jacobs went for quirkily tailored clothes that gently touched upon—and promptly subverted—fashion’s recurring ladylike motifs with playful details and an unforced spirit of innocence.</p><p>With a knowing wink to Patrick Kelly, that other famous American Francophile, Jacobs gave a lively twist to his boiled-twill suits, silk jackets, and cashmere coats using oversized, childlike buttons. The effect was that of a young girl trying on her older sister’s clothes, yet somehow making them all her own. Colorful trompe l’oeil lapels, ribbons, collars, and trims on simple georgette tops and dresses all added to the general feeling of naive elegance. With bunny-and-flower-print dresses and a stunning yellow mohair and sequin coat, Jacobs provided welcome relief from the self-consciously glammed-up evening looks that dominate most runways.</p></div>"
68,fall,2001,f2001,marjan-pejoski,"In an increasingly corporate fashion climate, Marjan Pejoski seems to be intent on just having fun. This season he turned his rose-strewn runway into a dramatic fashion aviary.</p><p>Pejoski's clothes are not exactly everyday basics—unless your idea of a go-anywhere look is a pair of fur hot pants, high boots and a bat-sleeved, wide-knit sweater with a gigantic beaded peacock appliqué. Other options included a giant net top with dangling trompe l'oeil plumage, and a bodysuit embellished with a feathery creature whose generous wingspan somehow failed to conceal the wearer's breasts. How to top off the madness? Consider an ostrichlike creation with a long neck and head that needed to be constantly held up, or Pejoski's closing outfit, which literally turned Alek Wek into a dazzling swan.</p></div>"
69,fall,2001,f2001,markus-lupfer,"Combining the best of Britain's creative energy with a self-assured sense of control, Markus Lupfer is fast becoming one of London's most important designers.</p><p>Relying on precise tailoring and a stunning sense of color, Lupfer brought to life classic wardrobe staples and gave them a modern, subtly edgy twist. Simple turtlenecks and crewnecks in primary yellow, red and blue looked fresh and youthful with ribbon-front, pleated and layered skirts; masculine jackets were softened with draped lapels then paired with flat-front trousers; cocktail dresses relied only on a slight side cinch for a shot of swagger. Lupfer's fitted corduroy jeans and body-conscious bomber jackets were full of attitude, but his shiny, printed shift dresses looked sweet and elegant. Accessories included bright, see-through plastic belts that neatly tied together his structured looks.</p></div>"
70,fall,2001,f2001,marni,"In a season marked by an absence of color, Marni designer Consuelo Castiglione bucked the all-black trend and delivered the type of sentimental yet modern clothes that will provide a welcome alternative for women who crave a romantic touch.</p><p>There was nothing heavy about Castiglione's papery dresses with loose ties, embroidered wrap skirts and flower-appliqué coats. Instead of the tight, vampy miniskirts that have taken over many runways, Castiglione showed flowing A-lines with pretty marigold prints, boxy and comfortable jackets with colorful square patterns, and lightweight, comfortable V-neck sweaters. Contrasting leather sashes, dark stockings and large circular totes worked wonderfully, though the Japanese-inspired wooden shoes Castiglione used may not be for everyone. For evening there were antique-looking dresses with distressed straps, beaded inlays and multiple see-through layers, as well as a striking champagne skirt.</p></div>"
71,fall,2001,f2001,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon's opening looks—a long, dark, loose overcoat thrown over straight pants, a military jacket and a wrap skirt with a sexy corset—announced that we were in for another rendition of the masculine/feminine play of opposites that has been so prevalent this season.</p><p>Sitbon did it well. Leather skirts with lace insets on the side, pert blazers with puffed shoulders, and safari jackets with patch pockets will be functional and eye-catching additions to any wardrobe. Dresses with spider-web embroideries, distressed sides, and tulle and paillette layers were simultaneously flirty and stone-hard. Less interesting were the red-and-black printed cocktail numbers (which came and went without leaving a lasting impression) and the overly revealing lingerie slips.</p><p>Still, as a whole, Sitbon's collection offered plenty of strong clothes that are perfectly practical yet manage to stand out from the pack.</p></div>"
72,fall,2001,f2001,matthew-williamson,"""Wonderland"" was the working title for Matthew Williamson's whirlpool of rainbow sequins, lace, mesh and fur.</p><p>Contrary to fashion's current mood of pared-down chic, Williamson showed a large selection of paillette-encrusted skirts, tops with glittery messages such as ""Drink Me,"" ruched gold clam-diggers, and cropped sweatshirts and miniskirts with shiny embroidered playing cards. There were also puzzling Playboy bunny-like leather aprons, miniature furs, ravaged tulle skirts, Jackson Pollock-inspired paint-splattered dresses, and a couple of red coats with a ladylike bow that looked lost amidst the sea of over-the-top decoration. Some of Williamson's pieces will add a whimsical and extravagant touch to staid wardrobes, but as a whole the collection seemed oddly out of sync with the fashion moment.</p></div>"
73,fall,2001,f2001,michael-kors-collection,"After Michael Kors' bold take on country luxe, there's little doubt that equestrian chic will be a recurring theme next Fall. Kors may have been inspired by life on the farm, but there was nothing rough-edged or dowdy about his thoroughbred looks. Riding britches were turned into lean, mean trousers that could be tucked into tall leather boots or worn with double-buckle boyish shoes; cashmere Aran sweaters and bright marigold, kelly green and scarlet turtlenecks looked divine under sinful, double-faced blanket coats to the floor.</p><p>Kors kept his collection sharply in focus by consistently emphasizing contrasts: Dramatic capes flowed over skinny jodhpurs and mini-shifts while crisp, colorful piping gave an architectural edge to everything from quilted field skirts to practical leather jackets. The recurring play of opposites was especially successful with the evening looks: A long, beaded bronze lace skirt looked perfect with a casual turtleneck and sporty suede jacket; an ivory sweater coat unceremoniously framed a shimmering evening gown.</p><p>It takes considerable talent and experience to pull off such a collection without stumbling onto a minefield of overworked references. It's no coincidence that this Fall marks Michael Kors' 20th anniversary of designing casual yet utterly luxurious clothes.</p></div>"
74,fall,2001,f2001,miguel-adrover,"When most people travel abroad they bring back pictures, postcards, and perhaps a trinket or two from the local tourist traps. Miguel Adrover and his creative director, Sebastian Pons, spent six weeks in Egypt, lived with a family in the countryside for 24 days, and returned to New York with enough inspiration for a full-fledged Middle Eastern collection.</p><p>Adrover’s Egyptian jaunt, which was staged in an incense-drenched market-turned-tent, included everything from floor-length caftans and coats worn with turbans and chadors to blazers with harem pants and jodhpurs, layered printed tunics and jet-black robes. Adrover also sent out several nomads carrying large packages on their heads, strict military cadets, colonial-era emissaries, and a shepherdess who was left sans sheep when the fluffy creature refused to take to the runway.</p><p>Some may argue that few women will want to wear endless layers of earth-sweeping gowns for everyday life. But it’s a pleasure to confirm that fashion is not always just about stilettos and tarty see-through tops. Those who absolutely insist on practicality can simply pass on Adrover’s more fanciful looks and concentrate on the chic trousers, smart skirts, plaid jackets and ruffled dresses that will work perfectly well in any cosmopolitan environment.</p></div>"
75,fall,2001,f2001,missoni,"Perhaps taking a cue from last season's obsession with corseted, wrapped and strapped silhouettes, Missoni toyed with a more overtly adventurous feeling than usual this season, with decidedly mixed results.</p><p>The house's well-known staples were all there: Roomy tweed trousers, long zig-zag print coats and colorful turtlenecks all looked great, as did a pale-blue corduroy pantsuit and a floor-grazing trench. Patchwork-inlaid coats, jackets and skirts added a playful spin to Missoni's traditional play of patterns. Less successful were the whalebone-cinched tops, strappy optic dresses and oversize patent-leather trousers; and the intriguing double bag designed to dangle perilously over the shoulder is a pickpocket's dream come true.</p><p>What worked best at Missoni were the looks that relied on classic design and well-assembled colors and textures for effect.</p></div>"
76,fall,2001,f2001,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada reworked at Miu Miu many of the themes she presented in her signature collection, giving them a light-hearted, dreamy feeling.</p><p>The countercultural, '50s-inspired girls of last season have now moved on to the '60s, and are wearing sheer lingerie slips, sleeveless wool shifts, short capes with front pockets and double-breasted boiled-wool minicoats. Like their more mature cousins at Prada, Miu Miu enthusiasts love black—but they can also add plenty of color to their mod look with flower-printed robes and little Empire-waisted dresses in bright green and red. Sharp denim jackets, pleated skirts and straight jeans work perfectly with crinkly cotton shirts as a hip city uniform.</p><p>Miu Miu's accessories always tie the looks together. In this case, black stockings, cracked-leather Mary Janes and low-slung tan bags all looked polished yet slightly worn—as if a fashion-savvy gamine had rifled through her mother's closet, borrowing all the right stuff.</p></div>"
77,fall,2001,f2001,moschino,"One can always count on Moschino for a good romp; playing up stereotypes with sarcastic humor is one of the label's signature touches. From the moment a sexy chambermaid stepped onto the catwalk bearing a bottle of wine and wearing an apron and a dress that said ""Maid in Italy,"" it was clear that this was no ordinary show.</p><p>A troupe of sleepy, fresh-out-of-bed housewives followed—wearing pajamalike satin camisole dresses, a pink fur bathroom robe, hair curlers and sleeping masks. Once dressed, our friends proved to be everything from gingham-clad cleaning ladies, to flower-drenched good girls, to on-the-go businesswomen. What followed was a play on fashion's current obsession with masculine and feminine roles: Girls dressed up as schoolboys, and gangsters and military cadets all turned up with their belles in tow.</p><p>There were no major fashion revelations, but Moschino provided an hour of kitschy fun that offered relief from the overly serious and self-conscious mood that has dominated the week.</p></div>"
78,fall,2001,f2001,narciso-rodriguez,"Anyone who has felt New York fashion week needed a shot of fresh energy will be glad to know that Narciso Rodriguez is back to stay after his extended Milanese stint.</p><p>Rodriguez showed one of his strongest collections in seasons, relying on deft tailoring, clean lines and meticulous attention to detail. A double-layered cotton and wool shift hugged the body and offered a peek-a-boo hint of red piping at the seams; tuxedo trousers were paired with a layered T-shirt, limpid button-down and stretch-wool jumper, all with the sleeves hacked off. A red fox coat appeared sumptuous and rich, yet faintly savage—think of the look as tough chic.</p><p>Rodriguez’s evening dresses hinted at the loose, light silhouette of the 1920s, but there was nothing retro about his dangling chains and Swarovski crystals, metallic belts and stretch wool overlays. With his short, highly focused collection, Rodriguez proved that a few well-executed ideas are far more compelling and newsworthy than predictable gimmicks and flash-in-the-pan trends.</p></div>"
79,fall,2001,f2001,olivier-theyskens,"As if to prove once and for all that he is up to the task of designing for Givenchy or any other major fashion house, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/olivier-theyskens"">Olivier Theyskens</a> presented what was undoubtedly one of the strongest, most brilliant collections of the season.</p><p>With an unerring sense of proportion and color, the Belgian designer showed massive coats that folded upon themselves to become a skirt. A gigantic violet pouf was worn with a wide-knit black cardigan. His all-in-one tweed skirt-and-coat combo was a veritable feat of engineering. Theyskens’ poetic experiments did not end there: Knit fur jackets were backed with colorful linings to match their metallic buttons; an imperious strapless white dress came with a fur inset and a sweeping train.</p><p>Theyskens lightened his presentation with boxy black suits, skinny white trousers and little mint-julep dresses, proving that he can also create impeccable clothes for everyday life.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""uc377r""></div></div><p>What else could he possibly show in under 20 minutes? How about sexy, shiny underwear that’s far too fabulous to be worn in private, or sculptured heels with a coy bump in the back? Clearly, Theyskens is anything but short of ideas.</p></div>"
80,fall,2001,f2001,oscar-de-la-renta,"With a palette centered mainly around black and white, Oscar de la Renta offered a more somber take than usual on his frothy classics, but still provided a wide range of stylistic options for his faithful clientele.</p><p>For lunch at Swifty's, there were salt-and-pepper tweed suits, gently flared skirts to the knee, and wool coats with fur collars and prim leather bow belts. De la Renta's vision of casual luxury also included cashmere and boiled wool cardigan jackets, ruffled silk charmeuse blouses and even a sexy, youthful fuchsia shearling mini. Evening took a turn for the dramatic with beaded and feathered slipdresses, tapestry-print velvet trousers and gowns, and a couple of decidedly gothic black opera coats. Some of these looks will prove overwhelming for many, but steadfast Oscar fans will still be able to find plenty of their favorite ruffled skirts and sexy halter tops.</p><p>Shoe and bag fetishists will be delighted to know that de la Renta launched his signature line of accessories this season, including diamond-buckled pumps, satin slingbacks, embroidered boots and hard-frame crocodile cases.</p></div>"
81,fall,2001,f2001,pierrot,"Sometimes it takes an outsider's eye to appreciate the nuances of America. After designing Miguel Adrover's knitwear for two seasons (who can forget the breathtaking spider-web shawls?), Frenchman Pierrot has brought a Midwest backwoods aesthetic to his runway.</p><p>Inspired by his frequent visits to rural Michigan, Pierrot (né Pierre Carrilero) designed an all-knit collection that includes camouflaged hunting bodysuits, coats with dangling furry tails, a sweater that reads ""The Right to Bear Arms,"" and several Native-American-inspired ensembles. Not one to skimp on details, Pierrot also covered his New York runway with autumn leaves, interspersed a rubber animal or two among the models, and provided a stunning photo-panel forest backdrop.</p><p>In contrast to the sometimes predictable and commercially oriented Bryant Park collections, Pierrot's performance stood out as one of the truly enjoyable and original highlights of fashion week.</p></div>"
82,fall,2001,f2001,prada,"The hard-edged, almost austere look that Miuccia Prada recently championed has clearly become a major influence this season, so it's not surprising that her Fall collection continued to push forth a no-nonsense, pared-down aesthetic.</p><p>Working almost exclusively in dark gray, black and brown, Prada reworked some of the looks that first made Carnaby Street chic. Fur-trimmed, paneled coats with geometric fastenings worn over skintight leggings brought to mind a nouvelle Twiggy, as did the coquettish minidresses with bright orange trim. Steering clear of superficial connotations, Prada made sure to keep her collection varied. For every mod shift there was a long, pleated skirt, a flowing Empire-waist prairie robe or a smart capelet. A couple of copper-and-white swirl dresses, a plush everyday fur and several impeccable jackets spoke of understated cool, as did her all-important accessories. Patent Mary Janes and tall lace-up granny boots were worn with thick stockings, while enormous tan bags with extra-long straps swung nonchalantly at the hip.</p><p>By veering away from excessive decoration and facile status references, Prada succeeded in creating a perfectly fashionable anti-fashion wardrobe.</p></div>"
83,fall,2001,f2001,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"""Why is it all these girls look so soft and I look so hard?"" asked a voice-over on Preen's runway soundtrack. The rhetorical question was a perfect allusion to Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi's deftly manipulated collection.</p><p>Preen's clothes are clearly meant to stand out: Slouch tweed pants were paired with windowpane button-downs with gathered or ballooned sleeves creating the top-heavy silhouette that remained a constant throughout the collection. Thornton and Bregazzi are known for their way with hides, and this time around they went for cream leather asymmetric skirts with button-encrusted sashes; a suede jacket was generously ruffled at the side, while trousers were cut perilously low; a series of cropped fur tops brought to mind a defiantly chic cave woman. As if all this wasn't enough to make quite a statement, Preen's embellishments included dangling beaded lace appliqué's, jangles of rosaries, stitched-on buttons, and giant rosettes that trailed in the back of skirts.</p></div>"
84,fall,2001,f2001,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren tapped into fashion's current need for simplicity, referencing equestrian uniforms and making them relevant for modern urban life.</p><p>Lauren's fine-gauge cashmere turtlenecks, lush cable sweaters, cavalry twill pants, textured crocodile belts and plaid jackets with leather elbow patches will work perfectly for a casual lunch date or a weekend getaway to Greenwich, Conn. Supple espresso leather shirtdresses, fitted chocolate suede pants and generously ruffled shirts also looked practical and smart, as did the short, easygoing georgette cocktail slips lavished with beaded paisleys.</p><p>For evening, Lauren segued into long, rich velvet skirts and floor-length strapless gowns, but the real show-stoppers were a series of tuxedos that could be worn with an ivory silk shirt, a short string of diamonds, or nothing at all. As Lauren stated in his show program: ""It's thoroughbred dressing at its newest and most chic.""</p></div>"
85,fall,2001,f2001,richard-edwards,"Women who secretly raided their boyfriends' wardrobes in search of sharp-cut Richard Edwards trousers and blazers will be delighted to know that the duo have debuted a womenswear line for Fall 2001. Clean lines and an all-American feel are still the design mantra for Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick, who first teamed up in 1995 to create a small but effective line of men's clothes.</p><p>Sleek pencil skirts and trousers were worn with asymmetric wrap shirts, impeccable jackets and gathered-front turtlenecks; leather tops with ruched waistbands looked strong and sexy. Subtle details like gently gathered lapels that created a foulard-like effect on classic coats gave the collection a touch of whimsy and saved it from straying toward the conventional. Easygoing pleated dresses, an assortment of shiny knockout suits and several fabulous tomato ensembles promise that Richard Edwards will make quite a splash with Manhattan's no-nonsense power-dressers.</p></div>"
86,fall,2001,f2001,richard-tyler,"Guests were unceremoniously squeezed into a packed glass hothouse in New York's West Village for Richard Tyler's presentation of attention-grabbing couture.</p><p>Tyler's considerable tailoring skills were most apparent on a sculpted leather blazer with pointed shoulders, a pearl crepe coat with a pleated side panel, and a mannish sharkskin suit worn with a shiny button-down and matching tie. Short, pintucked empire-waist slips kept the mood light, proving that evening dressing is not always synonymous with floor-length.</p><p>While Tyler's chiffon strapless gowns, distressed embroideries and playful fringes brought to mind the carefree silhouette of the '20s, at times his enthusiasm took a turn for the excessive. A final parade of corseted dresses, deconstructed tuxedos and skimpy teddies would have made quite a splash at a Playboy mansion reception.</p></div>"
87,fall,2001,f2001,roberto-cavalli,"So much for minimalism! To say that Roberto Cavalli's show was over the top is a moot point; the designer has built his reputation precisely around his larger-than-life point of view.</p><p>The Victorian Age and Aspen in the '60s were the abstract sources of inspiration for Cavalli's pelts-and-plumage fest, which included enormous shearlings, lush lynxes and imposing feather chokers. Cavalli took a break from his hunting extravaganza with equally lavish, ravaged tapestry ensembles, beaded acid-wash denim, deer-and-eagle-printed dresses and several fitted pantsuits.</p><p>Who exactly will wear Cavalli's ode to excess? Lil' Kim and friends are a good start—but as the designer emerged from backstage, pipe in hand, for his lengthy bow, he was surrounded by a procession of girls in skimpy, somewhat more accessible versions of his outrageous dresses. Still, proceed with caution.</p></div>"
88,fall,2001,f2001,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret can always be counted on for plenty of old-school sex appeal; he can turn a few yards of fabric into a show-stopping, ultra-sexy cocktail dress with just a pinch and a tuck.</p><p>In keeping with his reputation, Mouret showed plenty of dramatic, body-skimming tops held together by nothing more than a leather rosette; goddess dresses were suspended by only a piece of glittery adhesive tape. If you can't quite picture yourself taking the subway at rush hour wearing a satin handkerchief, you'll be glad to know that there were also sensible fitted jeans and skirts with leather inlays, and a couple of tuxedolike suits and jackets.</p><p>In a world of increasingly homogenous dressing, Mouret has clearly carved out a distinctive niche for himself. Still, one wishes he would explore new territory—at times his collection was simply repetitive, and it didn't help matters that many pieces were embellished with the same glitter-trimmed holes as last season.</p></div>"
89,fall,2001,f2001,ruffo-research,"Once again Ruffo Research managed to inject a powerful dose of street smarts into an otherwise conventional Milanese fashion week.</p><p>Sophia Kokosalaki’s second and final collection for the well-known leather house gave a lesson in strong femininity. Chocolate-suede dresses edged in black leather looked simultaneously sweet and deathly cool; savage-looking braided straps, odd bits of tulle and featherlike tufts of goat skin gave a primitive edge to perfectly cut tops. But Kokosalaki also proved that she can go for classic design—with an edge, of course. Her long leather coat stands out miles from the pack thanks to a simple diagonal row of buttons; a black leather blazer is decorated with a trompe-l'oeil lapel trim, and a sharp skirt reveals a teardrop of skin at the hips. Kokosalaki also scored a hit with several divine sheared shearling coats that put the softest of furs to shame.</p><p>With its sharp eye for recognizing and nurturing new talent, Ruffo Research is proving to be not only a powerful innovator in Italian fashion, but also a key label for insiders.</p></div>"
90,fall,2001,f2001,russell-sage,"""I need money!"" said Russell Sage to his sponsor, the bank Britannic Money, who generously obliged with 10,000 pounds. The designer promptly stitched the bills into stunning rosettes on a skirt, jacket and dress. ""It's a way to comment on the economic struggles that many designers face, and also make a statement about the value of fashion,"" said Sage. ""One of my dresses is made out of 6,000 pounds. But is it worth more than that?""</p><p>We certainly think so. Sage's collection played out brilliantly, turning not only bank notes but recovered antique fabrics and even a common blanket into modern, off-kilter wonders. Linen jackets came with hand-painted details, lace insets peeked out of shirts, and a damask tablecloth became a skirt; think of it as Portobello Market chic. Sage believes that each and every one of his pieces has an important history behind it, which the buyer can make his own. As if to prove his point, he closed the show with a striking, delicately beaded white dress made out of his own mother's wedding gown, which Sage brought back to life after it had been stored for over 40 years.</p></div>"
91,fall,2001,f2001,saint-laurent,"Working almost exclusively in black, Tom Ford took confident steps toward defining his vision for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche.</p><p>A couple of pink-and-amethyst short dresses trimmed in waffle pleats opened the show; from that moment on, Ford's only concession to color was a deep aubergine tone that surfaced sporadically.</p><p>The monochromatic scheme forced the audience to focus on the design of the clothes. Saint Laurent's famous gypsies migrated to the new millennium, their fringed skirts and off-the-shoulder peasant dresses intact but updated for urban life. Ford also provided an impressive array of fitted jackets with ruffled lapels, leader-of-the-band coats, sumptuous shearlings and stern military overcoats with epaulettes and thick belts.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gmonww""></div></div><p>The precise focus of Ford's collection extended to the accessories: The new YSL Rive Gauche thick-heeled, wide-strap heels, no-nonsense boots and graphic rectangular cases should be flying off the shelves next fall.</p></div>"
92,fall,2001,f2001,shelley-fox,"Shelley Fox has clearly understood that a strong silhouette can speak far louder than the self-consciously dramatic statements that overeager young designers sometimes feel compelled to make.</p><p>Fox's collection revolved around full-cut skirts worn over tulle layers, strict jackets with unexpected volumes and off-kilter dresses. Matte leather skirts were done in strong, graphic colors and paired with simple black tops; a shift dress, utterly devoid of embellishments, had one of its straps snapped in two; a copper top was fitted to the body, its ballooned sleeves slit at the side. Fox also showed a series of chunky knits and pale sweaters that carried through her message of relaxed, casual chic.</p></div>"
93,fall,2001,f2001,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel occupies her own fabulous fashion universe, which at times casually overlaps with the one in which the majority of mortals reside.</p><p>For fall, Rykiel's world is made up of pegged shiny trousers and colorful sweaters decorated with rhinestone trims, beaded fruit motifs and glittery messages like ""temptation."" Gold zippers crisscross otherwise conventional wool blazers, and short jersey dresses reveal geometric panels of skin through graphic cutouts. Rykiel's fox and raccoon chubby coats most closely resemble a wearable cloud dyed violet, yellow or rust—and they look sensational.</p><p>Naturally, her eveningwear couldn't possibly make less of a statement: Transparent lace cardigans and skirts with knit trims, frilly polka-dotted frocks and asymmetric pearl satin dresses evoke found treasures from a madcap vintage store.</p></div>"
94,fall,2001,f2001,sophia-kokosalaki,"Greek-born Sophia Kokosalaki left little doubt that she is here to stay as one of London's most promising young designers.</p><p>Kokosalaki continued to refine many of her signature themes—dresses and tops were painstakingly pleated and draped, then bound with leather bands and grommet straps to create a look that is both classically feminine and unflinchingly hard-core. But the big news in her Fall collection was the more austere tuxedo suits, straight trousers, piped overcoats and straight skirts, which relied only on precision of cut and subtle details like tone-on-tone piping for effect.</p><p>Subtle mixes of olive, tan and brown referenced military uniforms; a series of salmon, red and black dresses showed that, with only a few collections under her belt, Kokosalaki already has distinctive style and a highly developed and original sense of color.</p></div>"
95,fall,2001,f2001,strenesse,"Brave journalists rose with the sun (or rather, the Milanese fog) on Sunday morning in order to catch Strenesse's early-bird presentation.</p><p>Designer Gabriele Strehle showed a short, sparse collection that neatly encapsulated her minimalist approach to fashion. Using only gray, cream and black, Strehle sent out round-collar and double-lapel coats, girly Empire-waist dresses, schoolgirl cardigans, blousy tops and high-waist gathered-front skirts with double hems and delicate underlays—the type of clothes that a woman who believes in simple yet sophisticated dressing will love. Prehistoric-looking shearling coats and jackets added an edgy touch just as the looks veered toward the monotonous.</p><p>Strehle also went for the current lingerie-as-eveningwear trend—her sheer beige gathered slips with high double belts looked flirty and feminine, but never vulgar.</p></div>"
96,fall,2001,f2001,thimister,"Josephus Thimister’s show invitation announced that the designer was “back in action” after a six-month sabbatical.</p><p>Thimister celebrated by covering the floor of the Bataclan music hall with white carnations, which were promptly stomped on by rigid girls in military-inspired trenchcoats, tight pencil skirts and lace-up ankle booties. He then went on to experiment with long fur skirts, leather coats with pointy shoulders, rough-cut tops with little capes in the back, putty leather suits and snakeskin jackets.</p><p>Thimister’s main strength has always been his self-assured sense of direction, but this collection failed to present important new ideas. Still, it’s very welcome news that Thimister is once again in business; hopefully by next season he will have fully regained his stride.</p></div>"
97,fall,2001,f2001,trussardi,"Founded in 1910 as an upscale glove manufacturer, the Trussardi label always brings to mind old-school workmanship and classic elegance.</p><p>Having said that, the house is also visibly out of sync with the fashion moment. For Fall, Trussardi suggests a variety of leather-trimmed calfskin coats, suede shirts with awkwardly twisted button closures and half-velvet/half-suede cocktail numbers. Some pieces, like the thin turtlenecks, sharp leather skirts and little punched-suede dresses, will work fine as luxurious staples. But others, including blazers and wool dresses with calfskin insets, simply fall flat.</p><p>At a time when traditional labels are turning to a new generation of global-minded designers for inspiration, Trussardi could benefit from a similar jolt of adrenaline.</p></div>"
98,fall,2001,f2001,tuleh,"An imposing chandelier and dazzling cases of diamonds served as the backdrop for Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley's ""Americouture"" presentation of made-to-order designs at Harry Winston.</p><p>By all accounts, it was a stellar evening. Virtually every look that came down the runway was embellished with constellations of eye-catching stars—from the black-and-violet ruffle-trimmed leather coat that opened the show to the tone-on-tone embossed tuxedo, fly-away gypsy dresses, satin jeans and heavily beaded skirts. Things took a turn for the dramatic with a barely there translucent dress and top that relied only on a few strategically placed stars to ensure propriety; but Patner and Bradley also provided several massive furs to cover up and ward off autumn chills.</p><p>Tuleh's colorful, dramatic designs were generally festive and lighthearted; die-hard New Yorkers who can't fathom life without black will go for the short asymmetric dress with a side-swept ruffle winding its way along the hem, and the romantic, off-the shoulder Bohemian tops.</p></div>"
99,fall,2001,f2001,ungaro-couture,"Serge Gainsbourg's roué soundtrack set the perfect mood for Emanuel Ungaro's Gallic collection.</p><p>A crimson satin blouse with matching knickers, foulard, ribbon-tie heels and tilted beret called for a Pigalle after-hours cabaret and plenty of cigarettes; so did his slinky flyaway dresses and asymmetric muslin tops. Ungaro also delivered plenty of salt-and-pepper tailleurs, window-pane coats and Prince of Wales pantsuits—all rakish and slim, often livened up thanks to ruffled shirts with a solitary graphic button below the shoulder. Cocktail minidresses with gigantic candy-wrap bows, emerald-green trousers and a blinding fuchsia pantsuit reminded us of Ungaro's playful side.</p><p>The designer ended his show on a more serene note, with flowing jersey, satin, crepe and taffeta dresses embroidered with delicate little trees and flowers plucked from a Japanese garden.</p></div>"
100,fall,2001,f2001,valentino,"""I'm inspired by clothes that are worn not because they are in fashion, but because they make women feel unique and confident,"" wrote Valentino in his program notes. The statement sums up his house's devotion to a loyal clientele of over 40 years, rather than to the often whimsical shifts of the fashion moment.</p><p>All of Valentino's well-known classics turned up on his runway: elegant tailleurs, glamorous gowns and plenty of sparkle. Day wear was forceful and strong: Black crepe suits with embroidered off-white georgette shirts, pinstripe trousers and fur-trimmed vests all had a masculine air to them. Red-and-beige tweed pantsuits, long plaid skirts and fishnet tops provided more casual alternatives.</p><p>Valentino's requisite evening gowns were mostly black crepe sheaths lavished with sequins; a strass-embroidered satin gown was embellished with panthers, and long taffeta dresses came generously ruffled. But no Valentino show would be complete without a shock of red: Alek Wek dazzled in a bias-cut backless number with a pinched waist and a sprinkle of ostrich feathers on the skirt.</p></div>"
101,fall,2001,f2001,veronique-branquinho,"In fashion, the most powerful statement is sometimes understatement. Veronique Branquinho is one of those rare talents who can transform seemingly ordinary looks into absolutely poetic ensembles.</p><p>Branquinho's subtle touch made contrasting turtleneck-and-tunic combinations seem positively dreamy; perfectly proportioned tuxedos dazzled with brightly colored lapels and linings. Even the all-black segment of the show—distressed jackets, patchwork velvet dresses and knit jumpers—was serene and uplifting rather than angst-ridden. But the designer really hit her stride when she breathed new life into the most conventional wardrobe staples. With an unerring sense of color, Branquinho paired a camel pea coat with a coppery-brown turtleneck and a perfect pair of navy pants; casual overcoats came with tunnel belts that created a slight gather in the back; the tiniest drizzle of glitter on a V-neck sweater or on the cuff of a simple top spoke volumes.</p><p>Rather than scampering for attention-grabbing gimmicks every season, Branquinho is quietly and consistently turning out impeccable and sensible clothes, positioning herself as one of the most self-assured designers of her generation.</p></div>"
102,fall,2001,f2001,versace,"Gray Milanese skies greeted the tired fashion flock with marked disdain, unleashing a snowstorm of biblical proportions upon their arrival. But by the time Donatella Versace’s show began, all talk of delayed flights, traffic jams and mud-splattered Manolos had given way to the usual game of celebrity spotting as Sting, Trudie Styler, singer Goldie and a diamond-and-fishnets-clad Signora Russell Simmons made their way to the front row.</p><p>Versace played up many of the themes she explored recently with her couture collection. Graphic prints, fitted hips and corseted waistlines were all at the core of her collection, though she managed to stray from the old-school diva allure; Trompe l’oeil–denim leather jeans and fitted blazers, wide-wale corduroy blousons, plush parkas in cashmere and sable, and several blue-tinted knockabout furs all looked sensational yet casual and easy to wear. The same could not be said for a couple of cocktail dresses with leather derriere huggers and an inexplicable inability to contain the bust; fortunately, Versace offered plenty of other after-5 options that included long, flared and belted satin gowns, flirty mini coats and show-stopping lacquered lace dresses that should be turning up on plenty of red carpets in the near future.</p></div>"
103,fall,2001,f2001,versus-versace,"Boy George spun blaring tracks, the runway shone bright with millions of light bulbs and Donatella Versace's junior girls trotted down the runway at full speed.</p><p>It was the typical Versus setup: high energy, plenty of attitude and all-out clothes that included skimpy zippered corduroy miniskirts, colorfully printed one-armed dresses and acid-pink rough-and-tumble furs. An explosion of yellow and orange skirts, triple-eyelet tops and paint-swirl coats preceded a series of off-the-shoulder, beaded and sheer black dresses that often revealed more than was necessary.</p><p>The spirit at Versus was fun and cool; still, at times one wished there would've been a clearer direction. While it's certain that Donatella Versace knows her way around a sexy outfit, parts of the collection lacked her usual bravado and sense of control.</p></div>"
104,fall,2001,f2001,victor-alfaro,"Milan seems to agree with Victor Alfaro. The Mexican-American designer's glamorous collection of on-the-go chic was one of his strongest in seasons.</p><p>Alfaro opened with a few equestrian looks that included long, tan leather coats, skin-tight jockey pants and flat riding boots, but quickly moved on to more urban ensembles like suede trousers with slouchy optic sweaters, one-strap dresses and three-button suits. But Alfaro really found his groove with the more casual yet absolutely luxurious looks; distressed jeans with a chunky red turtleneck and a sinfully long fur, for example, looked fantastic. So did a huge fur-lined military-olive parka that was both street-smart and lavishly decadent; treat it as an everyday coat, or throw it over one of Alfaro's delicately layered or ruffle-trimmed sexy black dresses. After all, mixing soft, feminine clothes with hard-edged basics is one of the season's key trends.</p></div>"
105,fall,2001,f2001,viktor-rolf,"""We were inspired by black holes, which absorb all light and energy,"" explained a dead-serious, soot-covered Rolf backstage. ""We wanted to transform negative feelings into something positive and creative.""</p><p>If only everyone's stress-management techniques were as fruitful. Working exclusively in black (just ask the painted models, who were struggling with cold cream and reams of tissues after the show), and touching upon the best of masters like Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, the Dutch duo delivered one of the strongest, bravest collections of the season.</p><p>In what amounted to an exhaustive exploration of volumes, Viktor and Rolf showed everything from enormous, flared-sleeve gowns and coats to fitted shirts with massive collars that accommodated gargantuan scarves and ties. Asymmetric dresses were gently ruched at the side and paired with cropped jackets that morphed into flowing, capelike wraps; skinny pinstripe trousers looked anything but ordinary with a matching padded vest that created a top-heavy silhouette. Pleated and ruffled shirts, leather-striped jeans, sharp denim blazers and shiny shirtdresses showed that Viktor and Rolf can provide everyday clothes without sacrificing an ounce of creativity.</p></div>"
106,fall,2001,f2001,vivienne-tam,"""East West Techno Fantasy"" was the ominous title of Vivienne Tam's collection, foreshadowing allusions to <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>. Tongue-in-cheek references, however, are not enough to see a collection through. Tam's paint-drip tees, motorcycle jackets and moleskin trousers worked because they looked natural and unpretentious, but the show ran into trouble the moment Tam toyed with plush tiger jackets, gigantic and unfeasible fur-trimmed ponchos and puzzling cracked-patch skirts. Ditto for the evening looks, which included everything from feathered and beaded tunics to lotus-print dolman dresses.</p><p>On the upside, Tam showed several moleskin pants, embroidered sweaters and jersey tops that would be a worthwhile addition to any basic wardrobe. Sometimes, less is definitely more.</p></div>"
107,fall,2001,f2001,wink,"Designer Wynn Smith certainly knows his way around the hallmarks of adolescence: His fun, witty presentation felt like a guided tour of a cooler-than-thou high school <em>Who's Who</em>.</p><p>Remember the snobby seniors who never gave you the time of day? They were all there, if considerably less menacing now in their flannel coat-dresses, double-breasted navy wool coats and perky Fair Isle blouses. Also on hand were the moody Ally Sheedy types, hidden under layers of black corduroy, textured prairie skirts in need of a wash and shrunken blazers stolen from someone else's boyfriend. More outgoing types identified with the girls who dared to wear blue plastic trapeze dresses, tie-dyed tees, miniature shorts and striped turtlenecks.</p><p>Smith succeeded in mixing and matching an assortment of references into an eclectic postmodern wardrobe that evoked plenty of all-too-familiar memories but still managed to look absolutely fresh and new.</p></div>"
108,fall,2001,f2001,yohji-yamamoto,"Sporty Yohji? <em>Jamais</em>!</p><p>Think again—the Japanese master of fluid, dramatic silhouettes and couturelike craftsmanship proved that he can deliver plenty of surprises with a casual, athletic-inspired collection.</p><p>Naturally, this was no ordinary track-and-field uniform. Baseball-bomber blousons were designed to trap one of the arms of its wearer in its folds. Casual trousers came equipped with a short skirt overlay. A hooded baseball-inspired jacket was shown with a voluminous, ballooned floral-print skirt. And no Yamamoto show would be complete without artful draping: His long, amorphous coats revealed unexpected panels when least expected; asymmetric dresses exposed one arm and covered the other with a generous, flowing sleeve.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""wqm6hs""></div></div><p>Yamamoto’s accessories included visor sunglasses and velvety bags that doubled as scarves—but it’s the colorful sneakers with red soles, silver racing stripes and floral designs that will have customers lining up next Fall.</p></div>"
1,spring,2002,s2002,alberta-ferretti,"There were no major surprises at Alberta Ferretti, where frilly femininity is always in fashion.</p><p>Ferretti opened with a pleated tomato skirt, white shirt and double-breasted fitted blazer—a simple, sophisticated combination that could have been developed further. Instead, however, Ferretti quickly moved on to her signature sheer dresses, generously ruffled and gathered, some with ravaged ribbon trimmings or beaded detailing; an optical print made a brief appearance, only to recede into a sea of blush lingerie gowns.</p><p>Ferretti is known for her lyrical sense of style, but in this case, stricter pieces like her gold topstitched coat and straight trousers left a more lasting impression than the wispy dresses, which all seemed to merge into one.</p></div>"
2,spring,2002,s2002,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Femininity with a hard edge is Alessandro Dell'Acqua's trademark. The embroidered translucent dresses that have seemed so fragile on other runways looked tough and defiant here, cinched with wide, tooled belts or woven leather cords. A wispy chiffon slip looked almost threatening when accessorized with a mannish vest, a driving cap and dizzyingly high punched-suede shoe-boots. And crisscrossed lace strips on airy tops brought to mind nothing so much as a sexy gunslinger.</p><p>This collection was full of pieces that reinforced Dell'Acqua's signature vision—one-shoulder gladiator dresses, fitted suede jeans and off-kilter ruffle skirts. What it lacked was any indication of what else the designer might be capable of doing.</p></div>"
3,spring,2002,s2002,alexander-mcqueen,"""The Dance of the Twisted Bull"" was the title of Alexander McQueen's highly anticipated collection, his first since partnering with Gucci Group and deciding to show in Paris.</p><p>McQueen pulled off a bravura, Latin-themed romp. One particularly theatrical dress came equipped with <em>banderillas</em>—the long spears with which bullfighters pique bulls—that seemed to impale the wearer in order to support a long ruffled train in the back. Another, a severely deconstructed blood-red señorita dress, had part of a jacket attached at the waist, while a matador-inspired strapless gown featured a built-in sword. An assortment of polka-dotted frocks were layered over matching stockings, and cinched with corsetlike straps and holster-inspired tops.</p><p>Alongside these dramatic statements came plenty of carefully tailored, eminently wearable clothes, deftly proving McQueen's ability to mix iconoclastic statements with commercially viable product. Razored jackets were softened via seashell-like pleated skirts with gently upturned fronts; flared-sleeve eyelet shirts, layered skirts, and embroidered white jeans all looked confident, as did the cut-out dresses and sharp-as-a-tack toreador suits.</p></div>"
4,spring,2002,s2002,alexandre-matthieu,"Spread the word: Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, known collectively as Alexandre Matthieu, have decided that the era of angst-ridden conceptual clothing is over.</p><p>The duo propose a poppy, lighthearted aesthetic driven by a sense of feminine fun. Inspired by the '30s silhouettes of Madeleine Vionnet, Morgado and Bureau showed loose cocktail dresses embellished with starburst smatterings of paillettes. A single-button pearl-white cocktail dress came with trailing split sleeves, while a lightweight top looked as if it had been expertly airbrushed with a row of crashing waves across the shoulders. In a more contemporary vein, the duo also included sexy red leather trousers, a white bomber jacket with floral appliqués and a satin blazer cinched with a single delicate thread.</p></div>"
5,spring,2002,s2002,alice-roi,"For her fourth season, Alice Roi presented a pilgrim/Amish-themed show that proved her most mature and consistent collection to date.</p><p>Trading her popular '80s-inspired bubblegum-girl silhouettes for long, fluid shapes, Roi opened with ankle-length dresses featuring grosgrain detailing at the wrists and waistline; the monastic effect was offset by thoroughly downtown, old-school Reebok boots. The designer stuck with neutral raw shades like pewter and oatmeal for her flowing country skirts and monkey-print frocks, but also ventured into city chic with fitted trousers, knockabout blazers and a couple of short scalloped lace dresses. Less interesting were the puff-sleeved Victorian shirts and flamenco-inspired tiered dresses, of which we saw plenty last season. Here, they felt gimmicky and derivative.</p><p>Despite these occasional misfires, Roi's collection confirmed that she is a name to watch closely in the future.</p></div>"
6,spring,2002,s2002,an-american-view,"[Editor’s note: Predating the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund was An American View. Organized in the aftermath of 9/11, which occurred during Fashion Week, An American View was a group fashion show featuring the work of designers who had not presented their spring 2002 collections before the attack. Here Meredith Melling, who was then a market editor for <em>Vogue,</em> remembers how it all came together.]</p><p>In the immediate wake of 9/11, a lot of <em>Vogue</em> editors were reporting to the office. We were doing whatever kind of rescue and relief efforts we could; we were donating clothes to people who were working at the Twin Towers. While we were all in the office together [Condé Nast’s offices were then located in Times Square] working on these things, we were also talking about the fragility of all of these young designers whose shows were canceled. Some designers had gotten the opportunity to show, but then the rest of the week was canceled.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>We all know about the delicacy of those businesses; to have no one see your collection and potentially no orders coming in, that could make or break your business. Anna Wintour decided we should put together a show in support of these designers. The conditions would be that it would be a group show. They were identified as designers who <em>Vogue</em> saw had potential or distinction in the market, were doing something really cool and unique, were on the commercial fast track—the same way we ultimately started looking at designers for the Fashion Fund. To qualify, your show also had to have been canceled.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""n8nwr""></div></div><p>Anna reached out to Carolina Herrera, who donated her showroom as a space where we would host the show. And then the booking editor at the time reached out to all the agencies, and we got whatever models were still in town to donate their time. So the space was free, the models walked for free.</p><p>The show was nine days after 9/11, so it all happened really quickly. We held the fittings in the <em>Vogue</em> offices so that the models had one place to report to, and then the designers all came in too. The sentiment that we were encouraging and that all the participating designers were on board with was that this was about giving you visibility, this was about camaraderie, this was the industry coming together. Josh Patner of Tuleh gave opening remarks, and it was agreed that there would be no music. So it was a silent show, which was really interesting. Each designer walked with one model from their segment at the end.</p></div>"
7,spring,2002,s2002,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester has the rare ability to invest her punky, hard-edged clothes with a lovely, lyrical quality.</p><p>Slouchy, low-slung trousers and oversize jackets have always been part of the Demeulemeester repertoire, and this season was no exception—done in black and white silk, they looked the epitome of nonchalant chic. Draped dresses, extra-short miniskirts, gathered-neck shirts and wrap shirt-jackets were street-smart rather than girly, cinched carelessly at the hips with multiple-loop belts. Unstructured military jackets, distressed leather coats, and severe ankle boots rounded out the collection.</p><p>Demeulemeester deftly tackled this season’s layering theme via a series of belts that came with attached half-skirts. Worn over a short dress or skirt, they create a silhouette that is asymmetric, anarchic—and unfailingly cool.</p></div>"
8,spring,2002,s2002,anna-molinari,"Anna Molinari designer Rossella Tarabini's main strength is culling trends from the street and reinterpreting them for the catwalk.</p><p>Tarabini showed an assortment of skimpy, sheer baby-doll slips and lingerie-like tops that referenced Fall's underwear-as-outerwear obsession. Her layered minidresses, loose cardigans and antique-looking paillette tops were layered over utility cargo shorts—a look that might be just a bit much for many of the label's younger customers. The same could be said for the flapper-inspired dresses with plumed hems that closed the show.</p><p>Still, there were plenty of fashion-savvy wearable pieces to be mixed and matched. A black pleated minidress with a white beaded collar, for example, was effortlessly chic. Tarabini's cotton blazers, meanwhile, are great everyday staples, as are her striped tees, velvet jackets and flat, short boots.</p></div>"
9,spring,2002,s2002,anna-sui,"Western pioneers and prairie dwellers were the main source of inspiration this season for Anna Sui, a designer who has built her reputation on her ability to re-imagine the fashions of days gone by.</p><p>In her Art Nouveau-inspired showroom, equipped with wrought-iron mirrors, velour settees with heart-shaped backs and colored glass lamps, Sui showed antique denim dresses with embroidered hems, sheer Swiss-miss tops, and girly, dotted dresses worn with virginal white tights and ballerina flats. Spicing things up, the designer moved on to less innocent Daisy Duke-style short shorts, tight airbrushed jeans, and skimpy butterfly crepe shirts. Indigo and lace mini-frocks, floral tops and distressed cotton crochet dresses completed the collection.</p><p>Rounding off Sui's sexy update on Western saloon style were cameo brooches, turn-of-the-(nineteenth)-century necklaces and tan cowgirl boots.</p></div>"
10,spring,2002,s2002,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi reclaimed his Italian roots with a carefully staged backdrop that included a little Vespa motor scooter, an ice-cream stand and festively strewn lights.</p><p>Traditionally crafted leather and heavily worked lace—two of Berardi's favorite materials—were key to his collection. His see-through skintight trousers, razored jackets and ultraslim pants were sexy as ever (especially with the just-stumbled-out-of-bed Rapunzel hairdos on Berardi's models); textured denim jackets and jeans offered a slightly more sedate option. Die-hard fans will go for Berardi's lingerie-like party slips, which can go from the dance floor to the bedroom in the blink of an eye.</p><p>How to close such a high-powered presentation? Consider a stunning flapper-inspired silver paillette dress with a floral motif—a brave alternative to the understated simplicity that is so often championed on more conventional runways.</p></div>"
11,spring,2002,s2002,arkadius,"Think of Arkadius as the Alexander McQueen of Poland. Fully embracing the more theatrical side of London's Central Saint Martins college, the Slavic designer has, in past shows, “given birth” on the runway and brandished a rubber cast of his own severed head at the audience for a finale.</p><p>Arkadius' Spring collection, relatively low on dramatics compared to past performances, was based on a Catholic theme, the adoration of the Virgin. Beginning with a shaven-headed, bare-breasted “Mary” festooned with crucifixes and a crown of thorns, the show converted embroidery usually seen on priestly vestments into pants and dresses, while interspersing padded 3-D appliqués of the Madonna and Child and the Sacred Heart onto tops. In between, there were calmer moments where Arkadius worked with lace, georgette ruffles and paisley for party dresses with complicated cuts. Then the show reverted to a religious climax as a model paraded, in gold brocade pants, with her face inserted into an icon.</p><p>One poignant sight was the singular back view of a red jacket, with a dove of peace embroidered on the back.</p></div>"
12,spring,2002,s2002,badgley-mischka,"After spending a couple of seasons exploring the alien terrain of sensible daywear, Mark Badgley and James Mischka have gone back to their first love: the high-octane evening gowns that have made them nearly as famous as the Hollywood celebutantes they love to dress.</p><p>This season, the duo's attention-loving gowns have a decidedly antique feeling. An embroidered paisley column was lavished with candle-like drippings of translucent beads; dreamy shades of marigold, apricot, iris and tuberose gave a youthful spin to a slinky assortment of long sheaths that were generously decorated with cutouts and floral appliqués. The non-full-length department was represented by '20s-inspired Deco slips and shirtdresses.</p><p>For those few Badgley Mischka customers who venture outdoors before 6 p.m., there were several light tweed dresses and suits, including a jacket embellished with—no surprise here—a smattering of beads down the sides.</p></div>"
13,spring,2002,s2002,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière once again defined the mood of the moment, capturing the romantic, ethnic currents of this season with an exquisitely crafted Balenciaga collection.</p><p>Ghesquière started with his most elaborate pieces, showing beautiful patchwork vests, microdresses and jackets made from a collage of shimmering vintage Indian fabrics. Paired with loose, no-nonsense cargo trousers, they projected casual sophistication of the drop-dead cool variety. Ghesquière’s skimpy, ravaged pink salopettes served as a sweet prelude to his high-impact black-and-silver trousers and skirts; the final all-black, extra-loose vests and tuxedos played out like a clever deconstruction of fall’s Victorian corsets and bodices.</p><p>Ghesquière’s floating silhouettes are sure to be hugely influential next spring.</p></div>"
14,spring,2002,s2002,bally,"Inspired by the makeover success stories of labels such as Louis Vuitton and Burberry, Harvard-trained business-graduate-turned-designer Scott Fellows is determined to make Bally the next world-class luxury brand.</p><p>In these label-obsessed times, a globally recognized name is a prized asset for any fashion house. And for the last few seasons, Bally has made considerable efforts to update its prestigious history, opening revamped flagships and launching a full clothing line. After making a splash with last season's chic woven leathers, Fellows went for graphic, simple basics this time around. A white tailored pantsuit was accented with a diamond-pattern cummerbund waistband; square-ribbon skirts and shifts looked perfectly prim.</p><p>Bally's strategy is to create wearable, luxurious pieces that don't slavishly follow trends. While many of Fellows' designs fit that bill, others, like the geometric-inset leather dresses and trousers, fell short of expectations. If the label is to succeed in the competitive luxury-goods arena, the Bally team will have to flex a little more creative muscle.</p></div>"
15,spring,2002,s2002,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria went for tough romanticism this season, presenting a nearly all-white collection of sheer overlays worn with plenty of defiant attitude.</p><p>Azria's program notes promised visions of Saint Tropez and shades of the Riviera. In reality, the look was reminiscent of Zandra Rhodes' decidedly urban slashed handkerchief-point dresses. Fluid jerseys, supple suedes, dip-dye leathers and lightweight cottons were all layered, draped and wrapped asymmetrically. Leather cutout bustiers, short fitted skirts and skimpy crochet tops were all fun and youthful, though not particularly original. A short denim suit and an eggshell coat stood out as practical, everyday staples.</p><p>For his accessories, Azria reworked some of the most important fall favorites, including long macramé belts with streamers and western-inspired leather boots.</p></div>"
16,spring,2002,s2002,bernhard-willhelm,"Bernhard Willhelm has arrived as one of the most important designers of his generation, thanks in part to the sheer breadth of his creative range. In the past, he has given us everything from happy-go-lucky 80s pop chicks to naive housewives and, yes, even African dung-beetle chic.</p><p>Hundreds of tendril-like filament lights and a soundtrack by Depeche Mode set the mood for Willhelm's New Wave-influenced take on futurism circa 1983. The designer mashed together a range of pop culture references with theatrical masks and allusions to the movie ""Dune"" turning up on witty sweatshirt dresses. His postmodern tribe members can get away with wearing everything from Liquid Sky makeup to sweatsuits with slit peekaboo seams, wrap paillette skirts with computer-print faces, flowing desert smocks, clouds of tulle, and cartoon-like guardsmen coats.</p><p>Willhelm's accessories also stand out miles from the crowd. Witness a pair of perfectly flat fringed booties; a carry-all shaped like an animatronics bear (to be cradled like a baby); and a space-shuttle canvas tote.</p></div>"
17,spring,2002,s2002,betsey-johnson,"The gilded, mirrored, wallpapered and chandelier-laden salon of Manhattan’s Tavern on the Green formed the over-the-top setting for ""Muñequita,"" as Betsey Johnson dubbed her Latin-themed extravaganza.</p><p>Here is Johnson’s vision for Spring, from the bottom up. Start with cork-spike heels of vertigo-inducing heights, complete with iridescent straps; set them off with ankle-length fishnets and an ankle bracelet with a dangling cross. If you must insist on underwear, go for a demi-bra bikini set in neon colors and make sure it peeks out at all times. Next, throw on a multitiered fiesta minidress, a metallic lace-and-ribbon teddy or a cha-cha top with turquoise hot pants. Now top it all off with a jangle of gold bangles; enormous hoop earrings; an oversize ""BJ"" ring (that stands for Betsey Johnson, lest there be any confusion); shimmering makeup; hot-pink mesh gloves with the tips cut off; a tattoo or three; and a net bandanna worn over a floppy Panama hat.</p><p>Not quite enough for you? Then you might as well throw in a traditional mantilla, too—after receiving the Johnson treatment, they manage to look positively decadent.</p></div>"
18,spring,2002,s2002,bill-blass,"Lars Nilsson, now in his second season at Bill Blass, hit a home run with a collection that is sure to put the venerable fashion house firmly back on the map.</p><p>How does a Swedish-born, Paris-trained designer interpret classic American style? By staying true to Blass' legacy of simple sophistication. With witty references to masculine tailoring, Nilsson went for high-waisted trousers, immaculately cut striped blazers, and pale glen-plaid suits. The designer also demonstrated his acuity with color, via floral coats and skirts, a cravat-printed shirtdress, breezy jackets, and dresses stamped with a bold ""vegetable tree"" motif.</p><p>The evening statements, however, were the real newsmakers. Using humble, homespun fabrics like cotton piqué and linen, Nilsson whipped up extraordinary gowns and sweeping ball skirts. Erin O'Connor's final ensemble neatly encapsulated the theme of understated chic: An unassuming pale-blue linen jacket, worn with a painstakingly embroidered sunflower skirt to the floor, looked like a million bucks.</p></div>"
19,spring,2002,s2002,blaak,"Though many designers who are equipped to show elsewhere have quit the London scene this season, others are stepping into the limelight to defend the city's creative reputation. One such is Blaak, the collection by Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, who showed on the official British Fashion Council runway for the first time.</p><p>The theme was African Zulu, starting with strong pieces in ebony leather, decorated with tribal scarification patterns and festooned with belts and jewelry in wood, leather and cowrie shells by Edward Griffiths. Black jersey T-shirts with cutouts and knotted details looked great with soft skirts, but the confidence of Blaak's touch really emerged as the pair added asymmetric skirts with black and white prints, and a crumpled cotton collarless shirt.</p><p>""It was our interpretation of African,"" said Okada, ""but instead of direct, indirect. It should be something you could wear in London or New York. We wanted it to be super-tribal, super-happy, so you feel the heat."" That's an act of solidarity, not insensitivity, she added.

20,spring,2002,s2002,hugo-boss,"Now in its third season of producing women's clothing, Boss Hugo Boss is making a strong play to join the ranks of prominent international designer brands. Despite being based in a quiet suburb of Stuttgart, Germany, Boss taps into the most current trends and translates them into sleek, highly wearable collections.</p><p>Since Boss made its name in menswear, it's no surprise that its women's line is based around a core of tailored suits and trim shirts. By playing with sheer fabrics, plunging necklines and layers of featherweight fabrics, these traditionally masculine pieces deliver a real jolt of femininity. Glazed chiffon is cut into black evening column dresses with scoop necks. An airy cotton shift-dress goes beyond basic with a subtle row of intricate cross-seams down the front. And a silky navy suit turns out to be pinstriped, as shimmery silver lines catch the light.</p><p>For a reasonably priced collection (think somewhere between Miu Miu and Prada), Boss Hugo Boss uses rich fabrics and cuts them with exacting precision.</p></div>"
21,spring,2002,s2002,boudicca,"Boudicca partners Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby were both peaceful observers of the tempestuous events surrounding the G-7/8 Summit in Genoa this year, and their ""Corporate Deserters"" presentation was designed to convey some of the tension and anguish they felt there.</p><p>Boudicca's masked models stepped out to a menacing soundtrack that featured the whir of surveillance helicopters. In homage to the early British warrior queen for whom the label is named, many of the clothes were dyed woad blue—the color of the war paint that she used. The severe tailoring and complex dressmaking, meanwhile, conjured a couture vision of the '50s, as filtered through an early '80s electro-pop sensibility. Boxy shouldered jackets and trousers with squared-off box-pleat hems were juxtaposed with pencil-skirted '50s air-hostess dresses or elaborate evening gowns. The gowns, in taffeta and old-fashioned brocades (and featuring the most hard-edged use of eyelet embroidery so far this season) had the look of midcentury haute couture pieces, their elaborate construction paradoxically set off with raggedly unfinished seams.</p><p>Memories of Genoa were reflected in cryptic details—like brass name tags, or the legend ""FAULT,"" with an arrow pointing toward an arm seam—that cannot have the same resonance for those who weren't there.</p></div>"
22,spring,2002,s2002,bruce,"Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, who make up the design team Bruce, snapped up this year's Perry Ellis Award for womenswear, and with good reason. The duo consistently produces quietly intelligent, sophisticated clothes whose apparent simplicity betrays an almost compulsive attention to detail.</p><p>Noselli and Gutierrez worked with a muted chromatic range (white, black, khaki and brick were the only colors in the collection), relying on clean, perfectly proportioned lines for effect. A pristine tab-collar cotton shirtdress was stark and immaculate, except for a copper cincture at the waist and minute pin-tucks that decorated the sleeves; dresses gently skimmed the body, shaped only by deftly applied tucks and folds. A triple layer of pleats ran across the shoulders of a prim cap-sleeve shirt; an off-kilter skirt looked perfect with an intricately constructed, asymmetric sleeveless top.</p><p>""We wanted to work with pleating, like last season, but presenting a looser, more comfortable silhouette,"" said Noselli after the show.</p></div>"
23,spring,2002,s2002,burberry-prorsum,"Just as Burberry's latest ad campaign was startlingly plaid—and logo-free—the once staid English company's Spring show broadened the scope of its style while remaining true to its London roots.</p><p>Former Gucci lieutenant Christopher Bailey has distilled the Burberry look into several core elements that offer a grown-up take on London street style. Pants come low-slung, straight and full through the calf, ending in a devil-may-care puddle well below the ankle. Skirts are cut either short around the thigh with punky grommet belts or in haphazard-looking loose drapes. Colors mainly stick to mellow hues of khaki, aubergine, black and navy, with a few zaps of jade and violet.</p><p>While crinkled blouses and loudly striped tank tops might seem a little too street for a lady who lunches (and can afford designer clothes), Bailey wisely tops off his grungier pieces with chic khaki trenchcoats and tailored pinstripe jackets. This kind of balancing act is just what the label needs to woo fickle big spenders, not just in London but in L.A. and beyond.</p></div>"
24,spring,2002,s2002,cacharel,"The Cacharel stage was decorated by illustrator Julie Verhoeven with drawings of pixie-like creatures, complemented by swirling laser projections—the perfect setting for the kaleidoscopic designs presented by Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro.</p><p>""Spanish Harlem Sunday Best meets Teenage Mall-Rat"" was how the duo described their cocktail of orchid prints, table-cloth ginghams, brushstroke floras, cartoon animals and colorful toiles de Jouy. Cacharel's renaissance has been driven by this poppy, lighthearted esthetic, and this season should satisfy young customers with plenty of cool basics like candy-colored chevron jackets, sexy jersey dresses, flower-power suits and high-impact bags and mules.</p><p>At times, however, Clements and Ribeiro's enthusiasm got the best of them. The extended parade of sugary, pretty-girl dresses and a final series of Victorian lace numbers left some hankering for a sobering shot of insulin.</p></div>"
25,spring,2002,s2002,calvin-klein-collection,"""It's not all I planned to show, but this selection encapsulates the general feeling of the collection,"" said Calvin Klein. Demonstrating New Yorkers' eagerness to get back to business as usual, Klein staged a small showroom presentation just a few days after fashion week had to be canceled.</p><p>""There's lots of boyish shapes and silhouettes,"" said Klein as the first model took to the makeshift runway. ""Jackets and coats are cut with large shoulders. Everything is big, but not too big."" Klein officially launched a new Spring favorite: the mannish, oversize white shirt, which can be thrown over snappy shorts, tucked into full, pleated trousers or worn with a hefty belt as a short, sexy dress. Pinstripe trousers matched with a half-sleeve button-down offered a playful take on traditional power dressing, while a group of aubergine and navy dresses with Deco-inspired paneling and stitching offered a more feminine counterpoint to the masculine tailoring. (""They remind me of the Chrysler building,"" said Klein.)</p><p>What about accessories? Those who are already fearing boot overload by the time March rolls around will be more than ready for Klein's no-nonsense gladiator sandals and flat patent slides. On the hunt for the perfect evening bag? A tiny, silver-beaded clutch could be just the thing—provided, of course, you never carry more than keys and lipstick.</p></div>"
26,spring,2002,s2002,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera is in a lighthearted mood, focusing on soft silhouettes embellished with romantic details.</p><p>The white shirt was the central theme of her collection; it came laced up, tucked into generous skirts, delicately embroidered and worn as a camisole over pajama pants. For contrast, there were coffee-and-emerald check pants and skirts, stone poplin suits and a great silk crepe dress with a pleated flapper fringe and nude back. Herrera also showed a few leather shirts and wrap skirts, but these felt a bit cumbersome and stiff at times.</p><p>Evening was a smorgasbord of pleats. Old-school gowns and grand sweeping skirts in pearl-gray organza stole all the thunder from the charmeuse tank gowns, which offered a familiar spin on the current lingerie-dressing craze.</p></div>"
27,spring,2002,s2002,celine,"Michael Kors' sunny, low-key Celine collection was full of what he does best: pretty, practical summer staples that make an easy transition from the beach to a poolside soiree.</p><p>Though Kors' program notes talked about his Mediterranean inspiration, it was the graphic designs of '60s Scandinavian cult label Marimekko that was brought to mind by the designer's large avocado-and-paprika sunflower-print jackets, coats and skirts. Kors interspersed his flower-power looks with breezy crochet shells, crepe jersey tank dresses and multistripe canvas shorts and shirts; rounding things out were flat sandals and a roomy tote. For cocktail hour there were snappy turquoise-, amethyst- and silver-beaded dresses that looked just as relaxed as the daywear.</p></div>"
28,spring,2002,s2002,cerruti,"""The collection is about tenderness, using soft fabrics with wallpaper prints and mattress stripes, all worked into fluid shapes,"" said Peter Speliopoulos during his small showroom presentation.</p><p>Speliopoulos' collection was one of his best ever for Cerruti. Filmy peasant tops, tiered miniskirts and camisole dresses with romantic overlays projected laid-back comfort. Smart linen blazers, casual suede jeans and a great disc-studded cotton jacket fringed with shoelaces all looked as though they had enjoyed a fabulous previous life. Carefully thought-out details, like rope cinches on flared-sleeve blouses and weighty ruffled collars on boho dresses, made some of the softer pieces extra-special.</p><p>To complete this easygoing wardrobe, Speliopoulos debuted a Cerruti accessories line, featuring flat, simple sandals, large totes and a great washed-lizard clutch.</p></div>"
29,spring,2002,s2002,chalayan,"Fresh from his six-month sabbatical, Hussein Chalayan is back in business, and better than ever. After the comparatively lackluster presentations of Milan, Chalayan opened Paris fashion week with a much-needed burst of creative energy.</p><p>""The collection was based on cursing, voodoo and superstition,"" said the designer after the show, adding that he had been inspired by a book called The Dictionary of Superstition. Balancing high-concept experimentation with urban practicality, Chalayan's deconstructed panels, zippered layers and off-kilter silhouettes came together beautifully. Short, pleated skirts with streamers and asymmetric sleeveless tops looked effortless, despite their elaborate seaming and detailing. A green, tooled leather jacket with gathered shoulders and dangling cords was an exercise in sculptural precision; frayed-edge jackets, practical minis and lace-up trousers had plenty of real-world appeal.</p><p>Chalayan devotees remember that his college graduation project consisted of iron-filled paper clothes that had been buried in his garden and allowed to rust. In a reprise of that strategy, some parts of Chalayan's stunning final dresses had once again been buried and aged, giving them a timeless, almost mythic aura.</p></div>"
30,spring,2002,s2002,chanel,"The newly rakish, ultrasvelte Karl Lagerfeld was in a youthful mood, opening his Chanel show with sporty motorcycle ensembles, two-tone sneakers, collegiate messenger bags and colorful backpacks.</p><p>More traditional Chanel staples followed, in the house’s beloved black and white. Snappy little coats and sexy tunnel jackets lined in satin could be worn with fitted trousers, or on their own as skimpy minidresses. These were a prelude to more fluid, romantic silhouettes: For 2002, Chanel skirts are long and sheer, belted at the hip, knife-pleated and paired with simple cashmere tees. Muslin dresses also fall to the ankles, and can be layered under ruffled tops.</p><p>Lagerfeld accented many of his more high-powered looks with rows of Coco pearls; these also turned up as sexy straps on his kitten-heel boots and shoes.</p></div>"
31,spring,2002,s2002,chloe,"Phoebe Philo proved herself quite capable of taking over the creative reigns of a major house like Chloé.</p><p>Avoiding in-your-face rock ’n’ roll attitude, Philo blurred the distinction between day and evening wear with breezy separates inspired by ’70s Saint Tropez, Brigitte Bardot, and Talitha Getty. A sense of easygoing elegance permeated everything from fitted tops with intricately worked sleeves to lace-trimmed camisoles and fabulous monkey-appliqué bathing suits. A long suede skirt with blush gray and black panels exuded earthy chic, as did the Moroccan-style beaded bags and sandal-boots in aged gold leather.</p><p>Die-hard Chloé fans will be glad to know that there are still plenty of high-impact sexy staples to be had. The low-slung flared pants with flirty cutouts at the hips, pinafore shorts, summery minidresses and punchy T-shirts with net backs are likely to keep cash registers working overtime.</p></div>"
32,spring,2002,s2002,christian-dior,"John Galliano’s “Street Chic” collection took the form of a virtual world tour, with stops that included lavishly clad Bedouins, army recruits and girls in the ’hood.</p><p>This was not the first time Dior has gone globetrotting, but Galliano injected, as always, new energy into his ethnic excursions. His bias-cut silk and lace dresses, embroidered jackets and sheer tops will work better than ever in this season of unbridled romanticism. Python jackets and low-slung hip-hop jeans also seem right for the moment, while the more eye-popping pieces—like the glittering pantsuit embroidered with kitschy Americana motifs—are just the thing for a starlet’s weekend jaunt to Vegas.</p><p>Galliano also showed a series of great-looking patchwork and Mexican serape-print bathing suits, embellished with utilitarian canvas straps.</p></div>"
33,spring,2002,s2002,christian-lacroix,"For Spring 2002, Christian Lacroix incorporated Art Nouveau references into his opulent, romantic style.</p><p>Silk blouses were piped in leather and embroidered with graphic tulle swirls; mottled, metallic-tinted leather jackets came with corset closures and cutouts. Lacroix's dresses—always elaborate experiments in color and patching—were asymmetrically cut and often distressed, sometimes extremely so. There were several beautiful, billowy embroidered blouses, one paired with pegged tomato crepe jogging trousers. A simple trenchcoat became paparazzi-worthy when executed in embroidered red organza.</p><p>Eveningwear is Lacroix's forte, and this season his standouts are taffeta blouses with frilled and pleated necklines, jackets with knotted sleeves, and printed chiffon tunics, all embellished with a peacock motif.</p></div>"
34,spring,2002,s2002,clements-ribeiro,"Referencing ""The St. Tropez of Veruschka and Jane Birkin, San Francisco's Summer of Love and the London of Bianca and Mick Jagger,"" Clements Ribeiro traveled back to the days of haute bohemia with diagonal-panel peace-and-love skirts, off-the-shoulder prairie tops and ruffle-cascade chiffon dresses. Though these hippie classics have become overly familiar of late, several of Clements Ribeiro's pieces had verve to spare. There was a great fringed poncho dress, several naively embroidered skirts and jeans, and a series of star-studded, sporty cashmere sweaters.</p><p>Rounding out the equation were lavishly fringed sandals and totes—the first installments in Clements Ribeiro's just-launched accessories line.</p></div>"
35,spring,2002,s2002,comme-des-garcons,"What inspires Rei Kawakubo is one of fashion’s million-dollar questions. The elusive designer once told <em>Vogue</em> that her collections are built around “whatever I am feeling at that moment”; for Spring 2002 that must have been childlike. There was an airy sense of innocence to this show, which at moments leaned toward kawaii. Kawakubo made use of an adorable novelty print featuring pugs. Pugs! There was also a fabric emblazoned with large graphic numbers, like those that might appear in a youngster’s schoolbook. Moreover, plastered to the models’ heads were papier-mâché caps made of newsprint that gave them the look of old-time porcelain Pierrot dolls.</p><p><em>Naive</em> is a word critics often and perhaps too readily apply to Kawakubo’s work, which is as forthright in its deconstruction as it is complicated in conception. This show, with its bows and ruffs, seemed more straightforward than many, save for its title, Ethnic Couture. What does it mean? Could Kawakubo have been referencing Dutch Old Masters or just having fun? Whatever the answer, she made it look as easy as one-two-three.</p></div>"
36,spring,2002,s2002,costume-national,"Ennio Capasa's Costume National collection, executed almost entirely in black and white, was thankfully short.</p><p>At heart, Capasa is a minimalist who emphasizes form above everything else—he is at his best designing sharp jackets and no-nonsense trousers. Why then, would he choose to cinch most of his looks with unflattering bodybuilder belts-turned-corsets? The effect was jarring and distracting.</p><p>Worn without those unfortunate accessories, many of Capasa's clothes will work just fine as sensible everyday uniforms—the roomy overcoats, eyelet-trimmed skirts and peasant shirts are all in touch with current trends. Nonetheless, it was disappointing to see Capasa strike only one note through the entire show.</p></div>"
37,spring,2002,s2002,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley has always been a good answer for young women in search of affordable party frocks without too much of an edge. With their distinctly American roots, Rowley's designs are reassuringly familiar, but with enough of a twist to keep them fresh.</p><p>This season Rowley jumped on the ethereal peasant bandwagon, spinning metallic lace and sweet embroidered cotton into looks fit for a Woodstock reveler. While some of the midriff-baring blouses and tight patent belts looked awkward, the bulk of this collection is ideal for Springtime patio cocktail parties from Silverlake to Sag Harbor.</p><p>The knockout number? A metallic purple lace cocktail dress with a U-shaped neckline, which is bold and rich looking without being flashy.</p></div>"
38,spring,2002,s2002,d-g,"For their Spring 2002 D&amp;G collection, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce exchanged the world of techno dance clubs—one of their recurring points of reference—for that of ballet companies, replete with satin toe shoes and a barre.</p><p>Like so many <em>A Chorus Line</em> hopefuls, models swished into the curvy show space clad in bunched and tightly layered tops, skirts, jackets and leggings, often wound up with thick satin ribbons and chiffon streamers. Giddy tutus morphed into full tiered skirts, worn with cheeky slogan T-shirts and snuggly wrapped cardigan sweaters. Washed-out tones of gray, nude and khaki played off neon-green blasts.</p><p>As with most D&amp;G shows, the piled-on look is meant to ignite flash fires of lust among teenage fashion fanatics. The good news is that, taken piece by piece, the collection is full of surprisingly wearable clothes.</p></div>"
39,spring,2002,s2002,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg is moving beyond the wrap dress. Sure, there are still plenty of those all-time favorites to choose from (this season there's even a lace one), but the designer is clearly eager to liven things up by throwing new elements into the mix.</p><p>With her West Village townhouse packed to capacity, and with the likes of Susan Sarandon, Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer and Tracey Ullman in the front row, von Furstenberg unleashed a parade of ""rebel princesses."" Plasticized miniskirts, cha-cha skirts, and chiffon boudoir chemises worn over cigarette pinstripe pants are now staples of the von Furstenberg wardrobe. A ""boss woman"" striped dress was worn with a black ruffle bikini; for evening, a formal tuxedo consisted of a cropped, navel-baring jacket and pajamalike pull-up trousers.</p><p>Of course, there were also more traditional selections to choose from. A ""floating O's"" print showed up on lightweight dancer skirts and dresses; practical safari jackets, shrunken blazers and suede trousers will work perfectly as a no-nonsense, everyday uniform.</p></div>"
40,spring,2002,s2002,dolce-gabbana,"Who better to embody Dolce &amp; Gabbana's vision of high-intensity glamour than Victoria Beckham, formerly known as Posh Spice? In her fitted top-stitched suit, oversize aviators, driving cap, spike heels and net gloves (over which was slipped a candy-sized diamond ring), Mrs. Beckham made the perfect front-row celebutante for this full-on show.</p><p>Posh surely found plenty to catch her silver-accented eye: Dolce &amp; Gabbana offered everything from perfectly tailored jackets and elephant-leg trousers to corseted frocks and ultra-feminine lace-inset dresses (worn with skimpy cardigan wraps thrown over the shoulders and tied in the front). The upbeat collection escalated into an explosion of color that included eye-popping flower-print chiffon dresses, woven ribbon jackets and miniskirts, and suede jeans with purple, gold, lavender and red leather insets. The absolute standout was a short parakeet-print dress in jungle shades, worn with a multihued woven belt and a pink-and-green carrier purse.</p><p>Accessories, anyone? Major statements included a metallic logo belt, gold D and G pendants, and a dangling set of earrings that spelled out—what else?—""Dolce"" and ""Gabbana.""</p></div>"
41,spring,2002,s2002,donna-karan,"It has not been an easy year for Donna Karan, who lost her husband to cancer just a few months ago. ""My private grief has now become part of a collective one,"" said the designer, adding that her ""collection was inspired by my husband, his art and everything he loved.""</p><p>The collection is certainly a strong one. Working with featherweight parachute silks, Karan created shimmering belted crinoline coats, cross-pleat skirts and some of the best ponchos we've seen in years (why not wear a platinum stretch silk, double-breasted, double-front poncho trench as an evening gown?). Experimenting with asymmetric seaming to create surprising volume, the designer produced intriguing structures that floated over the body, often stretched over armatures or held together with boning. The architectural motif extended to the long, hand-painted silk organza dresses, some of which were accessorized with Robert Lee Morris' sculptural wire jewelry.</p></div>"
42,spring,2002,s2002,dries-van-noten,"The folk revival has been all too common this season, but Dries Van Noten breathed new life into the overworked concept with his fluid, gentle lines and unerring sense of color.</p><p>Tie-dyed robes evoked the serenity of the Himalayas rather than the grunge of Berkeley in the 60s; floor-length camisoles, wrap blanket coats and minutely embroidered peasant shirts hit just the right note. More urban staples like blazers and trousers were unstructured and amply cut; an oversized, olive green parka looked soft and delicate when belted and bloused.</p><p>Even die-hard minimalists will be tempted to incorporate one of Van Noten’s extra-wide beaded scarves, a low-slung organic bag or a pair of colorful heels into their functional wardrobes.</p></div>"
43,spring,2002,s2002,emilio-pucci,"Designer Julio Espada is now in his second season at Pucci, attempting to revive the fashion house's glory days and make it relevant for a new generation.</p><p>Capitalizing on Pucci's bold, instantly recognizable prints, Espada showed plenty of pretty, girly shorts, scarf sundresses and crisp cotton jackets. Chic, quirky details included cork buttons on poolside robes and mother-of-pearl embroidery on little halters, frothy evening gowns and knotted handbags. The outsized prima-donna sunglasses were also a hit.</p><p>The Pucci name, however, has always stood for practicality as much as high-impact glamour. And Espada's collection, though sweet and well-executed, lacked much of the easygoing simplicity of the label's classic jersey turtlenecks and zip-up jackets. Nostalgia alone will not propel this brand into the future.</p></div>"
44,spring,2002,s2002,emporio-armani,"Emporio Armani sent a fleet of innocent smiling girls down the runway en route to a tropical paradise.</p><p>This nautically themed collection began with wavy frills and ruffles peeping out from snappy sailor jackets. Simple petticoats were embellished with vivacious kerchief hems; skirts, dresses and trousers were all trimmed with generous cascades of fringe. (The skimpy black dress Alek Wek wore was the best of the lot.) Sporty, colorful island dresses packed plenty of Hawaiian punch, as did the petal-ruffle minis.</p><p>The holiday mood blossomed into striped and floral shirts, embroidered and layered over tops and dresses. Jet beads and pearl embroideries finished off dramatic tulle evening gowns that were accessorized with half-circle earrings and black-flower leis, and fringed with the ubiquitous belt skirts.</p></div>"
45,spring,2002,s2002,fendi,"In sharp contrast to the girly aesthetic that has prevailed during these collections, Karl Lagerfeld presented the Fendi woman as strong, confident and even, at times, aggressive.</p><p>Banishing delicate pastel tones, Lagerfeld clad his nomadic warriors in every shade of brick, mauve and brown, better to complement their choppy braided hairdos and tribal tattoo eye makeup. Layers were key. Sheer smocks and subtly printed shirts wafted over fitted trousers cinched above the knee with tie-straps; trailblazer skirts, worked-leather frontier vests, ruffled frocks and minutely embellished sheer tunics were all piled atop each other with abandon.</p><p>These dramatic ensembles may not be the most practical everyday staples, but Fendi's accessories are sure to be among the season's best sellers. Lagerfeld's then-and-now studded oyster bags, tooled leather boots and distressed woven sashes all looked like they could have been transported by mule from the outback to the Via Sciesa showroom.</p></div>"
46,spring,2002,s2002,gianfranco-ferre,"Poised high on an oversize velvet pillow and surrounded by lavishly embroidered blankets, a shawl-clad figure played the sitar as guests took their seats for Gianfranco Ferré's romp through Indian style.</p><p>Ferré worked plenty of his signature architectural flights of fancy into the show. Carefully constructed white coats and caftan jackets morphed into pegged trousers accented with hand-beaded silver strips. Elaborate organza creations featured drawstring furrowings, spiral encirclings, and textured appliqués. Metallic stitching turned up on leather skirts; silk patchwork pants were worn with embroidered twinsets; and long skirts and gowns were trimmed with dangling gold coins. Ferré's finale took the form of a glow-in-the-dark series of embroidered tangerine, lemon and orange dresses.</p><p>Fans of Ferré's extravagant aesthetic were not disappointed.</p></div>"
47,spring,2002,s2002,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani had plenty to celebrate today. His presentation served as the official inauguration of the impressive Armani theater, nestled within his brand-new, 12,000-square-meter commercial headquarters designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando.</p><p>Armani presented a light, fluid collection executed mostly in black and white. Jackets were slightly squared, short and structured, paired with asymmetric-hem trousers. Off-the-shoulder, striped handkerchief tops suggested a Deauville getaway, while a series of tank dresses blended athletic chic with ballet-inspired romanticism. Transparency was the mantra for evening, with brilliantly embroidered flowers inching their way up wide-leg trousers and barely there gowns.</p><p>In an adjacent room, Armani also hosted a photographic exhibition, <em>The Making of the Pirelli Calendar 2002</em>. The behind-the-scenes photographs were taken by Peter Lindbergh while shooting the iconic calendar, which this year features Hollywood's brightest young stars wearing … Giorgio Armani.</p></div>"
48,spring,2002,s2002,givenchy,"After his awkward debut during couture week, Welsh designer Julien Macdonald is still struggling to find his feet.</p><p>The house of Givenchy has always been known for its purity of line and simplicity of design—the polar opposite of Macdonald's heavy-handed use of ruching, cord inlays and cabled trims. While some pieces were finely made—notably a striking off-white poplin dancer skirt with layered crinolines and a pink marbleized dip-dye shirt—they got lost in an overabundance of decoration. Macdonald's high-waist pegged trousers, too sheer smocked dresses and fussy riding jackets all felt contrived.</p><p>Ultimately, this collection fell short of forging the new identity that Givenchy seeks.</p></div>"
49,spring,2002,s2002,gucci,"Forget fitted silhouettes and uptight elegance. Tom Ford is ushering in a relaxed, laid-back feeling at Gucci.</p><p>Ford's new aesthetic marries hip-hop savoir faire—ultra-casual pants and asymmetrical-seam jackets were cut extra-wide—with Route 66 favorites like raw suede blazers, desert tops, and large coats that lace in the back. A stunning liquidy silk skirt was embellished with large floral cutouts; explorer shorts were worn with skimpy superfine knits. Ford showed gently gathered smocks and a double-layered black dress riveted with diminutive eyelet hooks—furthering the fresh spin on the romantic concepts he has explored of late.</p><p>While not everyone will embrace Ford's new supersized proportions, there is bound to be unanimous enthusiasm for his self-assured evening gowns: frothy Empire concoctions that fall to the floor, with draped backs that offer a voyeuristic peek at the rigorously laced corsets underneath.</p></div>"
50,spring,2002,s2002,halston,"This is Craig Natiello's fourth season at Halston, a house with a glorious past whose recent history has been somewhat tumultuous.</p><p>Today Halston is the place to turn for special-occasion dressing, particularly if you are looking for a printed or embellished column dress for a night on the town. Among the best looks from the Spring collection are a black Empire-waist floor-length dress with center-front slit, and a navy-and-white overblown silk floral.</p><p>Natiello's reign at Halston continues the long tradition of Seventh Avenue dress- and suit-makers rather than that of Roy Halston Frowick, a true innovator, whose legacy continues to have an important influence on designers today.</p></div>"
51,spring,2002,s2002,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow has officially arrived. Stepping into the London void left by Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan, who will show in Paris this season, the South African-born Morrow staged a concise, all-white collection that was imaginative, rigorous and thoroughly convincing.</p><p>The 33-year-old designer juxtaposed five fabrics in a performance that had girls walking, in white boxing boots, through a shallow vat of violet dye. Morrow worked high-tech Aertex and reflective nylon with Old World damask, organdy and voile, cutting some superb tailored jackets and romantic skirts that ended up trailing their asymmetric hemlines into the colored liquid. The spirit was that of a sporty, otherworldly warrior woman—an image crystallized by a girl in a massive shawl of shredded organdy and a pair of shorts, like some athletic archangel.</p><p>For all the complex styling, which bound elastic webbing around torsos and slung glass-bead harnesses across garments, this collection had clarity beyond the usual grasp of experimental newcomers. (Morrow, who was a contemporary of Chalayan's at Central Saint Martins and studied menswear at London's Royal College of Art, honed his skills as a freelance designer at Byblos, under John Bartlett, and elsewhere.) This is a designer expressing his own independent vision, and it looks good.</p></div>"
52,spring,2002,s2002,helmut-lang,"Mixing romanticism, sex, and science, Helmut Lang's Spring 2002 collection balanced flesh-baring cutouts and bondage-style harnesses with Great Gatsby-style femininity.</p><p>Lang played hard and soft off against each other throughout the show. Strappy body suits were worn under flapper-like dresses or paired with pleated skirts; patent and metallic leather mingled with soft, sensual materials including silk chiffon and even perch skin. The angular geometry of pleats, v-necks and mirrored minaudières, meanwhile, was countered by rounder, arched necklines and open-toed shoes.</p><p>Lang added vibrancy to a severe palette of black, white and gray via dashes of deep red and purple, as well as prints designed in-house. One of these featured wings; another, though it resembled leopard spots, was in fact a rendering of biological cells.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""34x9m""></div></div><p>Originally scheduled to be shown on the catwalk in Paris, Lang's collection is instead being presented via the Internet, CD-ROM, lookbooks and showtapes (echoing the designer's successful alternative show format of 1998). ""I am sure that everybody will understand that I have to be in New York right now,"" Lang says. ""Presenting the Helmut Lang collection here is our way of supporting business in New York.""</p></div>"
53,spring,2002,s2002,hermes,"The look <em>Vogue</em> favored from Martin Margiela’s Spring 2002 collection for Hermès was crisp and conservative. “British Empire spic-and-span” is how the magazine described the white cotton shirt, canvas skirt, and canvas and leather riding boots Steven Meisel photographed on Karolina Kurkova.</p><p>But with the exception of those boots, this collection was not at all horsey—camp shirts and khakis evoking vast Saharan prairies rather than paddocks. Adding an urban accent to the proceedings were the wide black leather bandeaux that kept the models’ hair away from their faces.</p></div>"
54,spring,2002,s2002,imitation-of-christ,"For Imitation of Christ, the designer collective of Matthew Damhave and Tara Subkoff (and creative director Chloë Sevigny), fashion is one-third clothes and two-thirds performance. In past seasons, they have lured journalists to funeral parlors and hit them up for money; this time around, they decided to switch the roles of editors and models.</p><p>With RuPaul's ""Supermodel, work!"" playing at full volume as a backdrop, editors were lined up and ushered into a makeshift runway flanked by an audience of models equipped with pad and paper. As comments like ""Move along, please!"" and ""She's gained so much weight!"" blared through the speakers, the models-turned-journalists took notes and studiously ogled the press parade. Needless to say, they were all wearing Imitation's salvaged, recycled, one-of-a-kind tiered frocks, pouf minidresses, graffiti-scribbled Bermuda shorts and lace vests. Blazers were unceremoniously slashed and reconfigured, dresses tied at the hem, and skirts draped and ruched haphazardly. Amid all the madness, Imitation of Christ managed to produce some great-looking pieces.</p><p>Most importantly, though, magazine folk now know what it feels like to be a top model. All we need now is to start making their salaries….</p></div>"
55,spring,2002,s2002,jasper-conran,"London fashion week got off to a quiet but determined start, in spite of cancellations by Paul Smith, Clements Ribeiro, Katharine Hamnett and Burberry. Jasper Conran set the tone by issuing a defiant statement of intent, saying the ""objectives of terrorism are not only to kill but also to disrupt. … It is not our intention to allow these people to prevail by bowing out of … our responsibility … to our industry and democracy.""</p><p>Conran followed with a collection that reflects the taste of the heartland of Tony Blair's new Britain—accessible, understandable dressing for grown-ups who haven't forgotten how to flirt. Working with pimento, black and white, he incorporated subtle '30s and '40s references into silk polka-dot dresses and blouses, sharpened by tailoring, sometimes in napa.</p><p>At his best, Conran proves himself a worthy successor to Jean Muir, whose remit was always beautiful jersey cut for Brit sophisticates. The element of slinkiness in his sinuous black jersey dresses showed him at the top of his form, proving why he is one of London's most commercial designers: Aside from this collection, he reaches the whole of Britain through 96 branches of the Debenhams department store, for whom he designs extensive ranges under the label ""J.""</p></div>"
56,spring,2002,s2002,jean-paul-gaultier,"Buddhist-monk chic? In Jean Paul Gaultier's ethnic potpourri of a world, the concept is not only possible—it's inevitable.</p><p>With serene models wafting onstage in extralong skirts, draped tops and flowing dresses with trains that doubled as wraps, Gaultier brought India to the Carrousel du Louvre. Skillfully blending eastern and western influences, the designer deconstructed masculine suiting to create a three-tiered silhouette of sharp blazers, skirt overlays and straight trousers. Best of all were his sunny ruffled skirts and ruched dresses, which radiated positive energy.</p><p>""I've always been inspired by different cultures, and I discovered that in Buddhism orange is the color of peace and liberty,"" said Gaultier backstage. ""I wanted to convey a positive message of global communion."" He succeeded.</p></div>"
57,spring,2002,s2002,jil-sander,"More than a year after parting with its eponymous designer, Jil Sander is still struggling to find its footing as a world-class designer label.</p><p>Milan Vukmirovic, who was appointed creative director of the house less than a year ago, provided a tepid follow-up to his Fall debut. While there were several perfectly proper, wearable pieces—a great woven-leather coat, sharply cut blazers and a smart little caftan dress with flat sandals—the overall mood of the show was that of a nonevent. Vukmirovic's leather chemises and evening halter dresses, all in muted tones, failed to convey a strong sense of emotion.</p><p>Successful minimalist design requires an extremely precise sense of rigor, one that the Jil Sander design team must carefully pinpoint in order to maintain their status as a news-making brand.</p></div>"
58,spring,2002,s2002,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart has a knack for zeroing in on the prevailing fashion trends and then translating them into affordable clothes that her youthful clientele can understand.</p><p>For Spring, Stuart played up several of last season's key themes. Bohemian romanticism was much in evidence, via flowing, embroidered robes, gauzy washed-cotton dresses, wide-knit shawls, multi-tiered, ruffled skirts, and large, fringed bags that could have been found on the set of <em>Almost Famous</em>. With distressed cotton jackets and puff-sleeve shirts, Stuart also picked up on the street-cool look that Marc Jacobs has honed with his Marc line, throwing in bondage pants and cut-off utility shorts for good measure.</p><p>What else could one possibly add to the mix? Stuart went for wide, metallic belts, and flat sandals with impossibly long, scalloped straps that crisscrossed their way up to the models' knees.</p></div>"
59,spring,2002,s2002,joe-casely-hayford,"The mere fact that Joe Casely-Hayford has had a 15-year career in London makes him some kind of a national veteran—certainly considering all those who have been in and out of business during that time. His beat has always been easy, naive clothes with an off-kilter, homespun charm, and the look still has an appealing freshness and lack of pretension.</p><p>Casely-Hayford's Spring 2002 collection, called ""Pretty Hard,"" incorporates puff-sleeve blouses, skirts with layered ruffles, and vests with cow horns studded on the back, all in a South American, tobacco-and-sand palette. While everything looks natural and almost homemade, the designer says he's working with luxury, high-tech fabric that is ""made to look low-tech""—like a pair of hand-painted smock dresses, in a mix of cotton and silk, that ended his show.</p></div>"
60,spring,2002,s2002,john-galliano,"Once again, John Galliano staged an extravagant ethnic mishmash.</p><p>An imposing checkered snakeskin zoot suit paved the way for Mexican-beaded shirts and suits, wide denim ensembles embroidered with cars, and a great knitted Andean coat. Galliano also showed some beautiful quieter pieces that were sometimes eclipsed by the flashier outfits: Standouts included a piped pale-blue blazer, side-ruched trousers and pretty tea dresses. (These could have done without their bungee-cord multiloop belts.)</p><p>Galliano is a fantastic storyteller who can meld diverse influences like few others. The insistence with which he drives this point home, however, is making it virtually impossible to distinguish his work at Dior from that of his signature line.</p></div>"
61,spring,2002,s2002,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald has joined the ranks of designers who must work two collections in two countries—a daunting task, even for some of fashion's top talents. Unsurprising, then, that signs of strain were evident in Macdonald's first collection for his own label since taking up his post at Givenchy just a few months ago.</p><p>Macdonald's show, staged in the London Science Museum, looked as if a sudden awareness of posh European fashion had descended and smothered the designer's usual brash clubbiness. References to haute Parisian fashion were all too visible—the tooled leather belts and cargo pockets Tom Ford has used; the Givenchy-esque Bettina blouse; the heavy, couturelike flowered satin; the Versace-flavor spangly minidress. Even Macdonald's own signature asymmetric near-naked disco dresses misfired, at a time when the validity of good-time clothes suddenly looks very questionable.</p><p>As a relative unknown outside London, Macdonald will have to work harder to show a world audience the difference between his hometown collection and Givenchy. Still, Alexander McQueen struggled to find his feet at Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs took several seasons to warm up at Louis Vuitton, while their own labels have occasionally wobbled under the workload. So give the boy time.</p></div>"
62,spring,2002,s2002,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli knows her customer well: hip, downtown girls who appreciate the trends but would never dream of looking like overeager fashion victims.</p><p>Adeli’s collection was focused and to the point. Black fringe tanks worn with super-skinny eyelet jeans are sure to turn up on customers’ most-wanted lists; ditto for the hand-tooled leather jackets and wide low-slung belts. Gunmetal silk jersey tops, frayed trousers and crepe dresses with sheer insets were all sexy and modern. When it looked like the collection could veer toward the predictable, Adeli wisely softened her street-tough silhouette with billowy, oversized tops, fringed cowgirl vests and casual batik skirts.</p><p>Like other designers, Adeli touched upon the Victorian and peasant aesthetics that Balenciaga and Saint Laurent have made so popular this fall, but she managed to move beyond obvious references to create an identity of her own.</p></div>"
63,spring,2002,s2002,lawrence-steele,"Known for his love of simple luxury, Lawrence Steele turned up the volume this season with a collection that evoked the formfitting sexiness of old-school Hollywood.</p><p>Steele relied on severe pencil skirts, flared at the knee, and strapless gowns to create an ultra-curvaceous silhouette. Fifties-inspired dresses swished with every turn, while stretch tops anchored large floral-print skirts. For evening, Steele turned to leopard-spot beading; his tuxedo featured a blinding gold sequin vest in lieu of a conventional shirt. Steele indulged his sense of humor by embroidering a large, cursive ""L"" (last seen on '70s sitcom <em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em>) on loose cardigans that are meant to be worn backward.</p><p>Not everything worked, however. Several of Steele's ruched skirts and dresses looked simply old-fashioned, and there were times when the self-conscious glamour was laid on too thick. An occasional touch of restraint would have been welcome.</p></div>"
64,spring,2002,s2002,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs could not have chosen a better note with which to close the Spring 2002 collections—his Louis Vuitton show perfectly captured the dreamy, romantic aesthetic that has dominated the season.</p><p>One of the many feats Jacobs pulled off was to make snakeskin soft and demure. His gently scalloped silver python skirts and cropped jackets conveyed not a hint of aggression, while a delicate snake trim also surfaced on a mini-suit and several perky dresses. Elsewhere, Jacobs offered some of the best peasant dresses around—A-lined, swimming with delicate paisley prints, and grazing the floor. The same silhouette was used for the empire washed denim robes, which gave the humble fabric an air of grandeur. Lamé jackets with naif embroideries are just the thing to throw over any of these superb dresses.</p><p>This is clearly the season to invest in Louis Vuitton accessories. After the street-inspired (and by now ubiquitous) graffiti totes, what better change of pace than a sweet butterfly, mouse or winking owl bag?</p></div>"
65,spring,2002,s2002,luella,"It seems that prairie girls are here to stay, at least according to Luella Bartley, who decamped to New York this season. To a blaring soundtrack that included everything from “Sweet Home Alabama” to “Get Ur Freak On,” the London designer sent out a cavalcade of country gals decked out in trailblazer skirts, embroidered dresses, off-the-shoulder tops, frayed denim skirts, and Navajo-inspired wrap coats in vivid colors.</p><p>The American West motif eventually gave way to an array of candy-colored looks that included a playful pink-and-blue striped blazer, a piped rose sundress and several bright yellow knits that will be just the thing for a summer weekend in Malibu. Bartley’s accessories also hit the mark: The outrageous combination of Pocahontas leather socks, pink cowgirl boots, wide-brim floppy hats, multicolored woven belts with streamers (courtesy of Katie Hillier), dangling fur tails and feather embellishments somehow managed to make perfect sense.</p><p>If the audience’s gaze occasionally strayed off the runway, don’t blame Bartley. The sight of Venus and Serena Williams in the front row, the next day after their historic U.S. Open match, proved too much for most to resist.</p></div>"
66,spring,2002,s2002,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The fun, practical, mix-and-matchable clothes in Marc Jacobs' junior line are fast making it a style beacon for hip, plugged-in girls around the country.</p><p>Jacobs steers clear of female fashion stereotypes: Marc is not about debutantes, punk princesses or cheerleaders, but about cool girls who follow their own rules. Urban warriors will go for a shrunken, revamped military jacket or an army-green, eyelet-hook parka; retro babes will prefer the fruit-colored tops and folksy smocks; California girls can't go wrong with shorts, rainbow-striped jeans and flimsy knit tops.</p><p>Still only in its third season, Marc continues to grow by leaps and bounds. For Spring 2002 there are flirty floral bikinis, more accessories than ever, and jeans and sweatshirts for boys. Large denim totes, striped lace-up wedges, butterfly platforms and canvas sneakers make the perfect exclamation points for these energetic looks.</p></div>"
67,spring,2002,s2002,marc-jacobs,"After Marc Jacobs' high-powered presentation, it's official: Spring is all about color. Designers are staging a backlash against fall's somber mood, and Jacobs is spearheading it.</p><p>Using a long pier off Manhattan's Meatpacking District as his runway, Jacobs presented what is sure to become one of the season's most influential collections. Lilac shirts, marigold pants, dandelion sweaters, and sweet tulip-print dresses brought to mind a Berkeley student listening to Donovan or the Strawberry Alarm Clock in the late sixties—if flower children had ever displayed such a witty way with proportions and chromatic combinations. Mack-daddy suits with wide lapels, plenty of topstitching, and generous bell-bottoms were worn with pale plum shirts; a folksy collage jacket was trimmed with vivid printed bands and paired with a blueberry suede skirt. Rainbow jersey dresses, floral-print halters, and petal-embroidered shirts were simultaneously sweet and mischievous.</p><p>When the show ended to thunderous applause, a faux backstage wall magically parted, allowing guests like Sarah Jessica Parker, Gretchen Mol, Hilary Swank, Lisa Marie, Donald Trump, and Monica Lewinsky to venture into the backroom. Jacobs had created an elaborate party space overlooking the Hudson River, complete with grass-covered floors, picnic tables overflowing with fresh fruit, and even a fire boat that sprayed jets of water in the distance.</p></div>"
68,spring,2002,s2002,markus-lupfer,"The things to watch at Markus Lupfer are his twists on leather and print. This German-born designer, who trained with Clements Ribeiro, has gathered a following among editors and shoppers alike for designs that are interesting, without ever making a girl look like a freak.</p><p>This show was high on femininity, color and detail. Lupfer opened with a flouncy skirt and sleeveless top decorated with vibrantly colored and patterned paperwork, like something derived from a South American carnival. It wasn't a costume parade, though: He followed up with photo-printed cashmeres and blouses, and intricately pieced superfine leather skirts and dresses cut and made so cleverly they almost looked like fabric. Some all-white looks—right down to belts and sneakers—hit a general Summer trend, while Aertex popped up again as a fabric of the moment.</p><p>When Spring comes around, Lupfer's collection will be a place to snap up a few frills and some nice color, plus—new to him this season—belts, bags and shoes.</p></div>"
69,spring,2002,s2002,marni,"Marni designer Consuelo Castiglioni turned out a timely, finely tuned collection with a folksy, romantic feel.</p><p>Castiglioni began with her most ambitiously layered looks, then gradually pared them down as if to allow the audience to take in the abundance of details. Few labels can pull off mismatched prints better than Marni; here, striped trousers and low-slung girly skirts stood out under sweet floral tops decorated with silver paillettes. Bright blazers, frayed-edge jackets, and a great mink vest that can be reduced to half its length with the pull of a zipper all looked just right. Nomadic fashionistas, meanwhile, will be drawn to Castiglioni's large, low-slung bags laden with pins, rhinestones, dangling chains and furry tails.</p><p>Milan's news of the day: For the first time ever, Castiglioni showed several carefully crafted men's looks, providing a relaxed alternative to the strict tailoring that has dominated most recent menswear collections.</p></div>"
70,spring,2002,s2002,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon draws on an eclectic mix of sources and has consistently explored both feminized menswear and a vintage, flea-market aesthetic.</p><p>It was hardly surprising, then, when antique-looking camisoles, washed denim skirts and distressed ruffle dresses all turned up on her runway, often coupled with mannish pinstripe blazers or vests. While several individual pieces worked well—notably the ecru coats, aged suede jackets and slim trousers—the overall effect of this collection was one of frenetic aimlessness. Sitbon's straightforward jabot dresses, Edwardian smocks and velvet-trimmed bits of flounce slipped too easily into the realm of kitsch. It's one thing to reference and update the past, but quite another to look like you're on your way to a costume party.</p></div>"
71,spring,2002,s2002,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson dubbed his concise, feel-good collection ""Nu-topia,"" evoking the sort of acid-house resort—think Ibiza, Goa or Phuket—where girls (and boys this season) just want to have fun.</p><p>""Today you are panthers,"" read the backstage instructions board for the models, ""sleek, strong, sexy."" In fact, his girls were more fragile than predatory, in fluttering chiffon handkerchief point dresses and tops, ombré-printed with fluorescent rainbow colors. Skintight denim jeans (worn with Christian Louboutin's coin-fringed disco sandals) were patched with quirky assemblages of golden lace and neon-bright butterfly appliqués; even All Star baseball boots were customized with embroidered patchworks made from scraps of antique Maltese lace. (Backstage, the designer was wearing a length as a necktie.)</p><p>Fringed ponchos, micro-minis, patchwork elephant-leg jeans and shredded silky knits may not have been the freshest fashion news, but Williamson's elaborate detailing and neon palette (with white, gold and bleached blue) made them very much his own. ""I thought it was fantastic—The End,"" squeaked It girl and Rolling Stones scion Leah Woods.</p></div>"
72,spring,2002,s2002,michael-kors-collection,"""I really appreciate the fact that we have all come together,"" said a newly mustachioed Michael Kors before his showroom presentation. ""Let's be cheerleaders for all that New York has to offer, because this is the most amazing city in the world.""</p><p>Kors' positive outlook was evident in a concise collection that brought to mind the best of Halston, with an injection of movie-star glamour (his update on the giant tie-strap tote bag is destined to become a collectible). Alongside beachy getaway clothes, more sophisticated urban looks included chinoiserie-inspired red lacquer cardigans and sweatshirts, georgette halter dresses, and brush-stroke skirts (upon close inspection, some of the abstract prints proved to be expressionist MK logos). Evening took a turn for the dramatic with slinky bandeau columns and stunning black-and-gold embroidered tulle shells and shifts.</p><p>Kors' practical yet lighthearted collection struck a chord that is likely to resonate throughout this season.</p></div>"
73,spring,2002,s2002,miguel-adrover,"Over the past year, Miguel Adrover has traveled several times to Egypt, bringing back with him images of flowing djellabas, loose harem pants and floor-length monastic skirts. For Spring, Adrover continued to explore Middle Eastern-inspired themes with everything from ornate skirts embellished with tassels and leather waistbands, to colorful patchwork wraps and skirts quilted with elaborate lattice patterns. Long, delicately printed desert dresses were worn under strict colonial blazers, and trouser suits were pegged at the ankle.</p><p>The ethnic journey began with serene, austere peasant tunics, but eventually gave way to a crescendo of primary colors. A tongue-in-cheek Jamaican-themed segment consisted of red, black, yellow and green suits; a long column gown was painted with an extraordinary Middle Eastern vista. Model Oluchi, enveloped in layers of multihued chiffon, resembled a nomadic tribal goddess.</p><p>Adrover's collection was very beautiful—and, as usual, long and uncompromising. Not everything will be for everyone, but at a time when cookie-cutter fashion is increasingly commonplace, Adrover’s independent spirit is more relevant than ever.</p></div>"
74,spring,2002,s2002,missoni,"With fashion designers turning to the hippie-dippy '60s and '70s for inspiration, Missoni's bold contrasting prints are enjoying a moment in the sun.</p><p>Missoni put a decadent, luxurious spin on folksy romanticism. Handkerchief tops were printed to resemble tie-dye treatments; Native American-inspired embellishments adorned jacket sleeves, carrier bags and the back of a raw tab-collar coat. A fluorescent acrylic palette of yellow and cobalt blue referenced early Bob Dylan style, as did the shredded-patchwork and loom-net skirts, shawl tops and butterfly trousers.</p><p>Missoni's eveningwear dazzled with metallic, optic swirl dresses sporting fringed hems. Baby-doll frocks, silver beaded tops and extrawide copper trousers will all look great with high-heeled espadrilles—the footwear of choice for Missoni bohemians.</p></div>"
75,spring,2002,s2002,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada was in a romantic, youthful mood at Miu Miu, updating the prairie themes that have been so popular on other runways.</p><p>Miu Miu's take on home-on-the-range dressing was livened up by delicate ethnic touches—like Moroccan-inspired embroidery on full-bodied, pleated skirts that dance at the knee. Long, tiered skirts make the transition from country to city style when worn with peppy floral button-downs and smart little cardigans. At times, things got just a little too girly—it's hard to imagine anyone past 16 wearing a Little Red Riding Hood smock with gathered short sleeves. On the other hand, there were plenty of simpler, breezier camisoles that will work as chic, simple Summer staples.</p><p>For the practically minded, Prada included an assortment of sensible pantsuits and boyish blazers—perfect for a new generation of career girls.</p></div>"
76,spring,2002,s2002,moschino,"Designer Vincent Dare, who until recently worked at Fendi, has taken over the reigns at Moschino, presenting one of the most spirited collections that label has seen in years.</p><p>Humor has always been a key ingredient at Moschino, and Dare made the most of it. Iconic '80s Chanel diva Inès de la Fressange opened the show, wearing a whimsical reinterpretation of the signature Chanel bouclé suit. The T-shirt underneath, meanwhile, was printed with a haughty put-down from Karl Lagerfeld: ""Moschino n'est pas un style, c'est un pastiche!"" As a riposte, Dare then introduced some great ruffled skirts, lightly beaded caftans, and a great horizontal-pleat dress that had gold coins nestled within the folds. Other urban suggestions included sharp pantsuits with ribbon detailing, a paillette-trimmed trench, and a crumpled tux that looked like it had been pulled prematurely from the dryer.</p><p>Playfully recalling Moschino's prominence in the '80s, Dare also sent ex-models Lynn Koester and Violeta Sanchez down the runway. They clearly enjoyed their comeback cameos.</p></div>"
77,spring,2002,s2002,narciso-rodriguez,"In the world of Narciso Rodriguez, ""trendy"" is a dirty word. Avoiding gimmickry at all costs, Rodriguez relies on precise cutting and obsessive attention to detail to create a minimal—and lasting—elegance.</p><p>With a nod, perhaps, to the almost ritualistic pleasure of getting dressed, Rodriguez showed cotton toile jackets and poplin cutout dresses fastened by rows of tiny eyelet hooks. His version of the classic white shirt was carefully seamed and paneled, turning it, in effect, into a light, fitted jacket. Transparency and layering were important themes: a crepe de chine U-neck dress really came to life when a wrap skirt was thrown over it. Rodriguez's most dramatic statement was a stunning glass tube short-sleeve dress, which seemed to reflect every light in the room.</p><p>Anyone blessed with an accessories fetish knows that Rodriguez is currently producing some of the best shoes around. This season's sky-high, pointy ankle-strap stilettos are his best yet.</p></div>"
78,spring,2002,s2002,olivier-theyskens,"Although Olivier Theyskens has always been inspired by history, particularly the Victorian era, he uses old techniques to create clothes that are thoroughly, dramatically new.</p><p>Theysken's elaborate evening statements, in bold colors like electric green, orange crush and canary yellow, were feats of construction that incorporated imperiously ruffled, asymmetric skirts and cinched eyelet-hook corsets with a tiny shirt attached at the front. A brushed leather coat came with a bustled back, but did not look out of place among the more conventional trenches. In fact, Theyskens maintained a light, balanced mood throughout, showing sharp basics like light polo knits, a stunning gold silk skirt, and even a series of humble everyday cotton dresses.</p><p>This was a precisely conceived, consistent collection that will only further Theyskens' growing reputation.</p></div>"
79,spring,2002,s2002,oscar-de-la-renta,"Oscar de la Renta began his condensed showroom presentation by distributing American-flag armbands to editors and buyers, and making sure models wore them with his outfits.</p><p>De la Renta's vibrant, positive collection was focused on daintily embroidered linen dresses, printed silk camisoles and gypsy-like ruffled skirts. Dreamy silk muslin petal dresses, officers' khaki cotton jackets and a striking palm-print jumpsuit brought to mind the tropical chic of colonial Indochine—by way of the Beverly Hills Hotel. For evening, eyelet blouses were paired with big, dramatic tulle skirts and accessorized with diamond-trimmed satin sandals. A double-faced charmeuse tuxedo with a white linen blouse was strikingly chic in its simplicity.</p><p>""When I started designing clothes I was full of spirit and passion,"" said the Dominican-born de la Renta. ""Today, 35 years later, that joy is still there. I am glad that I came to this country and happy to be an American.""</p></div>"
80,spring,2002,s2002,philosophy,"Philosophy, Alberta Ferretti's junior line, is known for its ethereal, delicate dresses. This season, however, Ferretti imbued her lightweight frocks with a decidedly street-tough edge.</p><p>Not that there was any shortage of Ferretti's signature embellishments: In fact, practically every look seemed awash in pleats and ruffles. But the designer cut her smocks and skirts extra wide, employed neutral colors, and styled them with Mad Max verve. (Ferretti's models usually waft onto the runway; this time, they stomped in and out at breakneck speed.) Unfinished tops peeked out from cropped, ribbed cardigans; laser-cut details spruced up long, casual skirts. A frayed, pleated pale rose dress with an asymmetric hem could be just the thing a young urban warrior would want to throw on to combat a summer heat wave.</p><p>For those in search of a practical dress with plenty of attitude, Philosophy is certainly one place to turn.</p></div>"
81,spring,2002,s2002,prada,"Combining '50s notions of jet-set elegance with couturelike fabrics and exquisite ethnic references, Miuccia Prada triumphantly opened Milan fashion week.</p><p>Set to a dreamy instrumental soundtrack, Prada's show began with tailored navy skirts, trousers with built-in, low-slung belts, silvery lattice-print shirts, and kittenish Sabrina heels. Then came an exquisite homage to vintage Chanel, with belted, gold-threaded bouclé dresses—just the kind of stunning little outfits Romy Schneider would have sported in the early '60s. Prada's pajama-style chemises with Turkish motifs projected nonchalant, understated chic; the pin-tucked frilly tops and skirts trimmed with a vertical ruffle strip referenced fashion's infatuation with all things romantic, but steered clear of clichés.</p><p>As usual, Prada saved the best for last. In contrast to the dour palette that many designers have adopted lately, her runway positively dazzled. Nude tops and dresses were layered with lightweight, shimmering knits; paneled, imposing skirts glowed under crinkled gold tops and coppery brocade jackets. The result? A vision of bygone splendor that never devolved into gratuitous flash.</p></div>"
82,spring,2002,s2002,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren capitalized on fashion's current infatuation with Americana, mixing and matching romantic home-on-the-range elements with more rugged, vintage-inspired pieces.</p><p>Playing with white, sand and ivory, Lauren went for small, fitted jackets and low-rise, boot-cut trousers; flirty ruffles softened up blouses and long, full skirts. Shawls and ponchos surfaced in various forms: dramatically fringed, tied around the waist and embroidered with an assortment of flowers. Lauren did not, however, neglect his customers' need for everyday urban simplicity—his essential pantsuit came in beige wool gabardine with handpicked detailing. An ivory silk charmeuse pant and jacket ensemble provided a relaxed spin on the tuxedo.</p><p>Highlights of the collection included a beaded, scalloped camisole paired with natural deerskin jeans, and the combination of an embroidered tulle skirt, white linen shirt and distressed leather jacket that closed his show.</p></div>"
83,spring,2002,s2002,richard-edwards,"Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick, who together make up the label Richard Edwards, are clearly not about flash. They rely on precision of cut and careful details to make their confident, urban clothes.</p><p>Flounces and ruffles have been practically everywhere this season, and Bengtsson and Pavlick used some of these decorative elements in the most discreet way possible. Single ruffled trims inched their way up the side of straight trousers or around the neckline of functional, sleeveless tanks. Silk piping, satin insets and string laces dressed up everything from sexy pantsuits to understated shift dresses, while shoulder cutouts lent a touch of cool to casual everyday tops.</p><p>Bengtsson and Pavlick's minimalism extended to the show's styling. See-through ballet slippers carefully matched the outfits' muted tones, while the simple ponytails and nude makeup worn by the models ensured that nothing distracted from the clothes.</p></div>"
84,spring,2002,s2002,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli closed Milan fashion week with his customary over-the-top bravura display.</p><p>""A modern fairy tale"" was how Cavalli described his sexy, folky collection. Laser-cut leather jackets and maxi coats were aged and distressed, as were his shirred, flouncy dresses, lace micro-skirts and hyper-decorated jeans. Cavalli's beloved leopard and floral prints turned up on baroque inlaid chiffons, silks and muslins; his show-stopping evening gowns could pass as couture lingerie, with their profusion of decadent embroideries, cutouts and trimmings.</p><p>Before taking his bow, Cavalli sent out a procession of short—but equally arresting—dresses. Think of them as a slightly more approachable introduction to the designer's high-intensity, maximal vision.</p></div>"
85,spring,2002,s2002,roland-mouret,"A Frenchman working in London, Roland Mouret combines the romance of the couture tradition with the grit of his adopted city to make beautiful, edgy eveningwear.</p><p>Mouret kept his audience spellbound with a collection of black asymmetric dresses, falling from the body in rivulets of fabric, contrasted with shots of sharp, gentlemanly suiting. Upping the romantic quotient was the look of the girls, who wore no-makeup makeup with a slightly fevered sheen and ever-so-slightly tousled hair, as if caught at 3 a.m. at some fantastic ball. Luxury was also in plentiful supply: Mouret has the real thing, in the form of a new collection of rough diamond jewelry, made in association with mining company Oryx. The signature pins Mouret has always used to anchor fabric in a dress are now capped with a sugar-cube-size chunk of raw ice, while pendants and wisps of silver bracelets swing with very serious rocks. Show-stoppers? A dusty pink, huge-sleeved georgette blouse tethered to the torso with a massive wooden bead necklace; a delicate layered sheath of chiffon in cutout black flowers; and a white corseted top with a 3-D, raw-edged bouquet of fabric flowering at one shoulder.</p><p>If there are to be occasions in the future, these are the kind of clothes clued-up women will dream of wearing to them.</p></div>"
86,spring,2002,s2002,ruffo-research,"Since launching their Research line in 1998, which is entrusted to a different designer every year, Ruffo Research has become an important talent scout in Milan. This season, Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, who have already made a name for themselves with the playful collections they’ve designed under their signature label, Alexandre Matthieu, brought an infusion of lighthearted energy to the Ruffo runway.</p><p>Treating leather like fabric, the duo sent out punched-suede camisoles, perky little suits trimmed with delicate buckles, and great shift dresses with dangling chrysanthemum cutouts. The pièce de résistance was a distressed leather-strip skirt, which swished and sashayed as if it were pleated chiffon. Bureau and Morgado also devised a logo for the brand, in the form of glittery R’s that turned up on dresses and shirts.</p><p>In the past, Ruffo Research has employed talents as diverse as Antonio Berardi, Raf Simons and Veronique Branquinho, An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, and Sophia Kokosalaki. With fashion editors and clients constantly on the hunt for new ideas, the Ruffo team clearly understands that promoting innovation is not only desirable, but in some cases absolutely necessary.</p></div>"
87,spring,2002,s2002,russell-sage,"Russell Sage puts his collections together by reworking antique pieces to incorporate symbolic commentaries. This one started with a tableau of four models in short-sleeve cotton dresses with animal skins draped over them. (The show notes pointed out that the zebras and tigers on display had been shot in the 1880s and '90s.) These were followed by more dresses onto which oil paintings of John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney and Julien Macdonald had been sewn. Today's big-game trophies are fashion labels—geddit?</p><p>Sage's quip didn't exactly rock the aisles, but his show had plenty of other treasures worth looking at—all made from a haul of Victorian patchwork, hunting jackets, embroidered Chinese silk and vintage nightshirts. Underneath the asymmetrical complexities, the color and shape of the dresses—often done with intricate pleating and a romantic full-skirted silhouette—was beautiful. Standouts were the designer's neat, short evening jackets, especially one in antique damask with a black organza ruffle bursting from a lapel. It's a compliment to Sage that, despite the heritage fabrics, this looks like a believable modern collection rather than a costume show.</p></div>"
88,spring,2002,s2002,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford was in fine form at Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, sending out his most laid-back, relaxed collection to date.</p><p>The big news was the arrival—finally—of prints at YSL Rive Gauche, in the form of leopard spots. Ford paired sheer little feline tanks with rustic leather skirts dissected by minute rows of crisscrossed laces; this folksy embellishment also turned up on road-warrior trousers, sexy swimsuits and a fabulous ecru trench. Ring-studded leather jackets, unfinished suede skirts and rough-edge coats looked drop-dead cool with stacked heel sandals and large, half-oval carrier bags.</p><p>Come spring, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche evenings will be all about unassuming glamour. Ford's new golden leopard caftan robes are worthy of the queen of the jungle—just the thing for a night of decadent mischief.</p></div>"
89,spring,2002,s2002,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel is synonymous with elegant, typically French clothes, and this season was no exception.</p><p>Rykiel started out with a couple of lean black jackets tucked into high-waist trousers, but quickly moved on to her beloved trompe-l'oeil sweaters embroidered to look like smokings or sailor uniforms; others spelled out words like <em>diamant</em> or <em>rubis</em> in glittering paillettes. Other fun-loving basics included lollipop-colored frilly dresses, striped poplin skirts and sporty everyday jackets. Rykiel's asymmetric evening dresses featured lingerie-inspired lace trims; her crumpled hooded jackets, shirts and trousers were held together with utility belts that had built-in cases which doubled as little flower pots.</p><p>Rykiel's bathing suits were some of the most original of the season. Her black bikinis and one-piece maillots were dangerously sheer, with strategically placed striped insets.</p></div>"
90,spring,2002,s2002,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki knows exactly who she is and what she is about. An Athenian working in London, it has taken her just a few seasons to develop a consistently strong, feminine aesthetic.</p><p>Kokosalaki turned to her Mediterranean roots for the first time this Summer in a collection she described as ""Minoan Pagan""—a reference to the ancient Cretan civilization of King Minos. Specific influences were the terra cotta, tan and creamy colors of Cretan wall-painting and ceramics, and the cheesecloth and macramé of Greek peasant crafts. These were incorporated into her already distinctive way with leather (delicately twisted and embroidered bustiers and seamed jackets) and draped jersey (dresses with cobwebby inserts at the front, or slung about with dangly macramé belts).</p><p>Another new element was intricate pleating, which looked great on the bodice of the best piece in the collection: a high-waisted cheesecloth peasant dress with a keyhole opening, piped in cream.</p></div>"
91,spring,2002,s2002,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney’s debut collection after leaving Chloé fell far short of expectations.</p><p>McCartney’s flashy, boisterous parade featured risqué slogans, sometimes in Cockney rhyming slang, printed on practically all of her looks. An almost pornographic dress read “Slippery When Wet;” cropped T-shirts had “Raspberry Ripple” scribbled across the chest; a long coat encouraged observers to “Spank the Monkey.” Apart from these artless wannabe shockers, McCartney offered uninspired electric blue sequined pieces, mini-slips with trailing sleeves, and dresses with dotted-face designs courtesy of artist Gary Hume.</p><p>Although some of McCartney’s T-shirts and accessories (like the hard “Wet” case) could be commercially viable, her show clearly did not live up to the technical and creative standards expected of a major Gucci Group label.</p></div>"
92,spring,2002,s2002,strenesse,"Layering was the key to Gabriele Strehle's finely tuned Strenesse collection, an exercise in minimalist luxury.</p><p>Strehle began with large, crisp white shirts that doubled as short dresses, upon which she piled comforting cashmere jumpers and cropped cardigans, almost like layers of luxurious shielding. Leggings and high-waist pants made brief appearances, but for the most part it was the oversize jackets with drawstrings, asymmetric-hem sweater dresses and tunic-like chemises that stole the show. A muted palette of white, ecru, navy and black emphasized a loose, casual silhouette that was anchored with no-nonsense flat boots.</p><p>Strehle's understated aesthetic extended to her evening dresses: short, gathered Empire slips that look as comfortable as they are chic.</p></div>"
93,spring,2002,s2002,tomas-maier,"Most women spend a lot of time putting together their basic urban outfits—suits, party dresses and weekend staples—but leave shopping for that last-minute beach getaway until, well, the last minute.</p><p>Enter Tomas Maier, the German designer who has made a career out of treating swimwear just as seriously as any other component of a woman's wardrobe. Maier's sexy swimsuits range from itsy-bitsy, fire-engine-red bikinis to black, figure-flattering one-piece suits, and are decorated with everything from a rogue flower to lavish fringe. To cover the ground between beach and hotel, Maier provides silk jersey cover-ups and caftans, sensible track suits, shorts and tees.</p><p>""My clothes are designed exclusively for moments of leisure,"" says Maier. ""There are bathing suits, comfortable things for the plane, and even a little something to open the door when you order room service.""</p></div>"
94,spring,2002,s2002,ungaro-couture,"For the first time since establishing his eponymous fashion house in 1965, Emanuel Ungaro did not take a bow at the end of his show. Monsieur Ungaro has left his ready-to-wear line in the hands of creative director Giambattista Valli, and will now be directly responsible only for couture.</p><p>Valli's first effort was heavy on high-glamour '80s references. Trousers were baggy and pegged, jeans were covered in tulle, and jersey dresses were lavished with cascades of crystal pearls or printed with faces that could have been pulled from the pages of <em>Vogue</em>. It was the simpler pieces, however, that worked best. Valli's linen pantsuits and delicately embroidered muslin dresses, for example, were far more subtle and convincing than his awkward corset ensembles.</p><p>Valli has worked with Ungaro for several seasons now, and has taken important steps to update the label. With a bit more time, he should be able to hit a comfortable, consistent stride.</p></div>"
95,spring,2002,s2002,valentino,"A rich vein of Latin American glamour ran throughout Valentino's Spring collection, which was heavily decorated with ruffles, folksy embroidery and waist-nipping corset belts.</p><p>The designer's strong palette revolved around black, with flashes of banana, coral, aqua and lipstick red. But the emphasis was clearly on the silhouette, notably in some truly elaborate, beautiful pieces like smocked taffeta dresses with beaded georgette shawls, romantic chiffon tops and long skirts accented with turquoise and salmon embroidery. A shocking pink coat, worn with a ruffled shirt and shantung trousers, was in the best Valentino tradition.</p><p>As usual, the designer saved his best for after 5. (This is, after all, the man who dressed Julia Roberts for her Oscar victory and Jennifer Lopez for her recent wedding.) Come red-carpet time, celebrity stylists will have no trouble finding plenty of scene-making gowns. Standouts? A black georgette column with bows; the combination of a ruffle-front ivory shirt and a high-waist fire-engine taffeta skirt with lace inserts; and a shirred tulle Aleutian extravaganza.</p></div>"
96,spring,2002,s2002,vera-wang,"Few designers can match Vera Wang's command of discreet sophistication. In addition to producing ready-to-wear collections and running a made-to-order atelier, she has recently completed a substantial coffee-table book answering every possible question one could have about planning a wedding.</p><p>Wang is all about couture-like elegance. While there's nothing here in the way of sensible everyday separates, there are perfect little black dresses—one short georgette number has a ruffled skirt and a detachable bolero jacket; another, with cutout shoulders, is gently cinched at one side—and some very serious full evening looks. Among the best were a floor-length halter gown with fishtail hems and a long column with elastic leather straps.</p><p>There's no shortage of color in this collection, either, thanks to some stunning cocktail dresses in frothy, fruity shades. Standouts? The melon slip with a jeweled lace border and the printed chiffon halter with sequin fringe dangling from the neckline to the floor and around the waist.</p></div>"
97,spring,2002,s2002,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho was at her best for Spring, creating the kind of precisely conceived clothes that defy flash-in-the-pan trends to achieve classic status.</p><p>This is a designer who can make basics—prim, proper blazers paired with masculine white shirts and sharply creased trousers—look exceptional, thanks to her fastidious sense of proportion and color. Even that much reviled '80s staple, the acid-washed jean, looked dignified here, paired with a sharp jacket and glittery white pumps. A street-smart, no-nonsense parka was given an intriguing twist thanks to a tunnel belt and drawstring hem, while Branquinho's unassuming skirts and dresses, with their gentle pleats and asymmetric panels, were often belted nonchalantly with a wide men's tie.</p><p>Branquinho is one of those rare talents who can make the quietest statements speak volumes.</p></div>"
98,spring,2002,s2002,versace,"Newlywed Jennifer Lopez caused a major paparazzi meltdown at Versace as she wafted onto the multihued runway in a pearl-gray goddess gown that clung to her every curve.</p><p>Versace's collection could have been designed specifically for Lopez and her fellow members of the red-hot diva society. Severely form-fitting silhouettes in striking blues, violets and reds were the norm. The focus was on sensual details like rows of circular cutouts, lace-up closures and deep-plunging backs; fire-engine-red skirts were dotted with minute eyelets, while leather tops and grommet-trimmed dresses laced up provocatively in the back. Several eggshell suits and dresses provided a momentary chromatic respite before Donatella plunged into a series of pop-print floral dresses that could have sprung from a Warhol canvas. For evening there were low-waisted skirts with shimmering net overlays, embroidered tops, and a no-holds-barred beaded pink column.</p><p>To celebrate Lopez's wedding, Donatella threw a dinner bash at her Lake Como house, half an hour outside of Milan—the perfect conclusion to her high-octane presentation.</p></div>"
99,spring,2002,s2002,versus-versace,"Donatella Versace served up plenty of defiant attitude at Versus—just the kind of thing to delight fans like Lil' Kim, who was perched in her front-row seat wearing a barely-there miniskirt, curled blond locks and tall leather boots.</p><p>Black has been banned from the Versus girl's wardrobe in favor of steely grays and peachy pinks, punctuated by stiff injections of neon pink, acid yellow and aqua green. Donatella boldly paired striped spaghetti pants with a black-and-white floral-print blazer. Graffiti-print jackets and halter dresses matched her artfully decorated runway. For extra impact, there was an orange-pink mod coat with patent detailing.</p><p>Those Versus enthusiasts for whom clubbing comes as naturally as breathing did not go home disappointed, thanks to scalloped minidresses laden with rhinestones, tiered miniskirts, flouncy tops and snazzy ankle-sock booties in assorted colors.</p></div>"
100,spring,2002,s2002,viktor-rolf,"How could Dutch duo Viktor &amp; Rolf possibly follow their triumphant, all-black fall exploration of volumes and silhouettes? How else but with an effervescent, all-white spring exploration of… volumes and silhouettes.</p><p>Huge silver organ pipes provided a stunning backdrop for prim Balenciaga-inspired 1940's boxy jackets with oversize buttons, lace dresses with built-in belts, and bow-covered suits. The tuxedo—a mandatory piece in every Viktor &amp; Rolf collection—came in white and silver brocade, with a tidal wave of ruffles crashing forth from within its lapels. A rope-piped pantsuit, several heart-printed trousers and plenty of sheer shirts looked like commercial hits, but the truly outstanding items were the immense, double-and-triple-waist pleated skirts and massively oversized shirts and jackets. These sculptural masterpieces could easily pass as extravagant bridal dresses—not to mention being mistaken for particularly sumptuous wedding cakes.</p><p>“The collection is about love and goodness and being positive—that's all we can really say about it,” said Rolf after the show. “For us, the medium is the message.”</p></div>"
101,spring,2002,s2002,wink,"Wynn Smith's Wink line has always evoked a very specific subsection of American youth—well-bred girls who, for one reason or another, have gone bad (or at least want to dress that way).</p><p>Next Spring, Smith's followers will stomp about in great-looking confetti-print crepe de chine dresses; instead of conventional suits, they will wear street-ready shrunken pinstripe blazers and long denim skirts with matching patchwork insets. Also likely to show up on hipper college campuses across the country are Smith's bias-tucked shirts, baggy linen jeans and khaki belted trenches. It's unlikely, on the other hand, that his shapeless, gauzy smocks or baggy bikini bottoms will find many takers.</p><p>Smith has consistently displayed an ability to push buttons with his confident aesthetic and irreverent sense of humor—an early collection played out as a homage to Patty Hearst, while another was titled ""No Free Love Hippie Shit Here."" Alas, this time around, the show's self-consciously grungy styling (sundress open to the navel, anyone?) and aggressive soundtrack proved more jarring than intriguing.</p></div>"
102,spring,2002,s2002,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto's cult status derives from his blending of contemporary Western tailoring with elements of traditional Japanese dress—a combination that was brilliantly explored in his collaboration with Adidas for Fall 2001.</p><p>For Spring, Yamamoto returned to some of last season's sports-inspired themes. Athletic bodysuits were worn under lightweight wrap skirts held up with thin shoulder straps; cropped, shiny zip-up blousons gave flowing gowns a streetwise appeal. Yamamoto deconstructed masculine suits by hacking off their sleeves and cinching jackets with decorative bands, or removing their back panels and replacing them with long braids of shredded fabric. Less severe were the floral-printed pantaloons, draped dresses and flowing skirts with pockets concealed in the waistband.</p><p>Yamamoto's partnership with Adidas is proving to be an extremely fruitful one. Sneaker collectors will not want to miss out on the fabulous three-stripe high-tops and scalloped-edge trainers.</p></div>"
1,fall,2002,f2002,a-f-vandevorst,"A.F. Vandevorst invited a thousand guests to a derelict cellar and jammed them together body-to-body on hard wooden benches. Then, after nearly an hour, they turned on strobes so violent people were screaming for mercy. Having successfully driven the audience to the brink of epileptic convulsion, the designers began their show. Ah, Paris! So edgy, it hurts.</p><p>Miraculously, even the application of this Belgian-style torture wasn't enough to ruin what turned out to be a good collection, once the lights were turned on. An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, a pleasant couple from Antwerp, have a distinctive way of juxtaposing formal clothes with athletic pieces and graphic knitwear. Sometimes they put things on back to front, like the excellently cut men's formal tailcoats, or silk dresses. Their yellow and black stripy and zigzag sweater dresses, tights and enormous scarves looked strong interspersed with nylon bombers and ski gilets. The eveningwear has a cool, all-black drama created by layering on sequins and fringe and finishing the look with leggings and slick over-the-knee boots.</p><p>After the show, An Vandevorst said she and her husband were inspired by honey bees. But, please, it's going too far to sting a supportive audience with all that pain.</p></div>"
2,fall,2002,f2002,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti has built her reputation on thinking pretty. Her favorite ways of expressing that are in fragile chiffon party dresses and sweetly-cut princess coats. For fall she does both, but with a hint of the Austro-Hungarian influence that has emerged as one of Milan's propositions for translating spring's folklore feeling into fall clothes.</p><p>The Austrian touches turn up in Ferretti's use of loden and brown and in details like the Tyrolean bindings on her signature coats, military frogging decorating the sleeve of a blazer or felt cutouts adorning a duffel. There are precisely-cut peacoats, pants with raised seams and Aran knits which give Ferretti's girl an ample daytime wardrobe. Come nighttime though, she's back to her fairy chiffons which this season are subjected to endless variations of asymmetric cutting with pleats, raw-edged garlands of petals, twisted shoulder straps, ribbon ties and inserts of three-dimensional flower decorations, mostly in black.</p></div>"
3,fall,2002,f2002,alessandro-dell-acqua,"""It's always images of Helmut Newton from the '70s that inspire me,"" says Alessandro Dell'Acqua. ""That sense of femininity, sensuality and strength.""</p><p>In Dell'Acqua's fall collection, that strand of design, abstracted from the tradition of Saint Laurent, turned rock'n'roll in a Milanese kind of way. His loopy black carpet-knit jackets recalled Saint Laurent's seminal 1940s collection, but were also cousins of this season&amp;'s knits at Balenciaga and Helmut Lang. Dell'Acqua's personal signatures, meanwhile—chiffon dresses and delicate underwear—showed through in handkerchief-point crinkled shifts, sheer ivory pieces scattered with silver sequins, and the lace-edged satin lingerie peeping out amongst the knits. He also merged classic tuxedo dressing with sport elements, transposing the satin ribbon of a ""smoking"" trouser onto cashmere sweat pants. The collection was at its hippest in its simpler moments, though, where Dell'Acqua applied his tailoring skills to neat shrunken jackets, A-line skirts and flares in navy blue cotton.</p></div>"
4,fall,2002,f2002,alexander-mcqueen,"Casting away all but one of his usual theatrical props, Alexander McQueen proved to Paris that his design can stand on its own dramatically erotic strengths. Showing in the shadowy medieval vaulted hall of the Conciergerie, McQueen couldn’t resist a lone, macabre trick—a vista of a pack of caged wolves, and the opening image of a lone figure clad in a purple leather cape leading a pair of dogs (who looked more scared than scary). But that was just for old times’ sake. When his models stalked out in brown tweed, tailored to within an inch of their lives, and strapped into variations on brown leather braces, it was clear McQueen was concentrating on clothes and not theatrics.</p><p>His vixenish women had tiny-waisted silhouettes done with amazing attention to cut and detail. Milkmaid necklines—far from innocent-were pushed up by leather bodices that curved down into the tightest pencil skirts, and finished off with thigh-high leather boots. McQueen moved from that Helmut Newton-esque fantasy to another—bad schoolgirls, who mixed lingerie and silver lamé ties and skirts in with their proper blazers and duffels. For a splendid finale, he brought out romantic flouncy skirts, an exaggerated puff sleeved black velvet coat and a skirt made of swags of jet beading. Best of all, he's softened his sometimes severe hand so that the idea of wearing these pieces seems not just possible, but quite appealing.</p><p>A trim McQueen took his bow in a bespoke suit made by the Savile Row tailors, Huntsman. It seemed like a coming of age. “I wanted it to be romantic, beautiful,” he said. “Power to the women! I got fit for this and I worked hard for it.”</p></div>"
5,fall,2002,f2002,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Brazilian-born Alexandre Herchcovitch followed up his strong Spring show with a walk on the conceptual side for Fall. The predominant silhouette was the voluminous skirt, puffed up with tulle petticoats and possibly inspired by Christian Dior's classic post-war ""New Look."" While Dior's aim was to create attenuated ""femme fleurs,"" Herchcovitch, in contrast, looks to deconstruct traditional conceptions of beauty. He speckled or covered his models' faces with varying degrees of black paint, hung photographs on chains around their necks and substituted sneakers for stilettos.</p><p>The step-riddled set was effective for showing the beauty of color and volume in motion (models flashed their fluorescent knee braces climbing up and down), but the self-conscious presentation often overwhelmed the viable sportswear separates slipped in among the more inflated looks. Most notable were the cargo pants, which the designer made his own with the successful addition of quilting and lingerie button detailing, and the well-tailored jackets and denim pieces that were the true stars of Herchcovitch's show-cum-installation.</p></div>"
6,fall,2002,f2002,alexandre-matthieu,"One day, you're just another pair of starving Paris designers with a miniscule business and no name recognition. The next day, Björk—the one-woman Medici of avant-garde fashion—wears your dress to the Cannes Film Festival and presto! Retailers are beating a path to your garret.</p><p>That's essentially what happened to Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, the design duo known as Alexandre Matthieu. And while they're not exactly taking business away from Ralph Lauren—this was only their fourth formal show—the duo is establishing an idiosyncratic, artsy look in the vein of Dries Van Noten and Jean Paul Gaultier.</p><p>Fluttery silks and chiffons, some printed with what looked like Icelandic runes, were anchored by tailored pants or long coats. Green leather pieces were inset with white leaves. Of course, there was black, including a great-looking sheer sweater constructed from diagonal bands, but Alexandre Matthieu also brought in a welcome draft of color, including russet, lemon and lavender. Those retailers should drop Björk a thank-you note.</p></div>"
7,fall,2002,f2002,alice-roi,"A search for security? A return to a safer time? A meeting at the Junior League? Alice Roi's Fall collection suggested all of these things and more.</p><p>Roi's inspiration was ""the days of the debutantes""—although she clearly wasn't thinking about gin-swilling Jazz Age nymphets; hers are a more sedate group who wear Ferragamo flats and buy investment clothes. Even when showing edgier ideas, Roi has always been a strong tailor, and this collection's simple lines showed off her skill. Palazzo pants hung perfectly off the models' hips, an ankle-length ivory velvet coat had just the right flare and a wool jersey dress skimmed the body without a hitch.</p><p>The clothes did occasionally get a little too serious. A straightforward red cashmere knit dress would need to be worn with a lot of attitude—or by someone under 25—to avoid coming off as starchy, and some of the velvet pieces sat rather heavily. Roi's wit shone through, though, in the fuzzy ivory fisherman's knits: a shrunken hoody cardigan with poet sleeves, a halter dress, a sleeveless top. And the glitzy red-and-gold brocade pants worn with a skintight ivory top and red cashmere tank? Just the thing to bring out the bad girl trapped inside every well-behaved deb.</p></div>"
8,fall,2002,f2002,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester has carved out a separate space in the international design landscape, and populated it with a tribe of her own cool people—men and women who look like proud survivors of the apocalypse. It's a dark vision, but goth is too crude a label to slap on Demeulemeester. Her supple, patinated leathers and drapey layers of luxurious fabrics bound with multiple thick belts have a subtle elegance that transcends lumpen adolescent angst.</p><p>Like other designers this season, Demeulemeester thought about combat pants, but hers were done in velvet or soft fabric shot with Lurex and tucked into tough, high leather boots wrapped with thongs. Her vests, jackets and floorsweeping coats sprouted savage edges of long-haired shearling on the shoulder or about the neck, like hunting trophies.</p><p>If the impression Demeuelemeester's design gives is of a group of cave-dwellers, they're a sophisticated bunch with a taste for the trappings of civilization. At night, they wear delicate ivory sequin-scattered dresses, or make an entrance to a clan gathering in a sheer dress with a hood pulled mysteriously over the face. These may be troubled times, Demeulemeester seems to be saying, but that's no excuse to skimp on style.</p></div>"
9,fall,2002,f2002,anna-sui,"Well before fashion's current love of groupie chic and punk revival took hold, rock 'n' roll was Anna Sui's chief source of inspiration. Each Sui collection reveals what's been in her CD player, and for Fall she clearly had Cream, T. Rex and Sergeant Pepper–era Beatles in heavy rotation. The result was a groovy, hippie show that wouldn't have been out of place at Woodstock—although it looked just fine on Naomi Campbell, Carolyn Murphy and all the other top models who regularly walk Sui's show.</p><p>On the bill were chiffon baby-doll tops with vivid Indian prints, appliquéd denim skirts, studded boot-cut cords, open-work crocheted tops and dresses, and wool separates embroidered with folky cross-stitch. Sui worked mostly in dark hues, with occasional forays into historically appropriate colors like purple, olive green and peacock blue. Greatest hits included a series of pretty, sheer floral-print dresses and two great embroidered Mongolian lamb-trimmed coats that screamed ""light my fire.""</p><p>Worn head-to-toe, this collection could be too trippy-hippie for the average customer. But a few pieces from Sui's '60s anthology could retune any wardrobe.</p></div>"
10,fall,2002,f2002,anne-klein,"Anne Klein, who died in 1974, was a forceful proponent of smart, fashionable, well-made clothes for working women (a philosophy she passed on to her former design assistant Donna Karan). But the past few years have seen several changes in direction for the company she founded, which has lost ground as a result.</p><p>Now, with new ownership and a new design director, Charles Nolan, the house is hoping to reclaim its rightful place in executive wardrobes. Nolan came to Anne Klein from Ellen Tracy, another bastion of career clothes, so he knows what works in a boardroom and what doesn't. No micro-minis, no sheer tops; instead, he offered a solid series of items like A-line leather skirts, short shearling jackets, crisply creased trousers and tweed three-quarter coats. Styles were fitted, but never supertight, and the color palette stuck close to tones of mocha, cream, white, black and navy.</p><p>Busy women like to look good, of course, but Nolan knows they also like to save time; to cut down on agonizing decision-making, he showed all his looks, even a slinky white jersey evening dress with black stiletto snakeskin boots.</p></div>"
11,fall,2002,f2002,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi is a young designer with a British-Italian background and Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design credentials. After briefly showing as a recent graduate in the late Nineties, he vanished from the London fashion scene only to reappear in Milan. No wonder the Italians embraced his hybrid sensibility: he loves girls in eveningwear dressed to the max and never holds back.</p><p>Berardi's southern Italian roots show in his affinity for decoration, and his London upbringing in his taste for tougher, punk-influenced styling. For Fall 2002, he used patterned leather made to look like fabric, in swing-skirted dresses with corseted torsos emphasized with multiple studded belts. Berardi revved up white tailoring and black jersey with bondage straps bristling with silver hardware, and wasn't afraid to send out a pant suit in bubble-gum pink lace and leather. With his asymmetric chiffon dresses and loudly patterned lace-and-bead-encrusted boots, the designer's bravado performance was very much in the vein of John Galliano's work at Dior. For next season, he has signed a deal with Gibo which offers him the chance to develop a more personal signature.</p></div>"
12,fall,2002,f2002,as-four,"No New York fashion week is complete without at least one event that features some combination of the following: a much-hyped young talent; a mob scene at the door, complete with screaming security guards; a chaotic presentation; and, oh yes, some legitimate talent. This season, that event came courtesy of As Four, the avant-garde design collective that made its name with the ubiquitous, influential circle handbag a few seasons ago.</p><p>Scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Cooper Union theater, the show didn’t actually get underway until close to 10:30. That left ample time for the crowd to sneak cigarettes and drink the copious amounts of wine that had been supplied by the group’s sponsor, Italian company Ecco Domani.</p><p>And the collection itself? Well, there were some pretty clothes hidden underneath the perversely cut lamé outfits and string-sculpture tops, and the soft flower hats worn by some of the models were gorgeous. But however talented they are as designers, the group proved equally adept at using pretentious staging, difficult lighting and an off-putting soundtrack to obscure the fruits of their labors. If only the fashion could have flowed as freely as the wine.</p></div>"
13,fall,2002,f2002,badgley-mischka,"Into each life a little eveningwear must fall. The problem is that too often, formal dress fits into one of three categories: boring black, prom-queen redux or dowager-dowdy. Design duo Badgley Mischka are none of the above. They've built a nice business—and a hefty celebrity following—making elegant formal clothes that satisfy the demands of the Park Avenue charity circuit as well as Hollywood's red-carpet gauntlet.</p><p>For Fall, Badgley Mischka did it again. In another of the small showroom shows so popular this season, they presented 44 options for evening, from simple (a black georgette dress ornamented with ribbons and black beads) to super-siren (a scarlet gown with a lace-lined plunging neckline). In a niche used to a piling on of glitz, they mostly showed admirable restraint, relying on body-hugging cuts, sheer fabrics and a few well-placed ruffles to communicate sex appeal. Hip girls will like the ivory and black-lace tiered cocktail dress; hip moms will dig a snappy little ivory ribbon cocktail suit. Halle Berry will snag the ivory velvet gown with red beading.</p></div>"
14,fall,2002,f2002,balenciaga,"The 26 looks that Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquière showed here today at the Gagosian Gallery will be more scrutinized than Enron’s balance sheet. That’s because Ghesquière has become one of fashion’s magnate designers, able to change the look of a season with one outfit. Moving his fall show to New York from Paris added a significant jolt to fashion week, increased by the fact that getting one of the 200 tickets was well-nigh impossible.</p><p>But well worth the effort. In front of an audience that included both fashion maven Sarah Jessica Parker and Domenico de Sole, president and CEO of Balenciaga parent Gucci Group, Ghesquière breezed confidently through a collection that was inventive, original—and commercially viable. The all-black opening was tough-girl chic: variations on the motorcycle jacket, with exaggerated knit collars and worn with skintight pants or tight, flippy skirts. He showed soft, oversized sweaters and jackets, and a small group of colorful knee-length collage dresses apparently influenced by Cubist paintings. Ghesquière helped usher in fashion’s current love of artisan craft, and the dramatic, shaggy ivory coats that closed the show could double as soft sculpture.</p><p>While some designers struggle to express one theme per season, Ghesquière’s dilemma seems to be how to control his bountiful creative flow.</p></div>"
15,fall,2002,f2002,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria, the founder and designer of BCBG, is a man who generally keeps a finger firmly on the fashion pulse. The company has been turning out smart takes on sophisticated trends for more than a decade, making loyal customers out of women who love fashion but whose budgets don't stretch to big-ticket designers.</p><p>For his Fall collection, Azria seemed to be tuned more to a jungle beat than a style channel. With a few exceptions, every look consisted of layered, crinkled gauze or chiffon dresses, done in tones of brown, black or olive and weighted down with chains or studded leather belts. Asymmetrical hems and necklines were the order of the day, and there was enough shredding on the runway to pique the interest of the SEC.</p><p>Highlights included a black wool three-quarter coat with fur trim, some well-cut pinstripe jackets and trousers, and a suede studded skirt. And knowing how much women love options, Azria created a great boot: With parallel zippers at two heights, it goes from ankle- to knee-high in an instant.</p></div>"
16,fall,2002,f2002,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour's Fall show—her first on a runway—could literally be described as poetic. Having immersed herself in Byron, Herman Melville, A. E. Housman and Emily Dickinson for inspiration, the designer embroidered lines from each of these poets in gold thread on several of her pieces.</p><p>Sarafpour used fabrics that ranged from rich velvets to crisp cotton canvas to light-as-air georgette, and divided her show into daytime and evening looks. Unlike many designers who think their customers undergo a personality change when the sun goes down, Sarafpour's woman starts and ends her day with a sense of easy romance. The varied palette included black, navy, white, pink, plum, gray and lilac, and the silhouette was long but not skintight; Sarafpour's georgette evening dresses skimmed the body like slips. Strong tailoring was also in evidence, exemplified by a snappy blue alpaca trench worn over a black georgette blouse and low-slung velvet pants. Sweet bits of girlishness were added to several looks with streaming ribbons, subtle metal fringe or the odd floral patchwork pocket.</p><p>In short, this beautifully edited show (14 looks in all) was brief as a haiku and light as an Elizabethan sonnet.</p></div>"
17,fall,2002,f2002,benjamin-cho,"Benjamin Cho knows how to edit: His short, quiet show, held in the Japan Society’s auditorium, contained a mere 16 looks. The collection was sponsored by Shiseido, which has been backing promising new designers as a way to get their message into the mainstream.</p><p>Cho is possessed of both technical skills and a sense of humor—a happy combination. His first look was a lightweight black knife-pleated jacket worn over skinny black pants whose white lacings started at a pair of Converse high-tops and ran all the way up the leg. This was followed by a lovely black jacket with a graceful cascading ruffle at the waist. The designer’s side-lacing pieces had some S&amp;M charm, and there were clever dresses with circular inserts of gathered contrasting fabric, as well as pretty ruched tops. But ruching and lacing aren’t exactly new ideas, and—even with severe editing—the looks got repetitive.</p></div>"
18,fall,2002,f2002,bernhard-willhelm,"As a recording of the day's news from a German TV station played in the background, Bernhard Willhelm's show gave viewers a strange sensation something akin to watching a child psychology session in progress. Willhelm's subjects have reached the brink of adolescence, don't know whether to retreat into the safety of childhood or confront the scary outside world, and look like they might have made their clothes in an art-therapy group.</p><p>The healing began with girls walking out in dresses and skirts made from what looked like dinosaur-appliqued nursery curtains or bedspreads, their faces daubed with face-paint. For the next stage of treatment, the kids had been encouraged to do all sorts of things with sweatshirts and shell suits—like embroidering them with AC/DC slogans, trees, angels and dog-skeletons, and somehow throwing in their mothers' Hermès scarf print symbols. (They had also decided to sport their pencils, paintbrushes and rulers around their necks as jewelry.) At mealtime, they were out to lunch in a Ronald McDonald-meets-the-Simpsons clownish world of brash polka dots and harlequin patterns.</p><p>It's easy to laugh, but Bernhard Willhelm touches a nerve. He's a designer acutely sensitized to the weirdness and stress of being young in the contemporary world and many fashion followers of his generation understand exactly what he's saying.</p></div>"
19,fall,2002,f2002,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson has the three things that most designers struggle for their entire lives: a signature look, a solid business and a legion of devoted customers. All of which allows her to kick back at her fashion shows and concentrate on entertaining the troops—and herself. This season, the show was in her workroom, the theme was ""Sisters"" and the cutting table was her runway.</p><p>Johnson had 22 of her staff members model the collection; you'll be shocked to discover that she hires a lot of extroverts. Everyone from Jill in PR to Marcy the receptionist to Rebecca the patternmaker worked the runway like pros, shimmying to a bluesy soundtrack and eliciting big smiles from the audience—not to mention wolf whistles from the photographers. The clothes helped. There were clingy bias-cut satin ombré dresses, shirred chiffons, flapper-fringe skirts, sheer crocheted tops and an occasional pair of army-green knickers. The palette was relatively subdued; this season, Johnson's big on blues, pinks, peaches, brown and bronze, and fabrics like chiffon, charmeuse and matte jersey.</p><p>Johnson's clothes are overtly sexy, with plenty of boudoir influences—eyelet, lingerie ribbons, cleavage-enhancing lace and so forth—but always with a good-time Mae West spirit. Her sister act, while not for everyone, can be hard to resist.</p></div>"
20,fall,2002,f2002,bill-blass,"With two well-received collections behind him, Bill Blass designer Lars Nilsson is still being scrutinized by the arbiters of style. After all, the fashion industry is full of one-season wonders. And Mr. Blass, although retired, is still very much a name that matters to his devoted clients (who eagerly await his biography, due out next month).</p><p>Part of the liveliness that Nilsson has injected into the Blass label comes from his delight in color and pattern. For Fall, he was inspired in large part by the traditional textiles and handcrafts of the Amish and his native Sweden, which he worked into the Blass tradition of well-tailored sportswear. Nilsson took a leaf pattern and turned it into a colorful, oversize print for silk satin, and showed a sweeping, fur-trimmed white coat with a ladder of black stripes. There were shapely wool suits, a luxuriously cozy embroidered cashmere anorak and, for evening, a series of lovely dresses, including a rainbow-hued, hand-tinted velvet number.</p><p>Though Nilsson leaned a little too heavily on his traditional sources this time around, he continues to bring a new spirit—and a new sense of buzz—to the hallowed house of Blass.</p></div>"
21,fall,2002,f2002,blaak,"The search for escape routes out of the ""peasant"" and ""tribal"" themes of Spring—without abandoning the color and energy they brought to the scene—is becoming part of the saga of this season's collections. When Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif of Blaak took their own particular streetwise diversion off the nomad path, they ended up with a hit.</p><p>Adding a tougher edge to hippie eclecticism, Blaak put zippy bomber jackets in overdyed furnishing fabric over layered lace-edged skirts, and used shots of bright orange, turquoise and purple against military greens. And while Mexican references could be seen in a great stripy shoulder bag and the knitted shawls wound around some outfits, the real success of the collection was that it didn't look like a bunch of travelers' souvenirs. That's thanks to the rumpled treatment of washed and worn-in cotton drill and silk, the offhand sexiness of the drapey jersey tanks knotted at the shoulders, and the fact that the models swaggered in their hip-slung skirts and pants in elongated Robert Clergerie flats. No '60s hippie ever dressed like that, nor had that attitude—which is exactly what made this collection look so fresh.</p></div>"
22,fall,2002,f2002,hugo-boss,"Since its days costuming those suave, slick guys on <em>Miami Vice</em>, Hugo Boss has specialized in making traditional corporate wear look sexy. The company has gone through several evolutions since then, including adding women's wear to its repertoire, but its Fall collection showed it can still dress the new power generation.</p><p>Using body-hugging lines and stretch fabrics that look by turns crisp and fluid, Boss managed to give traditional silhouettes an appealing twist. After starting out with an all-white group (head-to-toe monochrome dressing has emerged as a major trend this season) Boss added all-black and then tones of plum, brown and smoky gray. Jackets were cut close to the body and stopped at the hip or at the top of the leg, and worn over slim or even skintight pants. Bias-cut skirts were paired with gauzy knits or turtlenecks, while lightweight, long-sleeve dresses got a touch of femininity with pin-tucking and scooping necklines.</p><p>While the fashion ideas presented weren't exactly new kids on the block, the Boss collection reflects its ultimate customer: confident and irreproachably pulled together.</p></div>"
23,fall,2002,f2002,boudicca,"The Boudicca experience is an intense one. For designers Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby, fashion goes far beyond the simple enjoyment of things to wear, and into the realms of symbolism, psychology and politics.</p><p>This show was a walk on the dark side—literally. Models walked in somber steps, following a spotlight that was dragged overhead to illuminate their way in a blacked-out studio. But if the sinister portent hanging over this collection was unavoidable, it never overshadowed the level of refinement Boudicca's work has reached. Unlike many less experienced London designers, Broach and Kirkby have a rigorous way of cutting and tailoring that produces precisely pressed and folded graphic shapes that could not have come from any other hands. A Boudicca piece—whether an asymmetric satin skirt, a kimono dress with a caped top or a dinner jacket with the lapels fused into the jacket and the tail lopped off square—is recognizable by its formality, dignity and presence.</p><p>Though these compelling qualities have spellbound many fashion insiders, outside support has been hard to come by—maybe because the label is impossible to pigeonhole by trend or category. Barneys New York is one of the few stores to carry Boudicca pieces, as was the London boutique Yasmin Cho, which has recently gone out of business. Such blows are capable of knocking small designers off-course, but by the look of this collection, Boudicca is determined to keep on following its own uncompromising path.</p></div>"
24,fall,2002,f2002,bruce,"Bruce sailed into Fall with a nautical-themed show that deftly displayed the draping and construction talents of designers Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli. This Shiseido-sponsored collection, the team's tenth, featured 15 looks that each emphasized what Gutierrez described as ""the freedom and lightness of the fabric.""</p><p>Bruce's theme was evoked with details like cording, ""sail"" belts and knot-like draping. Sex appeal was in ample supply thanks to pieces like the fine net top worn, with a black tank dress, by Caroline Ribeiro. Highlights included the black pocket pants modeled by Delfine—a trimmer, refined take on slouchy hip-hop trousers. The pairing of floaty draped pieces with more substantial, almost sporty separates such as tab jeans and a car coat kept things on an even keel, with only the voluminous, multi-cowl blouses ever threatening the balance. Jody Busby's single earrings—dangling chunks of stone wrapped with thread-thin wire—added some sparkle to the somberly colored clothes, which were all rendered in a muted palette of black, smoke, taupe and teal.</p><p>This was a collection for confident sophisticates, exuding an ease and fluidity that have been finely honed over the last few seasons.</p></div>"
25,fall,2002,f2002,burberry-prorsum,"Burberry's chief designer is Christopher Bailey, a 30-year-old Brit with an international pedigree that includes a long stint under Tom Ford at Gucci and before that a stop at Donna Karan. That experience has primed him as a brand-conscious team leader, who has already focused the disparate aspects of the Burberry London collection, rethought the house plaid and bumped up the accessories.</p><p>It's a different challenge, though, to forge a vision for the Burberry Prorsum label—the ""designer"" collection of a house whose reputation was built on a classic raincoat. For his first official show, Bailey took a younger approach than his predecessor, Roberto Menichetti, showing double-breasted coats in modernized slubby tweeds and using a paisley motif that was printed on wool shirts and embroidered or embossed as a pattern on coats and jackets. Bailey also transposed the anatomy of a Burberry mac—the belts, buckles, hooks, epaulettes and storm flaps—into punky straps and hardware on low-slung skirts, culottes and pants. Though it wasn't enough to trigger a second wave of Burberry fever, the designer did devise a treat for accessory lovers; his huge leather and tweed bags hanging from thick straps looked great.</p></div>"
26,fall,2002,f2002,cacharel,"Cacharel is the perky mademoiselle of French fashion, with roots in the Seventies ready-to-wear revolution that made snappy style affordable and available for the fillies in the street. Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro, enthusiastic believers in upholding Cacharel's value-for-money tradition, are happy to play with the pretty prints and neat separates that made the house's reputation.</p><p>For fall, they called on Celia Birtwell, the printmaker who worked with (and was married to) designer Ossie Clark in the Seventies, to create some designs for Cacharel. And from her front-row seat at the show, Birtwell watched her handiwork go by: hand-drawn leaves, flowers and cameo doodles ornamented high-waisted Ossie-like fluted dresses, silky skirts, trenches and blouses. Those were interspersed with jeans, glazed cotton bombers and little sixties-style velvet double-breasted suits trimmed with denim. Afterward, Birtwell said she thought the prints ""looked rather good."" Clements, for her part, said working in an Ossie Clark aesthetic was a dream come true. ""When I was seven, I saw Ossie in Camden market and asked him for a job,"" she said. ""He was wearing a yellow cape covered in bells and carrying a King Charles spaniel. If I'd been old enough, I'd have been a total Ossie girl.""</p></div>"
27,fall,2002,f2002,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein is one of the great zeitgeist readers of our time. His collections, like his famous ad campaigns, always reflect and amplify some aspect of the national mood, but filtered through his cool, minimalist aesthetic. And in his beautiful Fall show, Klein mirrored a sober but still sensuous attitude toward life during wartime.</p><p>Klein's first group was, like many this week, all black, starting with a fitted coat whose seams were traced in leather and followed by sweeping dresses, pleated skirts and tops done in flowing fabrics. He then introduced tones of brown, gray and navy, and worked in military references, like a taupe Eisenhower jacket and a few officer's greatcoats recut with the new, higher waistline. But while Klein's smart menswear tailoring touches were present throughout—pants cut slim but not skintight, jackets that sat just above the waist—the net effect was always feminine, helped by sexily transparent knits, floaty georgette tops and a fit that lightly grazed the body.</p><p>Klein's eveningwear is always noteworthy for its inventive cut and restrained romance, and he didn't disappoint this season. He sent out a gorgeous series of dresses assembled from diamond-shaped pieces of satin that will make even the most determined nesters long for a black-tie evening.</p></div>"
28,fall,2002,f2002,carolina-herrera,"For Fall 2002, Carolina Herrera did what jazz musicians do all the time: Take a standard and breathe new life into it. In her own riff on a series of classics, Herrera turned out a luxurious, perfectly balanced show that could easily have been titled ""Lush Life.""</p><p>Herrera's concise collection, shown to a small audience in her showroom, was built around menswear fabrics and tailoring, reworked to very feminine proportions and in a restrained palette of black, ivory, gold and gray. Crisply tailored, wide-leg pants showed up either as part of a suit—the jackets with a hint of built-up shoulder, the button-front vests worn as a top—or with sexy, silky shirts. There were glimpses of well-bred glitz throughout. A restrained gold-lamé fabric, for instance, was made day-wearable in a narrow coat or the aforementioned trousers, while some of the jackets got a whirl of gold beading on the shoulders. Plush leopard-stenciled lamb showed up in a simple belted coat, and as a jacket over a satin skirt.</p><p>For evening, Herrera sent out a series of slinky black dresses, each set off by one eye-catching detail: a flash of red lining, a cascade of ruffles or a deep plunge neckline.</p></div>"
29,fall,2002,f2002,catherine-malandrino,"After presenting her Spring collection at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, Malandrino migrated downtown to a raw space in the meat-packing district next to the infamous Hogs &amp; Heifers bar—an appropriate location for her Western-themed Fall collection, titled ""Wanted.""</p><p>The show certainly did not want for theatricality. The models made their exits with deeply smudged eyes and masses of tumbleweed hair in a variety of blouses that were shirred, tucked, embroidered, smocked and otherwise embellished. These were paired with equally elaborate trousers, the most notable of which was the signature Wanted pant: low-waisted, ruched, laced and so wide-bottomed at the foot that they swept the floor. The leather appliqué pants were strong, as were some of the coats.</p><p>Some of the looks presented (including the aforementioned pants) were from Malandrino's new limited-edition series, which she hopes customers will collect as if they were works of art. At times, though, the show was in need of less art and more reality. As much as the designer sought ""the feeling of getting lost in a wild plain,"" there were moments when it seemed as if she had ended up on the set of <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</em> instead.</p></div>"
30,fall,2002,f2002,celine,"Michael Kors opened his Celine show with Caroline Ribeiro walking out in a long camel coat, black silk shirt with a matching fringed silk scarf, and a pair of what he calls ""flight pants."" It signaled the mood of a collection that was about well-cut, understandable sportswear with an international spin aimed at women with a taste for modern classics.</p><p>The warm, rugged WWII flying jacket has functioned as an iconic taking-off point for many designers this season. Kors refined it into a beautiful sandblasted shearling patchwork coat and a series of variations on the bomber jacket, and extrapolated the antique leather look into skirts and almost luggage-sized hand-held totes. He also transposed elements of the classic pilot's jumpsuit—zippered pockets, military cottons—into casual pants and skirts in a soft gray waxed nylon and later into citified broadcloth.</p><p>But this was no history-of-aviation theme show. Instead, Kors concentrated on workable wardrobe options like luxe wool denim jeans with a tapering flare, turtlenecks, belted leather jackets and slim ankle-length cardigan coats in cashmere knit. But while fur shrugs and a huge wine-colored fox worn by Carmen Kass added a special touch, something was missing from this well-behaved presentation. Michael Kors is one of the wittiest characters in the fashion universe, and Paris mourns the sense of humor he's applied in happier seasons.</p></div>"
31,fall,2002,f2002,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan likes to set an intelligence test for his audience. When a lone Asian model walked on stage dressed in what was clearly a genuine ethnic costume, then stood stock-still for fifteen long minutes, there was restlessness and discomfort in the crowd. Was this some sort of silent protest? Was that a tear trickling down the poor girl’s face?</p><p>When she was joined by several other models whose costumes were increasingly overlaid by black shards of western menswear fabric, the guessing game entered a new round. First, Chalayan segued into black skirt and pantsuits done with his distinctive asymmetric cuts. The free-floating strips of fabric he’s been attaching to clothes since last season recurred, both through the tailoring and hitched to jersey dresses, which were constructed to drape, bunch up and fall in waves at the hemline. Then he turned to cotton sweat-fabric, cut raw-edged as tops over little flouncy skirts and as a plunge-front gray halter dress with a full, swingy hemline—simple but elegantly modern. Moving into brown canvas, he cut short dresses and coats with military pockets and then layered a net web over black jersey dresses.</p><p>After the show, Chalayan revealed that the ethnic costume came from a region of eastern Turkey, but refused any further explanation, saying, “Interpret it as you will.” No matter: neither enigmatic pronouncements nor symbolic gestures could obscure the fact that these were stunning—and quite original—clothes.</p></div>"
32,fall,2002,f2002,chloe,"In her second season as Chloé design head, Phoebe Philo hit a lanky, confident stride. For Fall 2002, she gave sexy vitality to leg-lengthening pants, curvy jackets, chiffon tops and refined Sergeant Pepper style military coats, while never laying the retro/vintage theme on too thick.</p><p>Philo did velvet flares, gray-washed jeans with military buttonhole details, and an easy, slouchy man’s pant. She even cut schoolboy shorts in a low-slung way that avoided any association with cutesy hot pants. And, in the teeth of competition from pretty much every designer around, she turned out the best biker pants in town. Done in worn-looking gray-brown leather and cropped just below the knee, they were shown with the spindliest stiletto-heeled pumps—the killer kicker. For the top half, Philo turned her attention to jackets and coats with something special about them, and brought new energy to Chloé’s long-held reputation for chiffon pieces. Her black military tailcoats and jackets with flowered appliqués and Indian embroideries channeled a boho-60's eclecticism without looking like dusty fleamarket finds. For evening, she added sparkle by running silver bugle beads in strips or streamers from the shoulders of layered chiffon tops and tunics in patterns inspired by Leon Bakst.</p><p>In short: top marks to Philo for staying true to her young Brit-girl instincts, while respecting—and living up to—Parisian standards of design.</p></div>"
33,fall,2002,f2002,christian-dior,"Given John Galliano's track record of whizzing an overload of a trillion colors and cultural references past his bedazzled Dior audience, it hardly seems possible to say he's settling down. But this fall collection is almost classic in its Dior-isms containing all the patterns, symbols and accessories on which Galliano has re-built the house foundations. That means ethnic color and print, love of the eighteenth century, an obsession with bias-cut dresses, a ""sauvage"" method of cutting all his own—and, of course, the constantly updated Dior saddlebags.</p><p>Galliano's girls stormed out in Peruvian knitted hats sprouting huge Mohawks, their feet bound up in fur moccasin-boots. The clothes were sexily recut from a haul of Indian, South American, Mongolian and Tibetan materials. Flouncy skirts edged in gold Indian print sometimes with bells around the hem, Indian mirrored and gold embroidery, Hungarian rose folk prints, lacquered leather paisley and Chinese quilting—they were all there in a breathless melee. Standouts were the ruffled skirts with their gilded edges, and a patchwork inside-out fur with huge shoulders, painted to run from rose red through orange on the outside.</p><p>This season's saddlebag update—fresh accessories being a crucial part of every designer business—is oversized and done in patchwork suede and fur. As a nod to Christian Dior heritage, Galliano threw in some 1940s coats worn with round-toed pumps and woolly knee socks. But we hardly need the ""roots"" reminders these days. Galliano has so thoroughly remade the house in his own image, who cares?</p></div>"
34,fall,2002,f2002,christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix can usually be trusted to whip up a kaleidoscopic color-storm for his ready-to-wear collections, but for fall he held back and delivered a muted collection full of black, bordeaux and bois de rose pink.</p><p>Judging from the German cabaret music on the soundtrack, the designer's focus seems to have shifted from the sunny south to the faded decadence of northern Europe. Always a romantic though, Lacroix cut a recurring silhouette with a full skirt and a tiny jacket—whether a bolero or biker style—on top. He showed his taste for complex textures, embellishment and print in a slew of lace, devore velvet, ruching and patchwork, all done with an antiqued, slightly distressed look.</p><p>The best moments of the collection were the delicate pinks, the pretty sparkling tulle fairy dresses and the canvas arts-and-crafts painting and embroidery on the outside of a fur-lined coat and jacket.</p></div>"
35,fall,2002,f2002,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro's hand-crafty, sweetly eccentric collections have been one of the highlights of the London shows since the mid-90's. But the stakes have now been raised for the young duo, who are showing their own collection in Paris, as well as having taken the creative reins at Cacharel. Like all independent designers they face, not just the pressure to stun people with their originality, but the toughest financial climate in years to boot.</p><p>It was a shame, then, to see this show fall several notches short of the creativity benchmark set by Paris thus far. Clements Ribeiro said they'd been inspired by <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, which meant they'd followed the folkloric path already trodden by hordes of designers this season. They did picture-book flower appliqués sewn on to sweats, track tops, coats and skirts with blanket stitching. They got into pleating in a big way, in print skirts and plisse tops, and worked a new form of appliqué by cutting out raw-edged satin flowers and hand-sewing them to georgette. A small flash of their pioneering talent showed itself in cashmere knits with a version of their signature stripes done in bands of folky pattern. Shoes and boots featuring cut-out leaves of metallic leather were eyecatchingly sexy. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to suppress the feeling that Paris expects more of them than this.</p></div>"
36,fall,2002,f2002,comme-des-garcons,"You wouldn't normally associate Comme des Garçons with chic chignons—let alone the sound of Sinatra crooning ""let's face the music and dance."" But those were the classic elements in the background of a show that designer Rei Kawakubo described as ""free knitting."" Almost completely black, save for a couple of things in gray and a tint of blue, the collection was partly about Kawakubo revisiting her own past. Mostly, though, it was an intense research project into what can be done with different varieties of wool, knitting needles and an unconventional vision.</p><p>Kawakubo began by wrapping twisted cardigan-coats around the body so that pockets were displaced at odd angles and tan-yellow buttons spiraled the torso. The color blackout, and the consistent styling device of leggings-with-everything, gave Kawakubo artistic license to go crazy, experimenting with a vast range of shapes and stitches. Knit sweatshirting, bouclé and the season's loopy textured sweaters all turned up in a beautifully elegant, off-kilter way.</p><p>It was a long show. A lull could be felt, giving the audience time to ponder the poignant significance of Old Blue Eyes' lyrics (""there may be teardrops ahead""), but it was followed by a flurry of scribbling when a twisted, tufty raven's wing-colored fake fur coat and a leather-fronted double-breasted cardigan swung by. Life may be hard—but who cares when the fashion adrenaline's running high?</p></div>"
37,fall,2002,f2002,costume-national,"Like many designers, Ennio Capasa of Costume National went dark for Fall showing a collection that was mostly black, lit here and there by some winter white ensembles and touches of gold. As somber as the palette was, these were clothes not for goths, but for well-bred girls who like to think of themselves as ""bad."" Costume's hooded coat, leather bombers and cigarette-slim pants conjured nothing so much as a twenty-first century Sandra Dee.</p><p>Capasa was on-trend with his furiously furry jackets (a major theme of this season), but generally offered individual pieces rather than a fully focused collection. Which is not to say that some of those pieces weren't highly desirable. The smoking pantsuits and the short-as-they come mini dresses cinched with masculine-style leather belts (perfect for cocktails at eight) were strong, and provided an alternative—perhaps an antidote?—to some of the tougher leather looks, which seemed more suitable for an evening of chain-smoking and high-decibel rock.</p></div>"
38,fall,2002,f2002,d-g,"Hello, cowgirl in the sand. Or, in this case, the Alps. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana went north for inspiration for their Fall D&amp;G secondary line and came back with a Tyrolean-themed collection—just the thing for a sexy, young Heidi with a great figure and a good sense of humor.</p><p>Shown against a backdrop that included two plastic cows, a milking stool and a bucket, D&amp;G sent out gossamer peasant blouses, embroidered or eyelet-trimmed and paired with super-low-rise tight jeans, loose cargo pants or pleated micro-minis. Sheer chiffon dresses and blouses were worn over brightly-colored bras—not strictly Alpine, but certainly fun. Those mountain breezes can get chilly, though, so there were plenty of close-fitting Tyrolean jackets and vests, a granny-square stole, and generously cut sweater coats and scarves to keep warm. Should Heidi head into the big city for a date, she could choose a figure-hugging cowl-neck sweater dress or a plaid bustier with wool pants. And given the high proportion of men's looks that came down the runway, D&amp;G clearly has a mate in mind for their modern cowgirl.</p></div>"
39,fall,2002,f2002,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg's show has become the unofficial opening ceremony of fashion week, where socialites and industry types gather at the designer's headquarters for a high-powered Sunday-night happening. The front row this year included Susan Sarandon chatting with Ellen Barkin and tycoon husband Ron Perelman, Marisa Berenson, Cheryl Tiegs, and Jessica Alba with fiancé Michael Weatherly. Across the room, the Hilton sisters sat next to two of the Miller sisters, in a dazzling display of blonde socialite bonding.</p><p>There was plenty of commotion on the runway as well, as von Furstenberg once again pushed her identity past its wrap-dress roots. DVF's theme was ""Crosstown Traffic,"" an homage to the energy and variety of city living. For uptown girls, there were still those pretty chiffon dresses, but roughed up with graffiti or splatter prints and torn edges. Downtown types, meanwhile, might prefer the wide-leg embroidered pants paired with a gold velour T-shirt or a satin baseball jacket.</p><p>As she travels in a new direction, von Furstenberg is bound to hit some roadblocks, like this season's odd knee-length harem pants or the Obi-sleeve black-and-green closing number. But von Furstenberg has been making smart, sexy clothes for too long to let the occasional pothole slow her down.</p></div>"
40,fall,2002,f2002,dkny,"Donna Karan's secondary DKNY line is where the designer takes a walk on the wilder side. She romps through pop culture, digesting current trends and reworking them into a collection of snappy items. In a blindingly fast-paced show that mixed the women's and men's collections, the designer showed she still has the touch.</p><p>Karan is nothing if not eclectic, and here she managed to mix some seemingly irreconcilable themes. But then, who else could reconcile the urban gypsy (ruched, ruffled or patchwork leather skirts, lace-trimmed tops) with the new prepster (a monogram sweater, a fisherman knit hoody, pinstripe pants)? The subdued palette helped: There were shots of color, but Karan mostly restricted herself to brown, gray, white, navy and ivory. Also helping keep things grounded were staples of the straightforward sportswear that was DKNY's original base: snug pinstripe pants, a great pea coat, even some of the tailored jackets that Karan, a working woman herself, always includes.</p></div>"
41,fall,2002,f2002,dolce-gabbana,"For Fall 2002, Dolce &amp; Gabbana conducted a tour through their fashion heartland, pointing out everything they do best and romancing an idea Stefano Gabbana calls ""rustic glamor.""</p><p>For country lovers of the high-heeled-wearing kind, the design duo suggested sexy cords, beautiful handcrafted suede coats, Peruvian ponchos, chunky fur scarves and any number of fabulous outsize shoulder bags made of fringed wool and woven leather. Dolce &amp; Gabbana's signature masculine-feminine three-piece pantsuits looked classic yet freshly relevant, with their sharp tailoring and flattering vests (an item that's shooting up the Fall fashion charts). They also showed hip-slung bootleg or low-rider baggy cords, lingerie tops and a zillion desirable accessories—rope belts, long fringed scarves, stacks of gold bangles and bracelets and delicious boots and shoes—all corralled from a huge range of countrified textures and fabrics in shades of brown and cream.</p><p>Of course, no peasant maid would ever wear a thigh-high flirty skirt with a streetwise brown corduroy jacket bristling with buckled poacher-pockets. Or pick her way through fields in pale suede boots patterned in nail-head studs. But that's the genius of this label—total devotion to the cause of gorgeousness whatever terrain fashion happens to be passing through at the time.</p></div>"
42,fall,2002,f2002,donna-karan,"Donna Karan's new corporate culture may be French—her company is now part of the French luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH—but her heart belongs to NYC. And her Fall collection, shown to a small audience (including her new boss, LVMH head Bernard Arnault) was a love poem to her hometown. She even named it ""Manhattan Blues.""</p><p>New York can be chilly in the winter, and Karan, who loves dramatic outerwear, provided plenty of coats to choose from. The show started with a gorgeous, glistening calf number, continued through a great napa-leather trench, and closed with a cozy ivory cashmere jacquard. Next to the body, meanwhile, the designer likes a soft, silky layer—hence her series of sexy, body-skimming skirts and dresses. These were constructed from an elegant patchwork of wool and silk jerseys, satin, georgette and velvet, sometimes all in the same dress. And as if to protect her customers from the city's harder edges, Karan showed cozy oversize cashmere knit pieces made for sinking into. Even her suits—there were a few short jackets paired with slim trousers—were cut on the bias to make movement easy, and had a bit of soft fringe hanging off the arm.</p><p>After the soft and sexy feel of her daywear, the unexpected glitz of some of Karan's evening pieces felt out of sync, especially in some of the odd appliqués. Overall, though, this was a collection guaranteed to chase the blues away.</p></div>"
43,fall,2002,f2002,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten visualizes women as a traveling sisterhood who roam the world picking up pieces of local costume as they continue their endless journey from season to season. At a guess, this fall, their long march has taken them to the far reaches of Eastern Europe—or thereabouts. Wherever, it's somewhere chilly, because the diaphanous Asian things they wore in summer have turned to heavy ethnic woolens and layers of garments—say, a jacket over a skirt over bloomers over thick leggings or massive shawls, embroidered in wool with chunky fringes over swinging coats.</p><p>What this creates is an almost pyramidal silhouette that obliterates the body but suggests a kind of ceremonial grandeur. One of Van Noten's signatures is the precious looking highly decorated scarf: this season's versions are embroidered and embellished with sequined patterns, and worn displayed on the front of the body like a religious garment. Elsewhere, the strengths of this collection were in the huge flounced skirts riding low on the hips, and in Van Noten's deft mixing of subtle colors and prints. In short, plenty to please his cult following of cross-cultural fashion nomads.</p></div>"
44,fall,2002,f2002,eley-kishimoto,"Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto represent London's cheerful tendency. Known for their exuberant print work and happily naive post-WW II styling, this husband-and-wife team has a business built on charm.</p><p>Having formerly presented their wares in a chatty afternoon tea-time setting, Eley Kishimoto took a chance on showing in a bigger gallery space for Fall. As ever, though, the joy of the collection was in the way it set off memories of clunky clothes we all wore, or saw our parents wear, in the '60s through the '80s. An Eley Kishimoto girl might sport a granny-ish print coat, knit beret and knee socks, thrown together with an innocent lack of regard for sex appeal. In the spirit of good humor, she'll go for a loopy rainbow-colored cardigan that suggests a distant relationship with a homey kitchen-sink rug, circa 1969. Checkerboard, circle and patchwork prints were much in evidence, in A-line corduroy skirts and pants and pretty silk skirts and dresses.</p><p>Underlying all this loving homespun stuff, though, these designers are savvy enough to be building business links with the outside world. The models were toting vanity cases, luncheon boxes and overhead-compartment wheelie bags designed for luggage manufacturer Globetrotter, done out in prints to match the clothes. Ditto the chirpy printed sneakers, cleverly done in collaboration with Converse.</p></div>"
45,fall,2002,f2002,emanuel-ungaro,"The job of Ungaro designer Giambattista Valli is to translate the richly exotic vision of his mentor, house founder Emanuel Ungaro, onto the ready-to-wear runway. Ungaro himself still designs the house's couture line where he explores his Parisian passion for femininity, luxe and the eclectic riches of the Orient and Africa. Valli's special knack, meanwhile, is for building a bridge between the sensibility of the house's older customer, and a hipper attitude that speaks to today's generation.</p><p>In his second collection for the company, Valli filtered Ungaro's north African, Chinese and hippie-deluxe romanticism into street-wearable shearlings inspired by djellabas, delicate printed chiffon floor-length caftan dresses and chinoiserie coats without skipping the all-important edge of embellishment. Where he best reached out to a younger audience though was in a treasure-trove of accessories that cried, ""Hunt me now!"" Stack-heeled, crumple-down suede boots, huge woven leather shoulder bags loaded with swishing fringe, silk rope and tassels, necklaces strung together from chunks of coral, beaten silver hearts slung on raw leather thongs—all are up there on the trophy-hunter's list for fall.</p></div>"
46,fall,2002,f2002,emilio-pucci,"Like a classic rock band whose fans only want to hear the hits, Pucci will forever be expected to produce variations on its swirling, colorful prints. Not that that's a bad thing; few fashion statements command such instant recognition. But making a serious sportswear collection from a breezy, humorous pattern is a tough project.</p><p>In his third season at Pucci, designer Julio Espada achieved mixed results. Inspired by the smart, minimal fashions of '60s London, he kept silhouettes mostly simple and close to the body, using jersey fabrics and minimal embellishment. There were nifty dresses and poet-sleeve tops that would jazz up Fall's predominantly black palette, as well as a few sharp jackets and a new Pop-influenced print. But the generally serious mood, and some odd color combinations like yellow and burgundy or aquamarine and orange, seemed at odds with Pucci's sunny, Mediterranean personality.</p></div>"

48,fall,2002,f2002,emporio-armani,"Few collections designed for real women at accessible prices ever get into the international fashion spotlight, but Emporio Armani does. The label once had the feel of a junior second line, but now the remit of Emporio has broadened to span the everyday lifestyle needs of women across a wide age range.</p><p>For Fall 2002, Emporio showed coats for every occasion from tough, fur-edged, black jackets, through roomy macintoshes with asymmetric sporty zippers to more formal, precisely fitted wool princess coats. While a masculine theme incorporated an oversized jacket shown with slouchy wide pants and mannish vests with cutaway racer backs, it was the Emporio advance on the feminine front that came as more of a surprise. High heels—a sighting as rare as the unicorn on an Armani runway—appeared in an extensive evening section that featured easy-to-wear velvet jackets and skirts, some with paper-bag waistlines and wide-sleeved blouses cut to slide on the body. But when bare dresses with plunging necklines edged in bugle beads ended the show, the audience was in shock: sex is turning up in some very unexpected places this season.</p></div>"
49,fall,2002,f2002,fendi,"Call it barbarian deluxe. Fendi's women are a tribe of warrior goddesses storming in from the woods with the season's most-prized fur trophies slung about their shoulders. At first sight these furs, with their raggedy raw edges, wild textures and sprouting tufts might look primitive, but the techniques lavished on them are the ultimate in sophistication.</p><p>""We cut the fur to shreds and then knitted it to treat it like a fabric to give it lightness and movement,"" explained Karl Lagerfeld, about a series of shrug-on coats and huge one-armed stoles, devised to be flung around the body as easily as blankets. A fur bolero, worn back to front with pieces flying behind, was worn by Frankie Rayder; a piebald cross-bred knitted mink bobbed on the shoulders of Devon Aoki, and a vast knitted fox stole trailed dramatically from the neck of Jacquetta Wheeler. Inventing new mixes of pelts and casual ways of wearing fur was the Fendi sisters original big idea, and Lagerfeld has kept their expertise at the leading edge of fashion since the 60s. At a time when many houses are marching forward by retrieving a sense of their own past, Sylvia Fendi said,""it was a very emotional show. We wanted to go back to our roots.""</p></div>"

51,fall,2002,f2002,gianfranco-ferre,"The architect of Milanese designers, Gianfranco Ferré thinks structurally and visualizes his designs around the image of an Amazonian diva. His Fall 2002 collection hit all the signature notes of his career, both in Italy and at Dior in Paris, and bore witness to his lifelong creative obsession with white shirts, the uses of leather, innovative tailoring and Japanese-influenced details.</p><p>For day, Ferré's updates looked best in a beige, rough-textured cardigan that wrapped over a white shirt and cinched at the waist with a leather obi, shown with pants, and in a belted, black, fur-lined sweat-jacket with a tight skirt cut with a kick flounce in back. His bias-cut Prince of Wales check pantsuits, meanwhile, showed his fiercely immaculate expertise in tailoring. For evening, Ferré's operatic Italian leanings were indulged in an entrance-making white organza blouse, one sleeve blooming with a cascade of ruffles like an overblown flower. Ferré also addressed the new Fall trend for pushing knitwear into uncharted territory by converting chiffon and taffeta into yarn and knitting them into complex open-stitched evening skirts and gowns.</p></div>"
52,fall,2002,f2002,giorgio-armani,"""No to excess, no to overdone nudity; no to the obvious and commonplace, no to sensationalism""—these words are Giorgio Armani's creative response to the realities of life post 9/11.</p><p>Armani's vision has always been about melding the utilitarian practicality of menswear with the softening influence of innovative fabric as evidenced in his first sequence of gray herringbone and Prince of Wales jackets shown with fluid pants. The soft-but-strong structure of an Armani jacket is a design landmark, and he emphasized it throughout cutting neatly fitting shapes with slightly pointed shoulders. Bellboy looks, short spencers and strap-fastened jackets were all teamed with voluminous pants, and many outfits were accessorized with the designer's new bags (the best was a large, dark brown leather boxy oblong style with handles). Through over eighty looks, Armani experimented with variations on the trouser theme from harem pants to knickers to pleat-fronted styles. He even pushed the design of the baggiest pants so that they appeared as a kind of skirt caught into stirrups near floor-level.</p><p>For evening, Armani sparkled via bugle-beaded bustiers, cutaway sequin dresses over pants and—the shining standout—a silver beaded jacket with a matching flower in the lapel.</p></div>"
53,fall,2002,f2002,givenchy,"Julien Macdonald has been handed the mandate to carve out a distinct, but commercially-viable identity for the house of Givenchy. For Fall—his second collection as creative director— Macdonald brought in a few of the design ideas currently making the rounds. Patchwork, handkerchief-point chiffon dresses, biker jackets and the somewhat exhausted Casbah look all made an appearance.</p><p>Macdonald opened with a grayish-brown distressed leather patchwork parka worn with gray leather pants and stacked knee-high boots. His take on biker leathers involved cutting and seaming the jacket short and close to the body, then adding an Elizabethan-style standup collar. There were also Walter Raleigh-esque bloomers worn with swashbuckling boots, English country house tapestries fashioned into coats and bags, Gloriana-style gilded brocade jeans and a tights-and-tunic look perhaps inspired by a few late-night Errol Flynn movies.</p><p>When he exerts his skills in knitwear—his original claim to fame—Macdonald does best, as he demonstrated briefly in this collection with a huge loopy black sweater and some laddered punk knits. But he quickly returned to glitzier looks, like a lame harem jumpsuit, a gold-edged djellaba coat and some café-au-lait-toned satins for evening. It was hard to find a uniting theme other than a feeling for the Eighties. But fashion skewered that decade to death a year ago, and there is still a sense that this collection is struggling to find a raison d'etre.</p></div>"
54,fall,2002,f2002,gucci,"In her skinny, skinny satin pants, vicious pointy ankle-strapped heels, tousled hair and falling-off-the-shoulder tops, the Gucci rock-chick is here stomping on stage for her come-back gig. And why not? When Tom Ford cut his smash-hits for Gucci in the mid-90s, they were for a woman with a fearlessly rockin’ attitude and a taste for dangerous luxe. Now she’s back with an even bigger, richer lineup of killer clothes to flaunt.</p><p>Ford lavishes the luxury in new larger volumes that run from a chunky black knit with fur embedded in the seams to zigzag jacquard kimono jackets pulled in with obi belts, and a black satin blouson jacket worn with a sexy, tight pencil skirt. There are lean pants cut with a natural waist and so long they crumple at the ankle, or leg-lengthening flares that flow over the foot. The outerwear pieces, like big raincoats and oversize “boyfriend” jackets, get a touch of glam with satin trim.</p><p>Ford lists his sources as the Hollywood of the ’20s and ’30s, a touch of Goth and an antique kimono collected on a trip to Japan, but his own obsession comes through in the intense details. “This is the most worked collection I’ve ever done at Gucci,” he said. “Women are only buying amazing items now. No one’s buying anything basic.”</p></div>"
55,fall,2002,f2002,hamish-morrow,"Was it the challenge of scaling the heights of a new fashion career that inspired Hamish Morrow? Shown in the depths of an underground car park, his 16-outfit collection, entitled ""Safety, Security, Suspension,"" referenced climbing as a central theme. Harnesses studded with Swarovski crystal were clipped to pants, and real climbers' rope was lashed around skirts and torsos.</p><p>Morrow's aesthetic is in the British intellectual mode, crossing the boundaries between traditional fabrics and hi-tech materials. His skill in experimental pattern engineering was evident in asymmetrical dresses and skirts layered over jersey body pieces, accessorized with bright Nike knee socks and flat sporty shoes. Rounded, enveloping jackets with curved seaming developed the idea of clothes to protect and cocoon the body, while Morrow's free-thinking approach to color juxtaposed conservative gray menswear fabrics, like Prince of Wales and melton, with neon yellow and magenta Gore-Tex. His finale was an outfit knitted entirely of nylon rope.</p><p>After four seasons, Morrow has established support from other top-ranking industry talents like Eugene Souleiman, who dressed the girls' hair in textured off-center ponytails, and makeup artist Lucia Peroni, who dabbed splashes of bright paint on their faces and ears. But survival on the London scene is an extreme sport: So far, Hamish Morrow is inching upward without the safety net of financial backing.</p></div>"
56,fall,2002,f2002,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang’s minimal take on power dressing has become a de facto uniform for the artsy executive set—the kind of customers who need to look cool but serious while hopping time zones and board meetings. His Fall collection, done primarily in black and white, is sure to keep them happy.</p><p>Lang always cuts a mean jacket, and this season’s version has a slightly built-up shoulder and narrower waist, in keeping with the changing silhouette. (He kept the pants long and lean.) Hoods were in plentiful supply, some on his well-known narrow-fitting coats and others on soft, oversized sweaters. Slashed and layered jersey pieces, meanwhile, added a tougher edge to the looks. The best group was a series of intricately twisted takes on fishermen’s sweaters, with oversized cables and random slashes, done in black or white chunky wool.</p><p>A lot of the collection felt familiar, and there were some odd pieces, like metallic pleated skirts, that might not fly past the occasional gallery opening. But Lang’s more straightforward looks will certainly satisfy his loyal following.</p></div>"

58,fall,2002,f2002,imitation-of-christ,"After last season's turn-the-tables collection, where models and editors traded places, Imitation of Christ went to the other extreme for Fall 2002. Set in that bastion of Upper East Side elegance, Sotheby's, the show drew a crowd that included Lou Reed, Jimmy Fallon, Natasha Lyonne, and avant-garde muse Isabella Blow. The audience was given catalogs that detailed the 31 outfits, each named for a piece of contemporary art and written up as if it were going on the block. The actual garments did finally appear, on models who adopted frozen poses on a rotating stage as an auctioneer took bids.</p><p>There were some charming pieces on display: lovely Grecian-draped dresses, a fetching skirt that looked as though it were made from an embroidered tablecloth, even a kicky little black lace skirt perfect for IoC fans like Lyonne or Chloë Sevigny. But in an era full of pastiche, handcraft and ethnic references, when IoC should be at the top of its game, the clothes were unfortunately overshadowed by the heavy-handed commentary on Big Issues.</p><p>At the end of the show, the lights dimmed and green lasers began playing around the room to the strains of Pink Floyd. When one fashion editor took out his lighter and held it up, in the classic ""Freebird"" gesture, it was hard not to feel as though you were trapped in freshman year of high school.</p></div>"

60,fall,2002,f2002,jean-paul-gaultier,"Brown paper packages tied up with strings; these are a few of Jean Paul Gaultier’s favorite things for fall. His runway was wrapped up in sheeting like a Christo art piece and the models bundled and bound like parcels in transit. Hangers and Stockman dress forms—the dummies used for fitting clothes—circulated on an overhead track so the girls could take off and put on jackets and coats as they strutted.</p><p>Gaultier used the packaging motif to bisect jackets, wrap the torsos in asymmetrically hemmed tunics, and bind legs in leather, as if with packing tape. The joke continued with trompe l’oeil outfits made to look as if the models were half-submerged in mail bags or leopard-spotted women caught up in net, human versions of exotic animals traveling in the luggage hold. Gaultier’s life-preserver gilets in puffy nylon or mink, and a tailored jumpsuit under a leather bomber jacket, strung out the in-transit story. The strongest pieces he delivered are in synch with the season’s trends: the skinniest green-washed jeans, crumpled at the ankle and long enough to hide the shoe, and his tailcoat, cut as a vest with a bolero jacket on top. But cutting loose from over-themed design would modernize his presentation no end.</p></div>"
61,fall,2002,f2002,jeremy-scott,"Jeremy Scott's New York debut ended fashion week with a jolt of high energy and—in a week of monochromatic, subdued tones—vivid color.</p><p>The Missouri-born designer, who came to fame in Paris before relocating to Los Angeles, chose New York to show his largest—and most commercially viable—collections to date. And while Scott may not be ready for prime time, he certainly entertained a jaded audience.</p><p>Scott opened with a series of very mini coats and dresses in amped-up sherbet tones, all infused with his Grace Jones–meets–Judy Jetson spirit (read: sky-high collars and exaggerated, cartoonish shoulder treatments). While the silhouettes were futuristic, the fabrics were resolutely traditional: wool felt, leather and soft jersey. One coat, a sheared mink wrap shown on an otherwise naked model, was basically a furry fig leaf. And while they were wacky, the clothes were well constructed: The manufacture was overseen by a former employee of the notoriously picky designer James Galanos.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hubtbj""></div></div><p>Scott's tongue-in-cheek attitude was very apparent, but he's also showing a new maturity as a designer. After the far-out coats, he showed a group of knit dresses that were eminently wearable. But those who lean to the left of fashion center shouldn't worry that Scott, who used to end his shows with a cry of ""Vive l'avant garde!"" has sold out. He ended the presentation with a group of elaborately constructed dresses designed to resemble New York City skyscrapers. If Björk needs something to wear to the Oscars, she need look no further.</p></div>"
62,fall,2002,f2002,jil-sander,"The name Jil Sander has always been a touchstone to subtle-minded, confident women who demand rigor and sophistication in their clothes. With Milan Vukmirovic in the design seat, the label has seen an infusion of comfort and color to which its avid followers should have no problem relating.</p><p>For Fall, the essential Sander values were reflected in two immaculate white coats, one in a bathrobe shape with a knitted collar, the other cut collarless in double-face cashmere. A strong line in office-appropriate cardigan knits ran through the show sometimes matched with long ribbed scarves and beanie hats. Those desperately seeking an interesting pantsuit, meanwhile, will find it in sand-colored needlecord, tailored on the bias with a stand-up collar—a creative twist on one of fall's ubiquitous fabrics. New to this formerly stark collection is the influx of the color purple and a concentration on feminine eveningwear—most successfully in a simple black velvet knee-length dress with long gathered sleeves, and a sweatshirt worn over a narrow beaded floor-length skirt.</p><p>Vukmirovic is not an abstract thinker, but he brought a new warmth to the collection by paying attention to the ideas of the women who surround him. ""The color purple came from listening to Prince,"" he said. ""The rest was my women friends telling me they wanted the knitwear, jogging pieces and scarves we'd done in the menswear collection.""</p></div>"
63,fall,2002,f2002,john-galliano,"It would take more words than are in this entire review to fully describe any single outfit in John Galliano's thundering, swirling, multi-everything Fall collection. ""Eskimo and Mongolian hotties! Keep the fur flying!"" was the backstage prompt to Galliano's tribe as they marauded out to flaunt patchworked and rose-embroidered shearlings, extra-flouncy skirts, chiffons, bobbly striped knits and a whole load more in the delighted faces of an audience that included Lenny Kravitz and Kate Moss.</p><p>Galliano likes to tease commentators by keeping a couple of leagues ahead of their ability to document his continent-hopping inspiration, basic-to-deluxe materials and bewildering repertoire of techniques. Suffice it to say that this show included Chinese brocade and dragon-head motifs, Spanish fringe, Scottish tartan, Peruvian pom-poms, American-Indian moccasins, lace-printed denim, salmon skin, satin embroidery, rough-hewn fur, and feathers.</p><p>Galliano is amongst the small band of designers who stand up for the value of individuality in a season when color, workmanship and the confidence of singular points of view have been all too frequently stifled by commercial pressure. The irony, of course, is that single pieces from this collection will look far more seductive on a store rack than any number of black cashmere turtlenecks.</p></div>"
64,fall,2002,f2002,julien-macdonald,"It's been a long time since models took it as part of their job description to va-va-voom to the end of the runway, throw a pose and come on to the photographers in a ""fabulous me"" kind of way. So long, indeed, that the joy-starved London crowd was seized by a sudden gratitude to Julien Macdonald for putting on a show that included go-for-it girls, glitter, gold and, yes, glam rock.</p><p>In a take-no-prisoners collection, Macdonald referenced the '70s heyday of David Bowie and Jerry Hall in flashy embroidered jackets, leopard spots, shaggy fox furs, sexy knickers, jumpsuits and unbuttoned satin vests. Exaggerated Bowie quiffs, big teased hairdos and fuchsia lipstick turned up Macdonald's aesthetic to full volume, a message that will be heard loud and clear by women who also love Versace and Roberto Cavalli.</p><p>What's the difference for Macdonald between designing in London and at Givenchy in Paris? ""I can be cheeky and sexy and take risks here,"" he said. ""Paris is bourgeois; in London, it's more fun. I'm swinging back to the old days of David Bowie and Anita Pallenberg, when British celebrity ruled the world. I just wanted to show my respect for London by showing here.""</p></div>"
65,fall,2002,f2002,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe's audience descended into the perma-gloom of the Salle Wagram, a turn-of-the-century venue off the Champs Élysées. The former music hall proved the perfect setting for Watanabe's elegiac—though far from morbid—show.</p><p>Watanabe's collection was composed almost entirely of dusty-gray '30s-styled dresses in satin, cotton and velvet, often bias cut and/or backless, and always in an artful state of distress. Hems were riddled with holes, as though the gray-lipsticked wearers had walked away from some disaster in their sturdy leather biker boots and crooked, incinerated Edwardian hats. The designer used patchworked textures of black, a minute sprinkle of silver beading on an embroidered dress, and a beautiful layering of black lace to veil a silver lining. Among the drifting horde of dresses were a couple of jackets, ridged with seaming in the technique Watanabe used for denim in his Spring show, and a stellar full-length raincoat full of drama and mystery.</p><p>Watanabe, who said after the show that he ""was feeling in the dark,"" may be reacting to the current state of the world. But he's a sensitive soul, more prone to bursts of cheerfulness than angst, and the collection came across as delicate and melancholy rather than doom-laden.</p></div>"
66,fall,2002,f2002,katayone-adeli,"Unlike some of the designers she's often grouped with, Katayone Adeli doesn't attack the latest trends with a sledgehammer; she checks in with the current mood and then goes off and quietly puts her own idiosyncratic slant on it. That's what has made her a star to the hip young women who stock up on her ever-popular pants and ultra-feminine dresses.</p><p>Adeli's Fall collection was true to form. The tiny, casual presentation she did at the last minute let editors see the clothes up close—all the better to admire the intricate passementerie on a fitted black wool jacket, the delicate smocking on a brown velvet top and the whimsy of a chunky, grandma-made-it sweater coat. While Adeli tends to think in terms of items rather than collections, she did work in a few tailored jackets that, paired with those low-slung trousers, would make a top-to-toe outfit for a major occasion. But this season's star is likely to be Adeli's take on that '70s classic, the army-green parka, which she sweetened with a sepia-toned wallpaper-print lining.</p></div>"
67,fall,2002,f2002,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole's expanding womenswear business is aimed at the same young fashion lovers who've taken so well to his footwear and accessories—well enough, in fact, to make him one of the industry's more successful publicly held companies.</p><p>The designer's Fall collection will not disappoint them, ranging as it did from trim pinstripe sweaters and boot-cut velvet jeans to slim jersey dresses and low-slung pencil skirts in tweed, suede, denim and leather. Cole did well with leather—as might be expected from a shoe-making veteran—showing looks like a glossy brown double-breasted trench and a supple camel suede jacket with red topstitching.</p><p>There were a few misfires, such as the tweed cargo knickers that opened the show and the heavy, hip-length Shaker knit tunics. And the short, preachy film titled <em>September 11, 2001</em> that opened the proceedings could have been dropped. But the clothes, fortunately, were message-free.</p></div>"
68,fall,2002,f2002,lagerfeld-gallery,"If idle hands are the devil's playground, Karl Lagerfeld is destined for sainthood. There's the Chanel and Fendi jobs, not to mention innumerable collaborations, photo projects, drawings, furniture designs, books, houses—OK, he's busy. But never too busy, it seems, to play with some fashion ideas. Which is where Lagerfeld Gallery comes in. Lagerfeld Gallery started out as a group of items shown at his Left Bank art gallery (hence the name), but has since evolved into a true collection.</p><p>Lagerfeld is particularly good at taking one or two big ideas and looking at them from all sides. For Fall, he played off two of the season's favorite icons: denim and black dresses. The famously slimmed-down designer clearly wanted to share his rediscovery of all things skinny. At the heart of the collection were skintight blue jeans (created for Lagerfeld by Diesel), boot-cut or as knickers and worn with teetering heels. He paired those with fitted jackets, crisp white shirts or black knit tops—perfect dressing for a woman who likes uncomplicated style that still packs a punch. When she's feeling a bit more like playing the sex kitten, Lagerfeld's customer will change into one of his satiny, figure-hugging black dresses or skirts and add a slouchy bag from another of the season's collaborators, accessories designer Matt Murphy. Simple ideas, made new and interesting—that's how Karl keeps his fashion wheels rolling.</p></div>"
69,fall,2002,f2002,lanvin,"With his first collection for Lanvin, Alber Elbaz successfully walked the finest of lines between design panache and desirable, grown-up clothes. Leaving a chic margin of raw edge on the most luxurious of fabrics, and cutting a beautiful compromise between the fierce and the feminine, he pulled off a feat of styling that augurs well for the future.</p><p>Elbaz opened his show with a dark brown, double-face coat with an irregular cascade of sequin running down the front. It was a signal that quality would be honored, but also energized with a shot of free-form creativity. That thread was developed via wrapper coats in, for example, slubby brown tweed with an unfinished edge running down the front, and in the way he frayed the edges of what might otherwise have been a matronly combination of a camelhair cape and dress. Elbaz’s sequence of chiffon dresses in subtle washes of neutral color were beautifully done, bound with multiple leather belts and held on by effortlessly complex twists and knots in the shoulder details. With their unhemmed edges—and especially when they were shown with high, pointy distressed leather spat-boots—they channeled ballerinas and pagan goddesses (and perhaps Claire McCardell) without seeming in the least bit fey.</p><p>Elbaz spanned luxe and casual by showing how good fur can look if worn simply with a gray tracksuit and high heels. He also cleverly put immaculate oversize overcoats over matching pantsuits with a mannish cut—a subtle reference to Lanvin’s identity as a successful seller of men’s suits. This was an optimistic start to a new chapter in Elbaz’s career (he was formerly at Guy Laroche, YSL Rive Gauche, and Krizia) and he was loudly applauded for it.</p></div>"
70,fall,2002,f2002,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele, an American who has lived in Milan since he first designed for Prada in the late eighties, pulled ideas from the thirties through the seventies into a collection for shoppers who demand a shot of opulence in their fashion cocktail.</p><p>Steele hit a glam sporty note with tracksuits made of burgundy crushed velvet; for extra flash, the evening version came in a strapless gold lame. Worn with high heels and Lurex socks, and maybe a little knit cloche jammed on the head, these are clearly clothes for girls who get their workouts on the dance floor. Short printed or sheer dresses with big sleeves slid off the shoulder and were hitched at the waist with tasseled silk rope belts, while a gold Lurex turtleneck came with a long trailing scarf to match. Underscored with off-hand furs—most successfully, a rabbit bomber and a shaggy patchwork coyote coat—the overall effect was kooky-deluxe. And when Steele turned on Princess Superstar's outrageously suggestive ""Bad Babysitter"" rap, the audience had trouble hiding its blushes.</p></div>"
71,fall,2002,f2002,loewe,"Madrid-based leather goods house Loewe—owned by fashion conglomerate LVMH—is attempting to work that now-commonplace fashion strategy: hire a young, critically acknowledged designer to create a buzz-generating ready-to-wear line, thereby boosting a venerable brand into a global powerhouse (see also Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, etc.)</p><p>José Enrique Oña Selfa's maiden effort as the house designer was a decent attempt. He seemed most comfortable when he stuck to his home ground of knitwear, or played up the house's ability with skins. Simple sportswear shapes rendered in butterscotch or vanilla-toned hides and fitted shearling coats with seams detailed in contrast leather didn't break any style ground, but will certainly speak to luxury leather fans everywhere. And though Oña Selfa lost his way with awkward knee-length hobble skirts and release-pleat wide leg trousers, the creamy wide leather belts and smartly constructed bags that ornamented many of the looks could be the start of a beautiful business.</p></div>"
72,fall,2002,f2002,louis-vuitton,"At Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs found a way to surprise and delight by turning his attention to the neglected middle ground between the glamorous and the everyday. Using a delicate, almost-there color palette and perfectly calibrated details, Jacobs conjured a sense of filtered 1950’s glamour that was never so exaggerated as to become literal.</p><p>The elegant and the rumpled were literally fused in the designer’s first two outfits, trompe l’oeil dresses that joined silky tops to knee-length alpaca skirts perfectly accessorized with satin Louis heel slingbacks. A throw-it-on attitude toward the ultra-luxe was cultivated throughout, especially via herringbone tweed pencil skirts with washed silk camisoles and casual white rabbit bombers. Jacobs paid attention to the LV monogram by scattering it discreetly over a black silk bomber paired with a sexy tight skirt, or embedding it in the little metallic mesh shoulder bag— this season’s quiet, yet undisputed monogram statement.</p><p>There was room for pure luxury, too, in crinkled lamé tops or sheared mink skirts banded with silver sequins. But the measure of Jacobs’ success in holding back from overstatement was in the way he made the appearance of a deep red cashmere cardigan—or the simplicity of a deep rose lipstick—suddenly seem like the height of glamour.</p></div>"
73,fall,2002,f2002,luella,"After a brief excursion across the prairie this Spring, Luella Bartley returned to the city for Fall, with a smart collection aimed at prepsters with a rock 'n' roll edge.</p><p>Bartley clearly spent time in study hall; she has the preppy vocabulary down cold, from three-quarter coats with toggle closures to navy poplin pieces with red topstitching. Also on the syllabus were pinstripe shirts, chunky wine-colored sweaters, soft corduroys and lots and lots of denim (including the show opener, a mini-trench worn by Gisele).</p><p>Although the collection was entitled ""Some Girls"" (the Rolling Stones were featured on a CD given out to accompany the show), Bartley can clearly be mother's little helper, too. Sweet jersey dresses, a simple navy sweater that buttons up the sleeves or a swinging, boxy black-and-white jacket easily jump the generation gap. And moms with hippie inclinations will definitely want to sneak into their daughters' closets for the superfly fringed belts by Katie Hillier or the nifty white sheepskin jacket.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ym8fj6""></div></div><p>While some of the '70s references were stretched too far—like a poncho made from red leather hearts crocheted together—the collection as a whole put a fresh, modern spin on some ever-popular classics.</p></div>"
74,fall,2002,f2002,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"It's rare for a secondary line to establish its own identity as distinctly as Marc by Marc Jacobs. Now going into its fourth season, the ultratrendy label has won the hearts of Jacobs' collection customers, not to mention the retailers who've watched his creased jeans and striped sweaters fly off their shelves. Even better, Marc has become a cult brand among fashion-savvy (is there any other kind?) high school girls.</p><p>For Fall, the designer remained true to his favorite decade, the '70s. A master of the artfully mismatched, Jacobs assembled deceptively simple, layered looks in those odd '70s color combos like blue/rust and brown/purple. (He even worked in a floral thermal shirt, putting it under a short-sleeve turtleneck.) As always there was plenty of denim, although corduroy and velvet also made their presence felt in jackets, skirts and flare-leg jeans; these had a line artfully bleached out around the hem, so they looked like they'd been shortened and then let down. Rounding out the collection were knee-length skirts, close-fitting blazers, baseball jackets, zip-front cardigans, great three-quarter coats and rainbow-striped sweaters, all accessorized with long knit fringed scarves.</p><p>Worn all together on the runway, the line looked fantastic. And real-world customers who limit themselves to individual pieces—there is, otherwise, a slight risk of being mistaken for Marcia Brady—are sure to be happy.</p></div>"
75,fall,2002,f2002,marc-jacobs,"For many at Marc Jacobs' show tonight, it was hard to forget that the last time this gathering took place was September 10. And while some of the outer trappings were the same—the star-studded front row included the likes of Anthony Kiedis, Sofia Coppola, and Kirsten Dunst—a sense of how things have changed permeated the event. The colorful high spirits of Jacobs' Spring collection have gone, replaced by subdued, achingly beautiful designs that are bound to be among the season's most coveted.</p><p>This was a delicate, even ethereal collection that made judicious use of Edwardian touches—seen in the velvet skirts and sheer black tea gowns—and military details like reverse lapels and piping on tailored trousers. The silhouette was long and lean, and most looks were made up of multiple layers—a dress over a T-shirt and trousers, with a waistcoat, for example. But Jacobs balanced his fabrics perfectly, ballasting the featherweight chiffons, cashmeres, crinkly lamé and satin with velveteen, crisp cotton, brocade, and cavalry twill. The palette was limited to shades of ivory and khaki, with occasional shots of azure, wine, or crimson—mostly looks for women, with about a quarter devoted to his growing menswear line.</p><p>Like a sunny Sunday morning after a long Saturday night, the collection was lovely, if slightly tinged with melancholy. But if the silver-sequined dazzler of a dress that closed the show is any indication, Jacobs is more than ready for all tomorrow's parties.</p></div>"
76,fall,2002,f2002,marjan-pejoski,"In an effort, perhaps, to escape forever being known as the designer of Björk's Oscars swan dress, Macedonian-born, London-based designer Marjan Pejoski fled the scene of the crime, as it were, and staged his Fall 2002 collection in Paris.</p><p>While Pejoski's beaded re-creation of Indian erotica recalled the designer's Spring 2001 collection (which featured Disney cartoon characters in pornographic poses), this show was rated PG. Suede anklets and boots gave a Peter Pan feel to coats and dresses that bloomed with embroidered foliage, flowers and butterfly wings. Pejoski's signature beadwork added some flash throughout, while patchwork jackets looked like they had been crafted by a savage child with a natural gift for needlework. The collection was strongest when it combined whimsy with discipline, as in the navy man-sized, sleeveless jacket embroidered with water lilies.</p><p>Though Pejoski's collection was very much attuned to London's current <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fixation, it nonetheless marked a development in the designer's career, showing that he could deliver a signature collection without gimmicks.</p></div>"
77,fall,2002,f2002,markus-lupfer,"Markus Lupfer's collection, shown in a lofty church in Notting Hill, was inspired by woodland nymphs, fairies and elves—part of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> tendency that is surfacing here and there this season.</p><p>Lupfer may have delved into his German romantic imagination for the storybook sources of this show, but what he produces is always done with a light, accessible spin. He mixed browns, dusty pinks and soft, iridescent greens in layerings of antique leather and chiffon that moved his collection out of the ladylike mode he established in the late '90s, and into something hipper. For Fall, his emphasis was on texture and detail: pony-skin jackets, nut-brown leather skirts that showed a kick of black-and-white print in the pleats, delicate lace-printed chiffon dresses over cashmere sweaters. Standouts were his coats, especially a swinging modernized riding coat seamed to curve into the waist and a geometrically pieced brown-and-black felt patchwork overcoat studded with wooden beads. With the addition of tribal-influenced braids and leather and coin jewelry, the result was a boho look Lupfer's Portobello followers will relate to.</p></div>"
78,fall,2002,f2002,marni,"Consuelo Castiglioni is the pied piper of gentle whimsy, drawing an ever-growing crowd of followers along her personal fashion path. Marni’s clothes never seem brand new, but come across instead like a haul of pretty vintage things remade and remixed with a naïve hand.</p><p>For fall, the Marni trip is all about faded multicolored bedspread patchworks, printed silk, chiffon and plaids that have been through the wash and come out soft and crinkled. Innocent cotton smocks, ’70s-feel suede patchwork coats, tiny brown suede jackets and capes were mixed up with cropped pants and fragile blouses with trailing asymmetric hems and chiffon scarves. Marni collectors will love the childlike spontaneity of details like the random placing of a bunny-rabbit appliqué, or the fact that some of the clothes are worn inside out with the seams showing. But this collection was hardly the answer to a poor girl’s dreams. Castiglione married into a family of furriers, and she hewed to the family tradition by working in unlined mink (worn with the patchworked piecing on the outside), cropped tenuki fur jackets, a feathery striped fox coat, and raw-edged wallaby stoles that tie on with ribbons.</p></div>"
79,fall,2002,f2002,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon's stock in trade is her oh-so-Parisian ability to confidently mix disparate elements, producing all those ""How do they do it?"" outfits that make women from other cultures pine. At her best, she blends flea market chic, historic references, an urban toughness and a wispy femininity to produce pieces that are distinctive, yet don't overwhelm the wearer.</p><p>Sitbon's fall collection, done mostly in black with occasional forays into gray, ivory and lavender tones, contained a lot of those signature looks. There were strong-shouldered jackets nipped at the waist, slim trousers, a silk bomber jacket and some pretty, fluid asymmetrical skirts and dresses. True, there was no shortage of oddball pieces—like chopped-off jodhpurs with flaring cuffs or an ivory skirt with a hiked-up hem—that seemed tricky and gratuitous. But weary closets could be easily refreshed by a puckered, sheer sweater, or one of the dip-dyed, screen-printed, artsy-girl dresses.</p></div>"
80,fall,2002,f2002,matthew-williamson,"Showing in New York for the first time, Londoner Matthew Williamson presented a collection titled ""Kaleidescape"" that arrived just like a Gypsy caravan might: embellished to the max and bursting with color.</p><p>Shocking, tropical hues of rose, peach, yellow and turquoise brightened trenchcoats, minis and pants—low-slung and tapered, or wide-waled and bell-bottomed—while shredded chiffon skirts were swirling patchworks of pattern and hue. Williamson's talisman this season was the number five (marking the number of years he's been in business), which was patched onto pockets, bags, trenches and military-style jackets. The designer's favorite Eastern motifs, like paisleys and abstract florals, made their way onto the beautiful hand-embroidered coat worn by Alek Wek and the chiffon dresses (really strapless saris) that closed the evening. Less successful were his continuing experiments with activewear, especially this season's Airtex dresses.</p><p>Williamson's pretty, if somewhat predictable, show included pieces that should appeal to both his established clientele and to younger (albeit deep-pocketed) customers. It will be interesting to see if he can develop a new audience by winning over typically black-clad New Yorkers.</p></div>"
81,fall,2002,f2002,max-mara,"The camel-hair coat is an icon for MaxMara; the foundation upon which one of Italy's most successful family fashion empire was built. The exercise each fall is to find new context in which to frame that timeless piece. This season's version is a creamy, floorsweeping topper flying loose over tight, high-waisted velvet pants and a turtleneck.</p><p>MaxMara acts as a percolator for current trends, making them accessible to a city woman who spends her money on wearable investments but likes to nod to fashion. For fall, she'll find that in an Alaïa-influenced flounced skirt with a matching bomber jacket, a 70s pants suit with a neat blazer, an ethnic fur-lined gilet, or the quintessential retro brown stacked-heel knee boot. Last fall's Art Nouveau mood reappears as Klimt-influenced prints, and peacock feathers made into capelets, jackets or as decoration on dresses and blouses. That's just enough to show a general awareness of the direction of fashion but not overpower the house's classic values, which are rooted as much in the pleasure of cashmere, velvet and suede as in the practicalities of a busy woman's everyday life.</p></div>"
82,fall,2002,f2002,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors went right for the heart of his customer with a Fall show that blended elegant luxury with down-home comfort.</p><p>Inspired in part by ""the rustic glamour of Aspen,"" Kors designed a collection perfect for one of his smart urban customers who might jump on her Harley on Friday and zoom off to spend the weekend skiing at Stowe. For the trip up, she'll put on one of his tough-girl chic leather motorcycle jackets and his skintight cotton ripstop pants; once there, she'll undo the knee-to-ankle zipper to make a sharp boot-cut trouser, and throw on a quilted leather anorak and hand-painted jeans or a fluffy knee-length coyote vest to hang out in the lodge. Après-ski, she'll slip into a feather-light cashmere baby doll or a camel pointelle jersey dress for hearthside lounging.</p><p>Kors covered the work week beautifully as well, with double-face wool pieces like a generous clutch coat over a short wrap-front skirt, lightweight cashmere dresses and sweaters, or a chic suede coat and pants hand-painted in a herringbone pattern. The bonus prize? With all the smart-looking new menswear Kors showed, her boyfriend can look just as good as she does.</p></div>"
83,fall,2002,f2002,michelle-loweholder,"In an uncertain climate, some of London's new names are taking the now-or-never leap to the official runway, after several seasons of informal, off-schedule shows. One such is Michelle Lowe-Holder, a Canadian designer specializing in knitwear who made her way onto the London scene via the prestigious fashion school Central Saint Martins.</p><p>With sponsorship from London's New Generation scheme, Lowe-Holder put on a show that signaled a change in direction since her last appearance. Her asymmetrical knitwear, in a bubbly sparkle-shot chenille, made for interestingly odd-shaped, almost free-form capes and sweaters. But she also made an effort to move away from London's underground rawness to something more grown-up and chic, with flowing divided skirts in jersey, high-waisted, pleated pants and, most successfully, a full-length hooded bathrobe dress in matte gray sequin.</p><p>The strain of moving from low-key presentations to the full glare of the catwalk seemed to have put the designer under pressure to perform in a different character, leaving even some of her followers wondering who the real Michelle Lowe-Holder might be.</p></div>"
84,fall,2002,f2002,missoni,"It's a knit season and individuality has never been such a driving force in fashion. Put those two factors together and Missoni is perfectly poised to win the hearts of eclectic shoppers. Angela Missoni's talent for joining multicolored pattern and modern woman styling is the thread that runs exuberantly through this collection. She knits in references to artistic and folkloric cultures from all over the world—Peruvian stripes, a touch of the Tyrol, hints of Morocco and for a historical touch some right-on-trend art nouveau butterfly markings.</p><p>Missoni's knack is making this melee of stripes, zigzags, swirls and fringe into appealing urban clothing. There's a vertically striped multicolor ribbed dress suspended on straps and matched with a long scarf, a knit coat patterned like a swirly carpet, a djellaba cardigan with a zip front. Loopy yarn is made into a stole, while wooly South American-style fringing was a new note for one of the season's recurring themes. Pulled together with the soft browns, purples, greens and oranges of the moment and some great bags, Missoni is full of treasures for fashion's individualists to pick through and make their own.</p></div>"
85,fall,2002,f2002,miu-miu,"While Prada is designed for adult-only sexual sophisticates this season, Miu Miu is for the naughty little sister who has a saucy act all her own. This is a girl out to prove she can look provocative even in a beige raincoat, when it’s cut short and worn with head-turning hotpants and a cute sou’wester.</p><p>So what if she didn’t actually live through early ’70s? This expert young flirt makes free with quirky versions of fashions her mother knew so well. Styles like stiff culottes, doubleknit halter rompsuits, corduroy coats, chiffon blouses, and patch pockets applied in contrasting colors. All that cranberry, violet, brown, yellow and green. She adores the mumsy no-no of shiny quilting when it’s made up into a pair of nutty emerald green overalls or a nipped-in navy trench. And those cute little jackets that tie in the back to emphasize her trim curves are irresistible. But then, why should she exercise restraint? After all, life’s a blast when you’re in charge of a fab body and a pair of great legs.</p></div>"
86,fall,2002,f2002,moschino,"Like that bubbly blonde in the teen movies who manages to trump the smart alecks with one perfect aperçu, Moschino lightened up a somber fashion week with a breezy, pretty collection that left viewers smiling.</p><p>Michele Hicks opened the show with a saucy strut, her sexily mussed hair spilling onto a cool black parka and wrap dress. Much of the collection was black, but without being goth-heavy or industrial-serious; instead, flowing fabrics and trim silhouettes kept it feminine and light. Moschino creative director Rossella Jardini acknowledged the house's history by slinging a few of those gold block-letter MOSCHINO belts around the hips on her tailored looks, and by courageously, if not always successfully, mixing bold prints. There were a few overly fussy bloopers, like a droopy safari-styled jumpsuit and a surfeit of miscast ruffles. But for the most part, Jardini—like that typecast blonde—was clearly having fun.</p></div>"
87,fall,2002,f2002,narciso-rodriguez,"A few days before his show, Narciso Rodriguez said that he had taken inspiration from the work of legendary designer Cristobal Balenciaga, who combined masterful tailoring with simple but elegant designs. And in the superb collection he showed tonight, Rodriguez demonstrated his ability to bring those elements to a modern wardrobe.</p><p>Rodriguez kept the silhouette long and lean, contouring dresses and shirts to the body with clinging inset bodices and introducing an elongated tunic top. A minimalist by nature, his palette was white, black, cream, gray and gold, although there were—how shocking!—two blush-pink dresses. Boxy jackets with slightly rounded shoulders hung just to the waist of slightly flared, tailored trousers or knee-length pencil skirts; silky, fluid blouses wrapped loosely in front. Even Rodriguez's fur was restrained: He showed inky sheared mink pieces—a short jacket, a tunic, a narrow coat—that looked at first glance like particularly plush velvet.</p><p>For evening Rodriguez raised the glamour quotient a hair by simply adding a whiff of beading to a satin shirt, or offering a heavy gold pencil skirt. And as if that weren't enough, he sent out a group of satin glamour dresses, each with its own version of a ruffle at the back. Restrained, refreshing and quite beautiful.</p></div>"
88,fall,2002,f2002,oscar-de-la-renta,"No one would really have expected Oscar de la Renta to adopt the sober palette that's dominated the runways this week. But just in case there was any doubt, the designer announced his direction even before the first model appeared, projecting a mosaic of colorful photos taken at Moroccan open-air markets—fruits, flowers, spices—onto the stage front.</p><p>There was a whiff of far-flung exoticism throughout the collection, although it was grounded in city-smart sportswear. De la Renta started with nubby cashmere sweaters, limpid ruched tops and soft wool poet-sleeve blouses, paired with tailored flannel pants and skirts in gray, moss green, taupe and black. But almost every outfit got a touch of spice via embroidery, a dusting of sequins, even a cowrie-shell fringe, along with exotic belts trimmed in coins, studs or smooth horn buttons.</p><p>Beautiful, delicately decorated coats have become fixtures in de la Renta's collections, and this one was no exception: There were opulent styles, like the silk patchwork version lined with sheared mink, alongside low-key versions in black cashmere or silk twill with a light touch of embroidery or beading.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qsobc""></div></div><p>De la Renta ended, as always, with a parade of great eveningwear: simple lace dresses, densely ruffled skirts and a group of glorious, diaphanous blouses with generous poet sleeves—just the thing for midnight at the medina.</p></div>"
89,fall,2002,f2002,peter-som,"Peter Som, a Parson's graduate with a degree in art history, interned with Calvin Klein and Michael Kors before accepting a position with Bill Blass. One of the five designers singled out by <em>Vogue</em> as a member of ""generation next"" in their celebration of American fashion, Som's first show was a much anticipated event that did not</p><p>Som described the collection as ""fiercely feminine,"" and delivered on that promise with a show executed in a palette of navy and black that opened with Alek Wek in a strapped and buckled harness coat. Although the sharp-edged, hardware-embellished theme featured heavily, this confident collection was actually strongest in its softer moments. (It's hard to look at harnesses without thinking of Helmut Lang.)</p><p>Pieces like a midnight sheath worn with an embroidered obi, and a wrap skirt with floating ribbon streamers, were both pretty and sharp. Fluid slouch pants, paired with a tank and shearling vest-wrap, and a well-tailored wool smoking suit with innovative sleeve details, showcased the elegance and all-American ease for which Som is becoming known.</p></div>"
90,fall,2002,f2002,philosophy,"Last season she was a virgin. Since then, Alberta Ferretti's innocent girl has been allowed out to a couple of gigs, or maybe taken a year off to do some traveling. In any event, her summer of drifty white eyelet is over and she's turned the corner into a tougher kind of teenager. In her wardrobe now is an eclectic mix of Chinese jackets and vests, grunge-influenced plaid, and a lot of tiny smock dresses—but always worn with woolly ribbed tights and flat boots or shoes.</p><p>Ferretti's addition of menswear shirt stripes and distressed leather coats give this girl enough to wear when she wants to hang out with the cool gang, but she's still a sweetheart underneath it all. Those signature Empire-line coats and chiffon dresses are still true to her good-girl nature. Daddy, meanwhile, will be relieved to discover that his little girl's idea of great nightlife is still a pajama party.</p></div>"
91,fall,2002,f2002,pierrot,"No one could accuse Pierrot of lacking imagination. For his Fall 2002 show, the knitwear maven performed not one, but two transformations: He conjured a fairy-tale atmosphere from the dank interior of dance club Webster Hall, and he dressed just about every character from the Brothers Grimm in a nifty outfit.</p><p>Little Red Riding Hood sported a peaked hood, Snow White had a floor-length white skirt and the supporting cast of elves and toy soldiers each got snug, whimsically decorated sweaters, often paired with skin-tight knickers or ruffled skirts so short, they should rightfully be called tutus. The biggest crowd-pleaser, though, was elegant veteran model Carmen Dell'Orefice, who played Snow White's evil stepmom to the hilt, sweeping her black, spider-decorated cape across the floor as she enticed audience members with glistening red apples (no one took a bite).</p><p>For the more workaday heroines among us, Pierrot produced straightforward knitwear like sexy, body-hugging dresses, lacy crocheted knee-length skirts, puff-sleeve tops and a black sweater dress with white crocheted lace at the neck and cuffs. Pierrot is not afraid of color: The palette moved from red, white, blue and black to lavenders, green, brown and gray, before ending with—of course—a snowy white bride. Aside from a few overly heavy pieces like a cape weighed down by granny squares, Pierrot spun a pretty yarn, indeed.</p></div>"
92,fall,2002,f2002,prada,"Thank you, Miuccia Prada, for reminding us about sex. Tight skirts that show a woman’s shape, high crocodile boots, see-through macs, and models that are the antithesis of innocent waifs. All these factored into a collection that sent the fashion world spinning away from its current fixation with hippie peasant clichés.</p><p>In a show that was densely layered with references to the history of fashion, Prada cut a strong, curvaceous and erotically charged line to give grown-ups a whole new reason to buy. From the moment Eva Herzigova appeared, silhouetted in a black nylon bomber jacket with fur sleeves and a black, wickedly seamed skirt, it was obvious Prada had her sights set on a new kind of adult sophistication. High-waisted tweed skirts, bomber jackets cut to show the waist, and blouses with stiff puffed sleeves signaled her belief in the power of a new, hard chic. Revisiting structured tailoring—which is where she began in the ’90s—was only one of her ideas. She also worked in duchesse satin, gathered at the neckline to emphasize breasts, Monroe-esque silk sunray pleats, and ’30s showgirl lingerie playsuits. Great oversized rubberized raincoats with inside-out seams and a black satin jockey cardigan with knit sleeves also stood out from what was a vast inventory of must-have items.</p><p>Prada referenced many of her own past collections, from her bourgeois ladylike phase to her militaristic moments and her love of vintage lingerie. But her achievement was in making something inspiringly new out of confronting a personal taboo. “I was fed up with people saying I can’t do sexy clothes!” she stated backstage. It was said with a laugh, but the designer has done nothing less than change the fashion agenda overnight.</p></div>"
93,fall,2002,f2002,rafael-lopez,"Fur hasn't been seen on the London runway since the late Princess Margaret was a girl. But this season, it's a growing trend being pursued, unexpectedly, by some of the city's youngest designers. One of these is Rafael Lopez, a Spaniard who passed through Central Saint Martins College of Art and various jobs in Italy before returning to show his own collection here.</p><p>Lopez clearly has an appreciation for femininity and a Latin yearning for luxe: Witness his jacket made of strips of sage-colored mink, and coat of patchworked leather, suede and chinchilla. His collection looked best when he used dark-chocolate silk velvet in casual shapes—like bomber jackets or low-slung cropped pants that laced at the side of the leg—or black velvet for a slouchy sweatshirt and swishy full skirt. Other great show pieces were a sculptural suede bubble skirt and an oversized cardigan. Many of Lopez's evening dresses, pieced and patchworked in Art Deco patterns, were overly influenced by Balenciaga's ""Victorian"" collection—but that's far from a rare phenomenon this season. And while the fashion press waits impatiently for young designers to get over Ghesquière, it's allotting creative credits to those who show sparks of their own individuality. On that count—and boosted by the fact that his small Summer collection flew at retail—Lopez has officially joined the ""worth watching"" list.</p></div>"
94,fall,2002,f2002,ralph-lauren,"After his all-white Spring show, Ralph Lauren turned in a serious, elegant Fall collection that was almost entirely black. The high-ceilinged library of his Madison Avenue headquarters formed an appropriately scholarly backdrop for a show that embraced historical references—best seen in a lovely fitted, puff-sleeve Victorian top that stopped just above the waistline for a sexy glimpse of skin.</p><p>The designer kept silhouettes clean and close to the body, lending texture to his outfits by juxtaposing humble and high-scale, rough and supple: cotton cargo pants worn with a soft ruffled chiffon shirt and a supple velvet jacket, for example, or a cropped embroidered shearling jacket over a clinging velvet gown.</p><p>Jackets are making a concerted comeback, and Lauren offered a baker's dozen, each with its own attitude. Downtown hipsters will pick the cropped, fitted styles, or put the reworked chalk-stripe morning coat with a pair of jeans; uptown types will love the ladylike styles that hug the waist and flare slightly over the hips.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""i9buyi""></div></div><p>The biggest news was Lauren's new strength in eveningwear, which ranged from stay-at-home elegance—a beaded cashmere sweater and wool flannel pants—to the all-out glamour of embroidered silk gowns.

95,fall,2002,f2002,richard-edwards,"Designing duo Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick showed their first women's collection three seasons ago, having won praise and attention for their menswear line. Their haberdashery roots figured large for Fall, with classic silhouettes and simple fabrics contributing to the show's highlights. The low-slung trousers—those left devoid of tricky draping effects—as well as a few clingy black dresses and a lovely ivory wrap coat showed a talent for polished simplicity. But too many odd ideas, such as oversize cowl sweaters, rope halter dresses and pants with apron attachments, cluttered up their message.</p></div>"

Today he presented a Fall collection entitled ""Sparrow"" that showed the technical skill and romantic-goth vision that's won him a loyal—and burgeoning—fan base. ""We've carried him for the last five years, and our business just keeps growing,"" said Ed Burstell, vice president and general manager of Henri Bendel. ""It's a cult; women love the way he fits the body.""</p><p>The mood of Owens' presentation was somber—a dark, raw space and a sound track of Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop—but the clothes were gently sexy and even cozy. Not one for color (despite his indigenous climate), Owens worked in grays, chalky white, black and taupe. Long clinging dresses were paired with fuzzy ankle-length sweater coats, while soft, baggy corduroy pants looked great with the distressed leather jackets the designer is known for. Judging by a black corduroy tuxedo jacket, Owens can do traditional tailoring, but his real love is innovative draping.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""v3pvqo""></div></div><p>Owens pays as much attention to the back of a garment as its front, creating fishtail trains and clever details, like an unexpected hood made from a swell of fabric. Most outfits were topped by a monkish balaclava helmet, emphasizing the elongated, flowing silhouette and lending a cultish, otherworldly air to the proceedings.</p></div>"
97,fall,2002,f2002,roberto-cavalli,"In the world of Roberto Cavalli, nothing succeeds like excess. The highest heels! The super-est supermodels! More, more, more! The sight of Cindy Crawford and Eva Herzigova throwing curves in tight dresses, pencil-skirted suits and knock-your-eye-out prints brings back the good old eighties Italian-style.</p><p>Cavalli's ideal woman is a rock-star's wife, and it's no coincidence that his growing cult following is music business people and good-time girls everywhere who dream of a piece of the arm-candy action. Each show is like the next installment in a so-bad-it's-good soap opera, and this fall we see our heroine in possession of the keys to her first French chateau. Now she's a lady and her idea of dressing the part means slipping into a scarf-print dress or a trompe l'oeil satin blouse with a few fabulous estate jewels printed on the front. For polite cocktails, her little black dress is seamed to outline her very personal assets. Inspired by the neat old brocades in her new home, she's had some cool jeans and jackets made in the same fabric. And for those post-gig parties, she'll knock the competition dead in a brown patent leather vixen suit or maybe that white fur floor-trailing parka with the snakeskin pants. Whatever, the girl's arrived.</p></div>"
98,fall,2002,f2002,roland-mouret,"The excitement in watching Roland Mouret is the way he walks a fine line between French romanticism and the London gutter. As a Frenchman, he's obsessed with making beautiful fabrics run over a woman's body like a whispered compliment; as a guy who lives in London, he knows a Gallic cliché when he sees one.</p><p>Mouret's clothes are for women who can't stand overdressing at night, but still want to turn on the seduction. Which they can do perfectly in a chiffon dress with billowing sleeves, or a dramatically simple neck-to-floor column of black jersey that turns to show a naked back. Newer for Mouret this season is his addition of structured tailoring, like belted jackets with strong shoulders, bouclé pants and a navy trenchcoat with overstitched seaming, all with a faintly '40s air. Even more impressive is the changing backdrop against which Mouret's clothes are shown. What was once an off-schedule date in gritty Bermondsey is now an affair amongst gleaming chandeliers in Christie's. Flattery will get you everywhere.</p></div>"
99,fall,2002,f2002,ruffo-research,"Ruffo Research is a kind of nursery project for new fashion talent. Each year, an independent design company is selected to do two guest collections, enjoying the benefits of Ruffo’s extraordinary expertise in producing leather. This fall is the second and final season for Alexandre Matthieu, the French partnership of Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau.</p><p>The design duo’s signature is a young Parisian version of feminine street-chic, a vision they expressed via seamed corset tops and dresses shown over sweatshirts, and coats and pants decorated with geometric-patterned overstitching. The opportunity to experiment with Ruffo’s leather techniques produced distressed chestnut leather jackets, a long cable-stitch cardigan knitted from leather yarn, and what looked like white-painted crackled surfaces on bombers decorated with sliced fringing. The standouts were the gold leather biker coat and satchels, one of which was also gold, reminiscent of army surplus bags.</p><p>Alexandre Matthieu’s relatively quiet shows came after a succession of edgier Ruffo guest designers: Véronique Branquinho, Raf Simons, A.F. Vandevorst and Sophia Kokosalaki. Speculation on who’s been headhunted for 2003 will be settled by a formal announcement in April.</p></div>"
100,fall,2002,f2002,russell-sage,"When Russell Sage put a heap of gleaming coins center-stage at his show as payback to his mortgage-lender sponsors, Britannic Money, the audience had an opportunity to contemplate the deeper symbolism: Can UK fashion stay solvent?</p><p>If money was in the spotlight, though, talent—and lots of it—was also on display. As his first model appeared in a waisted, full-skirted dress made from eighteenth-century golden silk curtain fabric, complete with tassels fringing the hemline, Sage instantly proved the value of British designers' gloom-busting resourcefulness. He followed up with equally spirit-lifting, richly romantic one-of-a-kind pieces fashioned, Scarlett O'Hara-wise, from antique drapes. Sage's silhouettes might be vaguely outlined on 1950s couture volumes, but his crafting of materials, raw edges, arty embroideries and jigsaw-puzzle piecing are strictly 2002. And after mastering the new feeling for gilded fabric, he effortlessly nailed another major trend: brilliant chunky knits. Working with Bidyut Das, a knitwear graduate from the Royal College of Art, Sage sent out a spectacular high-waisted gray wool dress, knitted in graduated stitch to fall to the floor in sculptural waves. Wound along one arm was a huge spiral glass armlet with a $25,000 diamond embedded in it.</p><p>Cash-poor but imagination-rich, London designers like Sage still have the optimism (not to mention sponsors like the Diamond Information Centre and Swarovski) to help them face the challenge of staying afloat. ""It's really tough,"" he says. ""But I don't think I could show anywhere else. And remember: McQueen and Chalayan came out of London's last downtime.""</p></div>"
101,fall,2002,f2002,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford is very, very good at being wicked. The designer was in an adult-erotic frame of mind at Yves Saint Laurent, taking potential clichés such as black satin ribbon, taffeta, velvet, chantilly lace and fur and applying them in an offhand way to extravagant, body-emphasizing pieces that often looked as if they might fall off at the slightest pull of a bow. What, after all, could be more provocative than a woman wearing expensive clothes that look as if they were made to be undone by a lover?</p><p>The silhouette was an elaboration of the one he’d set at Gucci: a generous top and the tightest, rumpled, to-the-knee skirt, skinny pants, or the season’s first genuinely chic knickers done in black velvet. This time he worked the volume into blouses and jackets with dropped shoulders and billowing eighteenth-century sleeves—a device he used most gorgeously in a dark blue velvet coat with huge puffs, lace and mink embellishing the cuff. The show was full of amazingly detailed, sexily cut suits, fabulous coats and sweeping evening gowns delicately inserted with lace.</p><p>Ford did many riveting things with ribbons and bows. They recurred holding together the seams of a skirt, in a quilting pattern on a suede biker jacket, or as whole skirt made of strips of Chantilly lace. Best of all was a midnight blue velvet suit with a jacket slashed in the back, closed with a row of bows in black satin. It just may have been the most provocative look of the entire season.</p></div>"
102,fall,2002,f2002,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel's muse is a sexy businesswoman who knows full well that the guys are checking out her legs, but blithely seals the deal anyway. Of course, that's also Rykiel herself—a working woman who doesn't think sex appeal should be left in the bedroom.</p><p>Her Fall 2002 collection, with its fluttering bows, narrow black pants and pencil skirts, fluffy fur vests and minis, and sheer knits hit on most of fall's major trends. But Rykiel has been there, done that well before most of the designers who took a bow this week, and she knows how to make the season over in her image. For starters, there's her notoriously skinny cut, shown to advantage in numerous clingy knit tops and dresses, and her typical touch of Forties retro in the coats. And in this season of the knit, those horizontal stripes and ballerina necklines couldn't be anybody but Sonia.</p><p>Things did occasionally stray off course—especially some droopy tweeds, an interlude of acid green and a surfeit of kimono-sleeved fur coats. But when Rykiel closed the show with an eye-popping gang of models, all in brightly colored off-the-shoulder sweaters and droopy-brimmed hippie hats, it was clear that she still knows how to work a room.</p></div>"
103,fall,2002,f2002,sophia-kokosalaki,"The mob scene at the door of Sophia Kokosalaki’s Fall show was reminiscent of Alexander McQueen’s last days in London. And this time, the crowd included McQueen himself, struggling through heavies and St. Martin’s student gatecrashers to watch the greatest remaining hope of this city go through her paces.</p><p>It was certainly the most polished collection London has produced this season, even though Kokosalaki reverted from the gentleness of her Summer show back into the darker sources of her imagination. To the hard-driving, neo-industrial beats of Kraftwerk and Joy Division, she showed a collection based on black, with an intense concentration on the kind of lashed-together collage cutting seen at Balenciaga, Helmut Lang and Hussein Chalayan. Kokosalaki said she had been thinking about “typography and texture—and, without being religious, about the symbolism of crosses and runes.” Which translated into jackets and tops cut away to resemble jigsaw puzzles of fabric, then strung together with spider-web threads across the torso. The skill Kokosalaki refined during her stint at Ruffo Research, meanwhile, was amply evident in her highly desirable signature leather bombers, decorated this season with curlicued embroidery inserts. And her Greek heritage was referenced in pants that were tucked, Cretan peasant–style, into flat, black knee boots. This designer knows where she's coming from. The question is, where is she headed next?</p></div>"
104,fall,2002,f2002,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney has built a reputation on her ability to gauge what women of her generation want to wear. In her second collection under her own name, McCartney, now 30, did an about-face from her jokey, nightclubby presentation for Spring, and set off in a newly sophisticated direction.</p><p>The designer sent out gentler layerings of the turn-on pieces she's become known for starting, with satiny, slightly padded parkas featuring raw edges and a tracery of the naïve hand-stitched embroidery she's used before. The cool factor was there, but McCartney also unified the whole collection with a subtle color statement—soft, elusive tints of oyster, ivory, plaster pink, washed-out grays and mossy faded greens. Her super-narrow gray-ish jeans zipped at the ankle and combined with high-heeled, two-tone pumps with round toes provided the base on which she layered georgette dresses and some great tops. Chunky cable knits and a fashion-freak version of the classic U.S. Air Force aviator jacket looked strong, but not too street. McCartney's takes on tuxedos, high-waisted double-face cashmere coats and long chiffon gowns rounded out a collection in which she drew a line in the sand about who she is, who she's addressing, and where she's going next. The girl has grown up.</p></div>"
105,fall,2002,f2002,strenesse,"The artsy, retro wave that swept over many of Milan's collections this week—ethnic influences, girlish silhouettes and asymmetrical hemlines—seems to have crested with the Strenesse collection. Strenesse designer Gabriele Strehle has always injected a little downtown gallery-owner attitude into her commercially appealing sportswear; but this season it looks like she bought a loft in SoHo, c. 1985, and has Laurie Anderson coming over for dinner.</p><p>Strehle showed a mostly black collection heavy with Japanese references such as kimono sleeves, torso-wrapping obi belts, and the rosy-toned print that leavened the monochrome palette, showing up in loose blouses and fluid, knee-length dresses. While there were good-looking pieces with appeal to any serious fashion follower—a generously cut black trench and some gleaming, feminine black satin dresses—Strehle stuck too close to a bygone—albeit important—fashion era.</p></div>"
106,fall,2002,f2002,valentino,"With a bounce of their blow-dried, lacquered hairdos, a crowd of blonde bella donnas stepped out on the runway, decked head-to-gold-booted-toe in Valentino's vision of uptown chic. The designers' classic themes were out in force in a collection that played on his reputation for ultra-feminine tailoring, and paid homage to his rich archive of eveningwear.</p><p>For day, Valentino's coats, prettily cinched at the waist and full in the skirt, were trimmed with deep bands of fur. He showed city-proper tweed and camel and added excitement to suits with long, fluid pleated skirts by slitting them to show a flash of leg. He even nodded to the biker trend of the season by cutting the most curvaceous leather jackets in town. But Valentino's woman is no streetwise toughie. She prefers to shine at all times, which is why her accessories—boots, bags, gloves and metallic leaf-shaped belts—came in gold, gold and more gold. For dinner, she loves a black lace blouse with poetic sleeves, a cute tiered taffeta smock and a lovely high-waisted coat, fastened under the bust with a black satin bow. She's even happier when given license to go all out for grand evening events. Valentino is at hand to offer every glam option in the book, from floor length gold-sequined gowns, through stately black taffeta, right up to the eye-popping classic red dresses that closed his show in the time-honored fashion.</p></div>"
107,fall,2002,f2002,vera-wang,"Vera Wang became a household name putting women into white dresses. But as her all-black fall 2002 collection made clear, she has a sophisticated dark side, too.</p><p>Wang's strength has always been in evening wear, and her fall collection was a kind of historical survey of luxurious glamour. There were Victorian touches, including handwork-intensive details like pintucking and beading, high-necked furry capelets, and corset references. The Thirties were referenced via bias-cut silk charmeuse or an occasional flurry of ostrich feather decoration. A fitted, quilted top that Wang called a ""fencing jacket"" paired with a matching mini looked distinctly 60s-era Mod, and one knee-grazing dress sported a shades-of-the-Eighties pouf. There were also plenty of skin-baring separates like a chiffon halter over lacy boot-cut trousers, which were thoroughly up-to-the-minute.</p><p>Wang has been on a roll this year, publishing a book about weddings as well as launching her first fragrance in a bid to expand her business. But this collection makes it clear that she's still got a firm grip on her first priority: beautiful clothes for gala-filled lives.</p></div>"
108,fall,2002,f2002,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho has a remarkable talent for treading lightly through the season's important trends while never showing a single piece that could be called ""trendy."" Take lamé or collage and contrast fabrics or trompe l'oeil dresses. Or then again, take knit-art, velvet, satin, military, men's wear influences, and all those indescribable nuances of pale, dusted-to-nothing tones of pink, misty grays, oyster and fawn. Branquinho has it all, and still emerges looking like no one but herself.</p><p>The gold lamé came muted and antiqued—and excused of all vulgarity—in a long sleeved peasant dress with a square bib of brocade. The knits included jacquard turtlenecks, patterned like Victorian wallpaper and fluted dresses with full, striped skirts. Branquinho showed khaki bombers sometimes with her signature gathered yoke, and new versions of the coats with the tiny puff in the shoulder line she originated in the late '90s.</p><p>Branquinho's approach encompasses both a non-wimpy sense of poetry and real wearability. She cuts a flattering mannish pant, a fabulous tailored velvet jacket and has the kind of stacked narrow-heeled boots that will make absolutely everything in a woman's wardrobe work for fall. She's also got the skill to experiment on classic and even frumpy ideas, tipping them into avant-garde territory. Her versions of Chanel tweed suits, cut narrow and with the edges left frayed, are certain to wield star influence next season.</p></div>"
109,fall,2002,f2002,versace,"The video walls exploded in a kaleidoscope of color, and Amber Valletta, grown-up and gorgeous, strode onto the runway in a swinging psychedelic print cashmere coat shrugged over a white turtleneck and pants. It was the opening shot in a collection in which Donatella Versace proved herself in supreme control of a powerful new classiness.</p><p>Color and sexiness are to be expected—even demanded—at Versace. But the surprise was how Donatella delivered on that while showcasing outstanding, couture-standard clothes with a five-star wearability rating. ""I wanted to do quality and tradition—but with fun,"" said the designer. Versace coats are some of the most gorgeous of the season, impeccably cut and with embroidery, quilting or edgings and inserts of leather expertly deployed to emphasize shape. There was casually luxurious fur, sheared inside and out to look like corduroy. Some of the best looks were the collection's most spare: a neon yellow cashmere tank with black flares and a huge black bag, a candy pink double-face coat paired with a tank and lilac pants, even a restrained, oversized black coat, its buttonholes edged in satin, thrown over a plain black pantsuit. There were great bright micro-flower print dresses and the obligatory slit-up-to-there red-carpet evening gowns. But Donatella's knockout punch was putting glamour, color, excitement—and, believe it or not, simplicity—into an adult woman's day.</p></div>"
110,fall,2002,f2002,versus-versace,"Unlike the '70s and '80s references that have populated the runways lately, Donatella Versace referenced a more recent decade for Versus in a brightly colored upbeat collection inspired by the '90s and acid house culture. That might seem a bit off the mark even in today's accelerated retro cycle, but never mind. It worked just fine.</p><p>Carmen Kass kick-started the show in a sky-blue rabbit fur coat and skintight jeans that stretched down over the shoes. Those jeans, some ruched down the outside seam, others splashed in purple, orange and blue came in cotton velvet and washed cord and showcased Donatella's savvy about what girls really want to wear. She used a hoodie sweatshirt as one of the core pieces layering in cut-off, raw-edged skirts over pants and adding in T-shirts, bomber jackets and fur.</p><p>And when mad clashing flower prints on T-shirts got thrown into the mix alongside baby-blue shaggy shearlings and jeans appliquéd with frayed patches spelling out the word VERSUS, Donatella brought in an optimism and energy that's very welcome right now, no matter what the decade. For evening, the dress code recalled another recognizable zone of Versace's celebratory universe. The black leather corset dresses inset with lace looked like a reworking of Gianni Versace's legendary sex-bomb designs from the heydays of the '90s.</p></div>"
111,fall,2002,f2002,viktor-rolf,"Viktor &amp; Rolf enigmatically named their collection ""long live the immaterial."" It was hard to decipher precisely what that meant since the collection was full of rather heavy materials—wool, pinstripes, fur, velvet, crochet. The designers' talent for earnest experimentalism with traditional elements was funneled into a single device this season; they highlighted all-black outfits with bits of vivid royal blue so that the epaulettes, collars, bib shirt fronts and belts popped out in radiant color.</p><p>The designers showed a bit of their playful side with jackets ornamented by absurdly-inflated cargo pockets. But otherwise, the collection had an almost disturbing degree of bourgeois propriety about it. Harlequin patterns of the sort normally seen on golf sweaters were blown up for patchwork fur and wool skirts and big mufflers. Paisley showed up on soft brown wool pants suits, and then in a stately blue velvet gown topped by an enormous coat with matching paisley lining.</p><p>Perhaps the show's title referred more to the backdrop—aerial photos of the Manhattan skyline at night, Texas oil fields, cotton fields, and traffic. For a charming, if unfathomable finale, the designers appeared in matching blue pajama suits while their disembodied heads floated among stars on the screens.</p></div>"
112,fall,2002,f2002,warren-noronha,"Sexy pinstripes may sound like a contradiction in terms, but that's Warren Noronha's contribution to the new interest in tailoring that is taking off in London. In a slick show on a mirrored runway, Noronha struck a blow for the much neglected pantsuit, recutting it without any of the uptight corporate connotations it’s attracted over the past decade.</p><p>Erin O'Connor set the tone when she strode out wearing a pinstripe bustier with a foulard flounce at the front and matching pants—not exactly career dressing, but drop-dead elegant from head to toe. Other versions had jackets, again with bias cutting falling in subtle folds in front. Noronha said he'd persuaded Savile Row tailors to get him the best menswear material to work with. ""I'm trying to make old things fashionable,"" he said. ""You can do anything if you cut it outrageously enough."" Noronha, an ex-assistant of Antonio Berardi, also believes in dresses. For this show, some were also done in pieced pinstripes, with corseted midsections, others in silk draped to fall in dippy asymmetrical hemlines. A kimono theme featuring ultrawide sleeves slightly overwhelmed some pieces but, in all, this was a collection that showed conviction and growing accomplishment.</p></div>"
113,fall,2002,f2002,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto's riffs on sport-meets-couture-meets-Japanese-asymmetry have lasted a couple of seasons now. But even though other designers have been coming up on the outside with zippy track suits, hoodies and parkas this season, Yohji is still out in front.</p><p>As is his wont, Yamamoto mixed street sport pieces with military drab, denim, knit, biker leathers and traditional suit and coat fabrics. He started out with trompe l'oeil biker jackets which were fused with skirts to look like coats, then cut up denim to layer over zipped sweats and long, elegant black pleated skirts. Oversized men's suits stumbled on the asexual side, but the designer's 20-year obsession with the formal structures of Western couture put him back on track. He cut tailcoats in khaki and worked graphic leather patches into black jackets and suits. A navy melton peacoat and a long coat cut with three-quarter-length puffed sleeves bordered on modernist Balenciaga.</p><p>Ultimately, this show was a bit of a marathon complete with some uphill moments. And when Yamamoto reached the finish line via parkas and nylon jackets with wings painted on the back, it wasn't certain whether he was conjuring heavenly seraphims or Hell's Angels. Either way, the audience cheered.</p></div>"
114,fall,2002,f2002,zac-posen,"How hot a ticket was Zac Posen's first independent show? Hot enough to get major models to walk the runway, Manolo Blahnik to do the shoes and first daughter Barbara Bush to sit in the front row. Even more impressively, the 21-year-old New Yorker lived up to the hype, delivering a strong, if not terribly commercial, message.</p><p>But then Posen is not aiming to be the next Ralph Lauren. His inspiration is '30s fashion—the sort of outfits Jean Harlow might have sported at a cocktail party. Pushing that notion of glamour to the extreme, Posen built his collection around dresses, mostly bias-cut with provocative necklines, which declared a fierce devotion to the female form. The designer incorporated '30s design elements like contrasting insets, fitted bodices, fluttering ruffles and fishtail trains, and used movie-star fabrics like satin and crepe, but also worked with cotton, leather and mesh. (While many of the looks were entrance-makers, there were also some quietly wearable pieces, like a blush mesh top and a long, mitred tweed coat.) And in a week of muted, monochrome palettes, Posen's 32 looks were a riot of color: orange, purple, blue and yellow, along with the occasional black and white.</p><p>The models, including Karen Elson, Eleonora Bose, Liberty Ross, Teresa Lourenco and the actress Paz de la Huerta, were clearly given a mandate to act up, and they did, vamping for the cameras like seasoned starlets.</p></div>"
1,spring,2003,s2003,a-f-vandevorst,"In the deconstructive ’90s, <em>glamour</em> was a dirty word. But now there is a real thrill to be had in watching a rising generation reclaim the term as their own. Few are doing it better than the Belgian husband-and-wife team An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, who sent out a stellar collection that took ’50s-flavored dressiness into exciting new territory.</p><p>A series of raincoats, in a range of colors from silver-and-white brocade to vivid red, shown with great cropped narrow pants and strappy silver heels, signaled A.F. Vandevorst’s intent to make grown-up clothes cool again. That goal only became more appealing as the couple displayed a sequence of knee-length dresses, some with sunburst-pleat skirts, others flowing toga-style over one shoulder. The elegance was in the deceptive simplicity; setting aside theoretical tendencies, they cut to the chase with something as easy as a silver Lurex tank worn over a white T-shirt dress and cinched with a chrome dragon belt.</p><p>After superb combinations of white with ecru chiffon in sheer blouses and aprons, the pair came up with a pink silk floral fabric—something between a ’50s evening brocade and an Indian sari—which they wrapped into bustiers and cut as a perfectly beautiful dress with twisted straps and a small flounce rippling to the hem. Now it's official: glamour is the new edge.</p></div>"
2,spring,2003,s2003,alberta-ferretti,"Snip! Snip! Snip! Scissors have been working overtime in Milan this season, and miles of redundant skirt fabric have hit the cutting-room floor. Even the perpetual romantic Alberta Ferretti caught the fever for shortening everything up to here.</p><p>She started with little shift dresses that had a distinct ’60s flavor, in colors like olive, buff, pale blue and silver, some woven through with strips of chiffon made to look like raffia. She then showed a group of tiny chiffon, ruched and puckered formfitting pieces, which were part ’50s swimsuit, part dress. Some of them came with minute flips of frill at the hem or with a matching pair of micro shorts—great clubwear for the cellulite-free under-25s. Ferretti thought of her more mature bohemian customers as well, though, sending out sheer embroidered skirts to wear over the body dresses for a modicum of modesty.</p></div>"
3,spring,2003,s2003,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell’Acqua plucks the trends from the Milanese air, musses them up and makes them appealing to a girl who likes her clothes on the skimpy side. His spring collection blended Italy’s current obsessions—utility clothing, satins and chiffons, chinoiserie, and a range of muted colors—with his personal affinity for lingerie touches.</p><p>The season's combat element showed up in a loose bottom garment that looked like a cross between jodhpurs and Zouave pants, tied somehow with drawstrings just below the knee. Dell’Acqua topped the style with chiffony flyaway pieces (including a sheer deconstructed cheongsam blouse) that blow open at every opportunity, showing plenty of flesh. Better ideas—for those of perfect leg, anyway—were vintagey lace-edged rose satin underwear converted into cute shorts and a coolly casual sage-green belted bush jacket with short shorts. When the same themes were sent out in somber black, however, it only served to underscore how the eye craves something prettier for summer.</p></div>"
4,spring,2003,s2003,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen, showman, bad boy, where are you now? After joining Gucci Group and losing 30 pounds, the designer has shed his famously macabre show tactics. The most shocking things about his summer presentation were its stripped-down, old-fashioned romance and solid commercial appeal.</p><p>Against a giant screen projection of underwater scenes and <em>Blair Witch</em>–style haunted woods, McQueen unfolded a sartorial narrative that began with pirates and drowned maidens and ended in the rainforest. The odd journey took in brown leather corset vests and minis, worn with creamy chiffon ruffles, drapey knicker-length shorts, and Elizabethan doublets and ruffs. After a diversion into a largely redundant black sequence, McQueen burst out with prints and colors, and some major showstoppers in the form of floaty dresses in vibrant tie-dyes and jumpsuits in lime and electric blue. His crescendo was a rainbow-colored floor-sweeping gown with tulle ruffles and some spectacular boleros made of what looked like bird-of-paradise feathers.</p></div>"
5,spring,2003,s2003,alexandre-herchcovitch,"A sort of Brazilian Karl Lagerfeld, Alexandre Herchcovitch is a fashion superstar in his country of origin, where the prolific designer produces no fewer than four collections per season—his own signature label (which he also now shows in Paris), two jeanswear lines and a collection for the CORI company.</p><p>Herchcovitch is a consummate showman, and his presentations sometimes compete with the clothes for attention. For Spring, however, he was right on target, projecting colorful bull's-eyes onto the floor, which he intended to evoke ""the little waves produced when you drop a stone into a lake."" The designer's typically colorful collection incorporated a range of current trends, from ruffles and layering through beach and surf references (tie-dyes and bikinis). By far the most effective element, though, was Herchcovitch's take on active sportswear—especially his colorful athletic jackets and a lovely red drop-waisted dress of georgette silk with racing stripes. (The stripes, made of rainbow zippers developed exclusively for the designer by YKK, appeared throughout the show.)</p><p>Herchcovitch's easy command of color and cultures, and his irrepressible energy, are sure signs that his little waves will eventually break on far larger shores.</p></div>"
6,spring,2003,s2003,alice-roi,"As much as she’s a groovy downtown hipster, Alice Roi is entranced by the Watergate-era wasp wardrobe, with its proper proportions, clean lines and sporty allusions—somewhere between Tippi Hedren in <em>The Birds</em> and Sigourney Weaver in <em>The Ice Storm</em>.</p><p>Roi’s spring collection succeeded in bringing that demure esthetic firmly up to date. Her well-edited show included some brisk dresses and suits in low-key colors—grey, white, houndstooth check—cut from stiff fabrics that stood away from the body (a refreshing change in a week when most garments couldn’t get close enough to the female form). She showed sweetly sexy crocheted cardigans and dresses and some cozy, oversize velour hoodies. And after a rather abrupt group of shiny green and silver spandex bodysuits (scuba lessons at the country club, anyone?), the designer’s sexy little black cocktail dresses closed the evening on a high note.</p></div>"
7,spring,2003,s2003,ann-demeulemeester,"The most compelling designers working now are those who do so out of genuine personal conviction, and Ann Demeulemeester is certainly one of them. She has stayed true to her punk-out Patti Smith vision for 15 years, gathering many faithful followers along the way.</p><p>To fashion insiders, however, Demeulemeester's onward march seemed samey and relentless this season. Apart from some great silver leathers, the collection showed little awareness of mainstream trends—or even the idea of summer itself, which doesn't exactly cry out for black washed-leather biker coats and pants. Rebel-hearted fans, of course, won't have cared about that, preferring to zoom in on the messages on her T-shirts, which spelled out encouraging words like <em>life, sin</em> and <em>wilder.</em> And her fans should have been more than happy with the new Demeulemeester accessory, a dangling wraparound leather neck piece, which looked thrillingly like barbed wire.</p></div>"
8,spring,2003,s2003,anna-sui,"Whatever the current trends, count on Anna Sui to find the appropriate soundtrack. This season, it was the Ramones from beginning to end, providing a high-energy backdrop for her punchy spring collection.</p><p>Sui started out with kicky plaid pleated minis; hip-length, boxy, tight trousers trimmed in bright ribbon; and Carnaby Street-inspired striped shirts. She quickly moved out of the dance club and into the country club with a series of dresses, skirts, tops and jackets inspired by organized sports: piqué golf skirts embroidered with frogs, short white tennis dresses that mixed athletic mesh and lace, football jerseys shrunk for a more feminine fit, cropped baseball jackets, prepped-out sweaters and fuzzy cardigans. From there, she went fragile (though <em>Blitzkrieg Bop</em> continued to pound out of the speakers), closing the show with a series of lacy, neon-bright baby-doll dresses worn with clunky Frye boots. There were some cute, compelling pieces mixed into the outfits, like a ruffled floral windbreaker and some short silk floral dresses. But Sui's ability to translate street trends into great items was not as much in evidence as it has been in past seasons.</p></div>"
9,spring,2003,s2003,anne-klein,"Anne Klein designer Charles Nolan faces a tricky fashion dilemma: how to take a venerable, commercially powerful name and give it a new lease on life, without alienating a faithful clientele.</p><p>For spring, Nolan rose to the challenge by adding a touch of tough chic to the sportswear classics for which the label is known. Skintight trousers were paired with generous deerskin motorcycle jackets, while pencil skirts and short shorts came with neat cotton blouses or soft jersey tops. He kept the fabrics lightweight—parachute silk, crisp cotton, seersucker, taffeta—and the color palette predominantly white, khaki, toffee, gray and black, with shots of red and pink. The handkerchief-point hem has embedded itself deeply into spring's collections, and Nolan showed his own version, using striped fabrics in bias-cut skirts that just grazed the knee.</p><p>Sportswear is all about easy comfort, and, as far as Nolan is concerned, that notion extends to evening as well: He sent out tiny jersey dresses paved with coin-size paillettes and rhinestone-studded sweatshirts that were simultaneously soft and sparkly.</p></div>"
10,spring,2003,s2003,antonio-berardi,"Shrinking violets, seek your spring wardrobe elsewhere. The last thing Antonio Berardi's brazen young things want to do is melt into the background. With their wild tresses flowing and their skirts climbing ever skyward, these girls make tossing propriety to the wind an Olympic sport.</p><p>But it's all in good fun. Berardi designed his spring line in spun-sugar colors: lavender, pale yellow, sky blue and apricot, tempered with some ivory, white and black to keep the insulin levels in check. Using attention-grabbing fabrics like gleaming charmeuse and breezy gossamer silks, he cut skintight dresses, short-short skirts and pants tight enough for a rock star. Those trends have gotten plenty of airtime in the spring collections, though, and Berardi didn't bring much news to the table. Where he really shows his hand is with jackets: He cinches in the waists, blows out the shoulders to Thierry Mugler-esque proportions and piles on embellishments like beading or bits of lace. Berardi may not be the go-to guy for the working women of the world, but he'll always have the It girls.</p></div>"
11,spring,2003,s2003,badgley-mischka,"If the soundtrack of a show is any insight into a designer's state of mind, Badgley Mischka are feeling reflective. The duo, who've made their name by putting a modern spin on traditional glamour, opened their spring collection with Patti Smith's <em>Dancing Barefoot</em>, a beautiful but pensive ballad about letting go.</p><p>That mood translated into a toning down of Badgley Mischka's pile-it-on beads and baubles approach, making way instead for pastels, muted paisley prints, trailing handkerchief hems, whisper-light chiffons and lots of lace. There was also a new edge to the collection, by way of some short, flirty dresses and sexy blouses paired with skinny white pants. The models, with their mussed hair and mod clear-Lucite heels, looked softer and more approachable than last season's sirens.</p><p>That's not to say Badgley Mischka are stepping away from the sparkle and sex appeal that have made them famous—especially with another red carpet looming this Sunday at the Emmys. There were clingy, curvy, photo-op dresses aplenty (a good thing, with <em>Sex and the City</em>'s Kristin Davis in the front row). But with this collection, the designers definitely steered a new course by shedding some unnecessary glitz. And that's never a bad thing to let go of.</p></div>"
12,spring,2003,s2003,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière’s distillation of sport influences put Balenciaga far out in front of everyone else. Instead of scoring easy points by throwing in the inevitable track pant or tank, the designer used technical wizardry and intense research to transform surfing, diving and baseball references into streamlined city dressing.</p><p>Everything in his spring collection was body defining—cut short, sculpted to the torso and calculated to outline every curve—without losing sight of what the Balenciaga brand is all about: fantastic pants and jackets and distinctive decoration. Tiny dresses, seamed like scuba suits, had patched-in zones of bright Hawaiian surfer prints on the front or shoulder—a slick advance in Ghesquière’s exploration of collaged fabric. Other dresses were bound about with drapery that was stitched flat to the body. The crucial Balenciaga pant, which Ghesquière cut with a high waist for the past season, was this time done in stretch fabrics, shaped with complex seaming.</p><p>The standout look, certain to send copy artists into overdrive, was worn by Gisele Bündchen; the striped T-shirt with padded shoulders and ribbed skintight pants was about as un-literal a reference to baseball as you can imagine. When it comes to absorbing and recasting influences, Ghesquière is fashion’s champion left fielder, and that’s what puts him in a different league.</p></div>"
13,spring,2003,s2003,bcbg-max-azria,"BCBG Max Azria is based in Los Angeles, the city of eternal sunshine. And with his pretty, feminine spring collection, it seems the designer was doing his best to translate those blue skies and golden rays into clothing.</p><p>Fall's gloomy Goth looks have been banished in favor of Easter egg colors, skimpy dresses, A-line skirts and lingerie details, done in clingy lightweight fabrics like chiffon and silk jersey. Azria's silhouette follows the female form without stalking it, and he plays up the flirty aspects of his clothes by adding lacy trim; making deeply plunging necklines; and cutting dresses with layers of ruffly chiffon that swirl out at the knee.</p><p>There were a few smartly cut sportswear pieces, like a sharp chalk-white trench coat and a taupe pantsuit, to round out the collection. And, for those rare occasions when it gets chilly, Azria's short gold leather jacket will provide a little nighttime shine.</p></div>"
14,spring,2003,s2003,behnaz-sarafpour,"After her fall show, with its simple materials, pared-down shapes and erudite poetic references, Behnaz Sarafpour could easily have been labeled an egghead designer. But her expanded spring collection showed she's not looking to spend her Saturday nights in the library.</p><p>Yes, Sarafpour has an intellectual bent, demonstrated this time by a group of distinctly Japanese, crisp black-and-white wool minidresses that wrapped and tied intriguingly. But she also demonstrated a playful side, via canvas jeans, dresses and miniskirts hand-painted with chromatic bursts of color, and gold chain-link vests worn over washed silk separates (shades of Paco Rabanne). A couple of smartly cut canvas pieces with generous patch pockets traced their American sportswear heritage directly back to Bonnie Cashin.</p><p>She may not be a bookworm, but Sarafpour has clearly taken one famous motto to heart. With a mere 25 looks, her finely edited show left the smiling audience convinced that brevity is indeed the soul of wit.</p></div>"
15,spring,2003,s2003,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson's spring 2003 collection was titled ""My Blue Heaven,"" but it could just as well have been called ""Infectious Enthusiasm."" For Johnson, festive dressing is an everyday affair, and <em>joie de vivre</em> a driving principle.</p><p>This season, though, there were a few changes in the routine: Johnson showed the collection on August 10 at her East Hampton home, as the centerpiece of a daylong party that also celebrated her 60th birthday and her company's 24th year in business. The poolside show featured some reworkings of her greatest hits: tight jersey dresses printed with big, cheerful cabbage roses, corset tops and candy-colored lacy tulle petticoats, as well as a few punkette slashed pieces for the bad girls. Everything was tight, sheer or micro-short—the bathing suits could have embarrassed a Brazilian—but under Johnson's guidance, good cheer overwhelmed any whiff of potential sluttiness.</p><p>Johnson claims she's hit a milestone in her life and that now is the time to step back and let daughter Lulu take over much of the daily business. Whether that really happens remains to be seen, but one thing is inevitable: Wherever she ends up, Johnson will be spreading the love.</p></div>"
16,spring,2003,s2003,bill-blass,"In his fourth season as creative head at the house of Bill Blass, Lars Nilsson has established a few of his favorite things. The Swedish-born, Paris-trained designer loves folklore-inspired patterns, handcrafted details and—in an industry that consistently returns to black—vivid color. Part of the challenge for him at Blass is to incorporate these elements into the label’s tradition of sparely elegant sportswear.</p><p>There were moments when Nilsson achieved just the right balance: a bold chevron sweater, a creamy silk taffeta shirtdress, a simple white shirt paired with an A-line skirt embroidered in heavy silver bars. He used whispery silk seersucker to make pretty blouses and a pouf-sleeve shirtdress that will look great rippling in the spring breezes. But some of the looks he sent out, like a hip-length navy pinstripe blazer with emphatic shoulders, or elephant-leg trousers, seemed out of step in a season where pants are cut lean and jackets are generally short and swingy.</p><p>There’s no question, though, that Nilsson knows how to delight the eye: He closed his show with a torrent of tropical-toned evening wear, from flamingo pink to hibiscus red, that's sure to have all his customers yearning for their summer vacations</p></div>"
17,spring,2003,s2003,blaak,"Blaak, the <em>nom de mode</em> of Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, is a label that has established its identity by creating accessible, on-trend streetwear. This season, following the prevailing currents, the designers have moved from peasant remixes to a sporty ’80s approach full of references to the first great London fashion boom, circa 1984, when Katharine Hamnett and Body Map ruled the runways with their combat and dancewear clothes.</p><p>The designers played the trend with a collection of white and neutral tones punched up with metallic and neon touches, all done in washed cotton, mesh, satin and leather. Add in a lot of layering—tank tops under bombers, skirts over pants—plus cutaway, casual shapes, and you get the general picture.</p><p>Blaak’s best pieces are the elastic-waist bombers and vests that curve in back, tracksuit style. And the perforated white leather with solid banding on the seams was a snappy offering for summer’s fashion workout.</p></div>"
18,spring,2003,s2003,boudicca,"Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Their Boudicca presentations are symbolic, troubling experiences, drawn from sources so deep inside their heads there ought to be a handbook with footnotes. But then again, who needs explanations? Even at the far reaches of the avant-garde, fashion isn’t—or shouldn’t be—that complicated.</p><p>Boudicca’s Spring spectacle left viewers groping for meaning once again. The stage was set with a black-painted skeleton, a stuffed black swan, bowls of black-painted apples and digital clocks that the models punched into action as they passed, in the same clothes, over and over again. It was surreal, painfully slow and much like being trapped in a looping dream—exactly the vibe the designers intended.</p><p>Did the clothes mitigate the torture-by-conceptualism? Almost. There were beautiful asymmetric jersey dresses as well as elegant one-sleeved taffeta gowns. A normal woman could wear these statuesque, graceful clothes without being an involuntary walking art manifesto. In the end, it’s as simple as that.</p></div>"
19,spring,2003,s2003,burberry-prorsum,"Thirty-year-old Christopher Bailey is the designer charged with inventing a convincing identity for Burberry Prorsum—and solving the riddle of how to make that legendary plaid cool again. Now in his third season, he’s finding his stride, contributing a young, casual British feel to the collection without losing sight of the need to appeal to a sophisticated international audience.</p><p>Bailey picked up on the military/sport theme that has surfaced on so many other runways for spring, but managed to make something quirkily different of it. He matched cashmere jog pants and knickers, as well as leather biker pants, with sporty jackets—some made in mesh—and showed a macintosh, the mainstay of the house, in dark-green canvas with exposed zippers—a neat compromise between quality and cool. Against this solid background came a few injections of personality, like ’60s-inspired checkerboard patterns on sweaters and a light version of a college scarf, shot through with a bright lamé stripe. The new Burberry check, meanwhile, came scaled up, in soft green, on a shrunken jacket that had been distressed to look like a favorite personal piece. It worked.</p></div>"
20,spring,2003,s2003,cacharel,"Under the direction of British design team Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro, Cacharel has become a cheerful playground of zippy, youthful ideas. While the line might not make the earth move for a serious fashionista, its rediscovered verve produces at least one respectable, commercially viable idea per season.</p><p>For pring, Clements and Ribeiro combined elements of Carnaby Street, the San Fernando Valley circa 1983, and sunny St. Tropez. They showed oversized jersey tops and dresses; short skirts and overalls with bold floral appliqués; shrunken polo shirts, sometimes with crisp, skinny pants; and tiny chiffon tops and dresses. Not so different from other collections this season, except that the duo gave those pieces a blast of energy with giddy patterns and bracing colors—big tomato-red stripes, dizzy polka dots, soft madras plaids and paisleys, and gentle cherry blossom prints. Though there was the potential for mayhem, the overall effect was of happy chatter rather than chaotic shouting. And in a season when the main message is straight-out seduction, Cacharel's teenage innocence felt like a fresh breeze.</p></div>"
21,spring,2003,s2003,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein’s collections can have a hypnotic effect. Avoiding bells and whistles, he sends out utterly simple clothes that, through cut, color and drape, lull the watchers—who this season included Sandra Bullock and Gwyneth Paltrow—into a willing state of desire.</p><p>The designer’s darkly monastic fall collection, with its military overtones, is a thing of the past. Using a palette of teal blue, ivory, taupe, shell pink, white and black, he sent out a spring line that was as gentle as a sea breeze on a summer day. Luxury fabrics—supple viscose, fluid silk charmeuse, crisp linen, buttery glove leather and sheer chiffon—took the tailoring into a new realm and emphasized Klein’s command of understated sex appeal. (This is a designer who can turn a humble basic like a tank top or a knit camisole into a seductive tool, just by placing the neckline precisely so it strokes the model’s collarbone.) A more overt sexiness was also in evidence, via bra tops and corsets paired with severe tailored trousers, skinny low-slung skirts and tight black jersey dresses. The sportswear front was equally well represented, with crisp shirts and shirtdresses, oversize leather jackets with quilted or channel-stitched collars, and a sweeping suede camel trench. Klein ended the show, like a good day at the beach, with a feast of sweets: pretty, pastel dresses detailed with sunbursts of pintucking or bands of ruching, and a generous serving of vanilla-colored silk jersey dresses replete with cascading ruffles.</p></div>"
22,spring,2003,s2003,carolina-herrera,"In a testament to Carolina Herrera’s finely tuned sense of balance, her spring show contained equal measures of youthful nerve and sophisticated maturity.</p><p>Though Herrera's clothes never scream ""trendy,"" she knows how to drop in an up-to-the-minute reference to keep things fresh. With workwear all the rage, she added subtle details like D-rings and tab pockets and showed a slim-cut safari jacket atop a fluttery paisley chiffon skirt. Charmeuse is turning up on a lot of runways; Herrera used it sparingly but to good effect in long, cool dresses of vivid green and aquatic blue. Her butter-soft pink leather suit, with its knee-length skirt and patch pockets piped in brown, was luxuriously proper without being hard-edged. Elsewhere, the designer added romantic volume to her curve-hugging jersey dresses with a classic poet's sleeve, cut on an angle. And she gave that standard voluminous ball skirt a frisky new attitude simply by sitting it on the model's hips and pairing it with a crisp, sheer organza top.</p></div>"
23,spring,2003,s2003,celine,"Runway collections do many things: showcase intellectual experiments, play out designers' obsessions, display ideas for photographs—sometimes even present clothes that women might wear. The last on the list is, curiously, the rarest sighting of all. But Michael Kors certainly hasn't forgotten it at Celine. He turned in a spring collection that could actually come under the heading of true ready-to-wear—in the way an average person might understand it.</p><p>Kors brought a splash of ethnic color and handwork from India, added a sprinkling of the '60s, a soupçon of military, and rooted it all in uncomplicated clothing. You want something to get about town in? You're—dare we mention it—going to work? And you're taking a holiday at some point? In his methodical American way, Kors checked off all the boxes for spring and summer, lending just enough trend to keep the clothes current.</p><p>It was a tricky feat, and he handled it by choosing a vibrant palette of hot pink and orange against white, green and spice colors. Indian-influenced materials brought in shine and luxury via silver-embroidered duchesse satin, made into coats, pencil skirts and skinny pants. He toned it down for citywear, using floppy crinkled cotton for light trenches and little jackets and studded suede for slim skirts. Kors went on a bit too long with the swim and psychedelic-print beach pieces, but the collection was a statement of commerciality so unusual as to seem almost…brave.</p></div>"
24,spring,2003,s2003,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan joined a band for the night. He stood next to a five-piece avant-garde combo called the Brood, picked up a red Fender and plucked away on a single chord during his show. The significance of it all was, as always, an unexplained Chalayan-esque puzzle. Did it have something to do with the fact that the clothes he put out were shorter, stretchier and more colorful than before? Not really. Though his layered jersey dresses came with complex cutouts and bottom-hugging miniskirts, the collection didn't rock 'n' roll.</p><p>For spring, the designer revisited his obsession with construction and deconstruction; the clothes were shredded and cut away to expose layers of fabric and outline zones of flesh. Ironically, though, Chalayan is at his best when he veers away from academic complexity and his design emerges as recognizable garments and trends. The pieces he executed in drapey black—the shirt with wide armholes paired with a wrapped-waist skirt and the halter vest over pants—were beautifully cut and ready to be worn anywhere. There were exquisite layers of diaphanous pleats in a beige dress and fluted tunic, and there were a few pieces in lingerie pink and dusty greens that related to current fashion. As to what it all ""meant""—that's a mystery likely to remain locked up in Chalayan's head.</p></div>"
25,spring,2003,s2003,chloe,"Chloé designer Phoebe Philo understands the first law of provocation: never act like you're trying too hard. For spring, she trod a long-legged, high-heeled path through a collection that turned on the sex appeal without resorting to trashiness.</p><p>Philo also knows how to undercut the polished taste of a French house, via a smart young woman's way of putting things together. She used conventionally proper materials like navy chiffon, pale suede, black satin and a Spanish-influenced print to make little dresses with a lot of impact. Some were decorated with silver bobbles, to shiver as the wearer walks, others prettily embellished with brass flowers. Instead of being tartily clinging and revealing, Philo's tops were fluted and flew open at the neckline in a subtly undone way. She handled the obligatory leg-show with cuffed shorts and with low-slung skirts in gauzy fabrics, while the signature Chloé swimwear came in dressed-up two-pieces, tied around the body with beaded strings and trailing flirty little scarves.</p><p>Feminine and coolly accessorized with matching bags, this was a collection cleverly calculated to make men want to tear the clothes off a girl—in the nicest possible way, of course.</p></div>"
26,spring,2003,s2003,christian-dior,"The method to John Galliano’s Dior madness is no longer in debate. The designer has re-branded the legendary Parisian house via high-octane couture shows that broach the wilder shores of creativity and are then filtered down to instantly recognizable ready-to-wear pieces for Christian Dior addicts.</p><p>Galliano’s spring show stayed true to his now well-established formula, as slinky cargo pants, fanny-hugging mini parachute dresses with voluminous tops, Hollywood-showgirl frocks and amped-up bikinis rolled effortlessly off the production line. He displayed accessible versions of the gargantuan leather jackets, strap-bound leather tubes and plunging goddess dresses that appeared in his July couture show, sending a current of new fluorescents, khakis and metallics down the runway.</p><p>There were some pulse-racing moments—the loud little Dior-printed dresses and a sexy gold bikini with a touch of screen-siren ruching in the bra—and some change in direction, as ethnic references were discarded in favor of all-out glamour. But there is now a sense of familiarity to this process and a feeling that Galliano’s poetry is getting lost in the machine.</p></div>"
27,spring,2003,s2003,christian-lacroix,"Fifteen years after his house was founded, Christian Lacroix continues to earn accolades and to add new strings to his bow. Appointed only months ago as creative director at Emilio Pucci, he was named last week as a chevalier in France's Legion of Honor.</p><p>In lieu of a pring show at the Carousel du Louvre, Lacroix scaled back and showed pieces from his signature jeans and Bazar lines, as well as some of his vintage couture designs, at an intimate dinner. All his signatures were in evidence: corsets, ethnic prints and metallic leathers, all joyously layered, many featuring embroidery and beading and worn with outsized jewelry and stunning gold warrior sandals.</p><p>At times, the styling—masks for the models, socks worn with evening shoes, bathing suits peeking out from under denim jeans—seemed at odds with the classic creations on view. Still, anything that helps reposition Lacroix as a versatile modern master, as opposed to the producer of the pouf skirt, is to be commended.</p></div>"
28,spring,2003,s2003,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo, undisputed high priestess of the avant-garde, has an unpredictable, ahead-of-the-pack mind-set that lends her shows a must-see quality. For spring, she set herself a new challenge: to decorate her clothes without using any external embellishments. She extended the fabric of her cotton garments by yards, tying and braiding the extra cloth to form bunchy plaits and rosettes, and the project resulted in a bulky silhouette constructed of boleros, long skirts and tunics festooned with outcrops of chunky 3-D effects. It made for one of Comme des Garçons’ more theoretical collections, which die-hard Kawakubo fans will no doubt wear as an act of art appreciation.</p><p>The designer is not completely disconnected, though, from mainstream seasonal thinking. She experimented with intense color and produced an amazing combination of fuchsia and candy pink among the olives, whites and black. And there at the center of it all was the cargo pant—the summer trend <em>sans frontière.</em></p></div>"
29,spring,2003,s2003,costume-national,"If fashion designers were each assigned a signature car, Costume National’s Ennio Capasa would undoubtedly end up with a sleek, dark Ferrari. Capasa strips trends down to their essential elements without taking away the slick sex appeal, and the result for spring was a collection with both visual and commercial clout.</p><p>The predominantly black palette was a bit heavy for a spring show, although it was leavened with white, gray, and occasional bits of apricot and mauve or beading and embroidery. Capasa kept it skinny (tight pants, slim skirts), mini (the briefest dresses, skirts and shorts) and bare (lots of spaghetti straps and sheer chiffon, including some tops worn over puzzling strappy bondage pieces reminiscent of Helmut Lang). It wasn't a groundbreaking show, but there was plenty to appeal to that trend-hungry customer who wants her clothes to look as cutting edge as she is.</p></div>"
30,spring,2003,s2003,d-g,"After a jaunty trek through the Tyrol for their fall D&amp;G collection, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana took the secondary line back to familiar territory—sunny southern Italy—for spring. The show combined local pride, classical references and modern moxie, all bound together with a healthy dose of sex appeal.</p><p>Touristy T-shirts printed with various Rome-related slogans and the D&amp;G logo were a mainstay of the line. But in the hands of the designers, what could have been airport souvenir fare was morphed into fashion: slashed, cropped and shredded to within an inch of <em>Flashdance</em>. The pieces appeared alone as very mini dresses, or came paired with baseball jackets cropped bust-high, vividly colored sheer chiffon ponchos and shredded tight jeans. Other looks on offer included tiny bras and loose, drapy silk tops, combat microshorts and ruffly minis. There were glamorous oversize glasses and gold baseball caps to ward off those intense Mediterranean midday rays and, for strolling around town, what must surely be the season's cheeriest footwear: sneakers on built-up rainbow platform soles worthy of '70s funkster George Clinton.</p></div>"
31,spring,2003,s2003,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane Von Furstenberg got her start as a working woman's designer. Granted, with her aristocratic European pedigree, she wasn't exactly punching a clock. But those just-feminine-enough jersey wrap dresses were a godsend for fashionable career women fed up with the rules of <em>Dress for Success</em>.</p><p>Thirty years later, DVF—now with the help of creative director Nathan Jenden—is outfitting a new generation, for whom things have loosened up a bit. Her career-minded customer still wants work-friendly clothes, but she wants them to have some spirit, too. And she'd also like a couple of sexy party dresses or a silky, skin-baring blouse for her equally hectic after-hours activities. Von Furstenberg, intent on keeping her loyal customers satisfied, aims to meet all those needs and then some with her expanding collection. This season, she dropped some of the eccentric cuts and brash color schemes of her fall show, softened her silhouettes and mixed in plenty of pretty prints and floaty chiffons. The line ran from sweet, sheer bias-cut dance dresses to sexy, tight pinstripe suits and sporty denim pieces.</p><p>It was a lot to take in—but then again, women's lives have gotten a lot busier over the last three decades. And if there were any doubts about DVF's appeal to the modern working woman, the hearty applause from her power-heavy front row—Diane Sawyer, Ellen Barkin, Julianne Moore, Candace Bushnell, Natasha Richardson, Bianca Jagger—should lay them to rest. Right next to the shoulder pads.</p></div>"
32,spring,2003,s2003,dkny,"Donna Karan's DKNY shows are like flash dispatches from the trend trenches. Flippy pleated minis! Retro-tinged dresses! Cargo capri pants! Short shorts and pencil skirts! Mixed and matched by Karan's inimitable hand, they zing by in her high-energy shows.</p><p>Karan laid out the basic components of her spring vision with her opening group, done in giddy bubblegum pink: a balmacaan raincoat over a polka-dot top; a soft sweater worn with a full skirt; and a lightweight jacket worn over short shorts. From there, she added in a few retro-spirited dresses, like a loose-cut navy polka-dot chiffon shift worn over cropped trousers, in the style of the new mod girls. Skirts are Karan’s new favorite item, and she showed plenty: knee-length pleated versions, mood-altering minis with pep to spare, slim pencils that sat low on the hip. And since jackets are always important to Karan's stylish working customer, she threw in a few variations on that theme: curvy fitted styles, boxy denim versions and cropped bombers.</p></div>"
33,spring,2003,s2003,dolce-gabbana,"The glamazons were out in force at Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Eva Herzigova, Naomi Campbell, Amber Valletta, Stephanie Seymour and Gisele Bündchen blasted into the room, walking proof that power-womanhood is not extinct on planet Fashion. And what do these ultra-women wear? Dolce &amp; Gabbana—who are at their best when turning women into stars. This season's collection laid out the full repertoire.</p><p>The list of influences is rather disparate—astronauts, Paco Rabanne, Sid Vicious, sailors and ancient Rome. Don’t worry too much about how all that hangs together. They were merely the channels for the line's enduring themes: curvaceous dresses, hourglass suits, masculine and feminine tailoring, amazing embellished coats and jeans.</p><p>The punk idea brought out S&amp;M crisscross lacing in the satin corseted dresses, straps and buckles on trousers, a new oversize jacket in the house's signature mannish suits, and heavy studwork on leather jackets and bags. Space-age was a way to work silver (Milan’s current favorite) as zippered foil coats, jackets and pants, while M. Rabanne got a nod by way of jackets made from bands of chinchilla and chain mail. The most uplifting moment, though, was the sight of Ms. Seymour in a shirred, black jersey dress, looking like an ’80s-era sex-on-legs goddess. It was just like old times, in more ways than one. The dress turned out to be Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s own—vintage.</p></div>"
34,spring,2003,s2003,donna-karan,"After several seasons spent voyaging inward, Donna Karan is clearly in the mood to go out and get down. Her New Age woman has left the ashram and is now on the hunt for a cold beer and some hot jazz.</p><p>Karan opened with a series of very businesslike jackets and coats whose built-up shoulders, brass buttons and stitching details recalled the exaggerated power-woman suits of the ’40s. But she quickly softened the mood with pretty jersey wrap dresses bound with generous sashes and knee-length skirts that either hugged the body or swirled out in circles. While most of the collection stuck to black, cream, navy and nude, Karan threw in some bold prints and bright colors—she even called one her ""celebration print""—to spice things up. Her eyelet pieces, in poppy-red or blue on a cream background, were perfect for spring.</p><p>Karan's customer is bound to be tired after a day in the boardroom and a night at the club, but this is not a woman who wears sweats around the house. She'll wrap herself up in the sweeping black-and-white satin kimono that the designer used to close the show, before she drifts off to dream of the next day’s festivities</p></div>"
35,spring,2003,s2003,dries-van-noten,"Hello, glamazons; farewell, luxe nomads. The spring shows have made it very clear that the international bohemian has, for the most part, taken down her yurt and switched over to a steady diet of cargo pants and satin dresses. That could spell trouble for a designer like Dries Van Noten, whose stock in trade—pretty, ethnic-inspired dresses and tops, gently generous silhouettes, and unique colors—was perfect for the haute hippie trend.</p><p>But just because the fashion caravan has moved on, that doesn't mean Van Noten will. He has a loyal customer, and this collection will provide her with an ample spring wardrobe. The designer showed plenty of his signature full, stripy skirts paired with limp knit tank tops, and he gave a quick nod to current styles in the form of satin tank tops, a few cropped blouson jackets and some pretty chiffon dresses. Where he really let fly, though, was in his masterful, inventive color palette. Any designer who can put together combinations like turquoise and brown, wine and orange, or lemon and apricot (to name just a few) is clearly capable of setting his own itinerary.</p></div>"
36,spring,2003,s2003,eley-kishimoto,"The husband-and-wife team of Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto has gathered a cult following for their charming, vaguely retro sensibility and their way with prints. In Eley Kishimoto’s world, life is the endless summer afternoon of an unsophisticated girlhood, a picture conjured by a warm nostalgia for an idea of cozy English domesticity circa 1950.</p><p>For next summer, the Eley Kishimoto ingenue will go about her errands in cotton pinafores with piping, sweet dresses in picnic checks, ginghams and polka dots, and skirts patterned with bold, loopy ’50s prints. When she goes to the seaside, she’ll have a cute cotton bikini with a frilled bottom, and if it rains, there are lots of nice raincoats to wear. For all occasions, there are lovely printed sneakers and flats shoes, to put a colorful spring in her step.</p></div>"
37,spring,2003,s2003,emanuel-ungaro,"Where does a ruffle-loving designer go when tight pants are on the season's screen? España, naturally, with its flamenco frills and matador pants. Emanuel Ungaro designer Giambattista Valli made it his destination for a spring fiesta of femininity, which reveled in lavish color, prints and a sexy, leggy silhouette.</p><p>The collection included just about everything a woman might need for endless hot summer nights. There were short one-shoulder and strapless dresses, in coral and mixed polka dots and florals, for a youthful cocktail. For serious seduction, there were gowns with deep plunges and high slits, and a lineup of super-beaded sparklers for the big event. It all could have sunk in a veritable Niagara of waterfall ruffles, but Valli's increasing confidence kept it afloat.</p><p>His knack is adding a few shots of playful cool to the mix. Well-tailored matador pants got a dash of punk with zipped ankles and the odd strap and D-ring, and some of the cropped jackets were slightly urban-biker. Nicely handled color clashes, gutsy scarab bags and a general air of undone spontaneity gave Ungaro's Spanish the right kind of accent for the moment.</p></div>"
38,spring,2003,s2003,emilio-pucci,"The glorious heritage of Emilio Pucci—all those fabulous, swirly psychedelic prints—has been crying out for a genetic match with a designer who can give it new life. And who better than Christian Lacroix, a man who has color, pattern and a sense of the sunny Mediterranean imprinted on his very soul?</p><p>Lacroix has taken his first season in the Pucci hot seat very seriously but with a light heart. There are few designers as accomplished with bold color as he, and this collection showed his skills. He put purple with brown and pistachio, mixed coral and turquoise with yellow, and printed the patterns on floaty chiffons and the house's signature slinky jersey. His harem pants, one-shoulder goddess tunics over leggings, and dresses that trailed handkerchief points all keyed into a Technicolor fantasy of an endless summer pool party. That should go down just beautifully in Saint-Tropez, St. Bart’s, Ibiza and the like. City dwellers craving a slice of the dream found something, too: a few mad, bright tracksuits, a pair of classic Pucci capri pants and a fantastic purple-and-green satiny-cotton trench, which will defy the misery of any rainy day.</p></div>"
39,spring,2003,s2003,emma-cook,"Emma Cook’s Spring collection, her first official solo catwalk show, played like the ’60s as seen by a child of the ’80s. The 26-year-old designed her presentation around an imaginary woman named Suzistyrene, a character she dreamed up after watching <em>Barbarella</em> and doing some thinking about ’80s sportswear. Suzi, it turns out, has charm and individual style to spare.</p><p>Cook worked ’60s themes—clear plastic inserts in shift dresses, shiny PVC and patchwork suede—alongside ’80s elements like jersey with shoulder cutouts, and straps and buckles reminiscent of Duran Duran. PVC raincoats with Liberty-style prints and suede overalls and dresses, meanwhile, had more than a whiff of Mary Quant and Jean Muir about them. Cook also referenced Paco Rabanne, via overdresses and neck pieces made of linked plastic circles and butterflies, but without getting heavy-handed or pretentious. All of which made for a lighthearted debut and a welcome breath of fresh air.</p></div>"
40,spring,2003,s2003,emporio-armani,"Emporio Armani may be the younger, second line in the universe of Giorgio Armani, but that doesn’t mean its presentation gets short shrift from the designer. He shepherds his audience to his monumental, gray Tadao Ando-designed auditorium, closes the vast iron doors behind them, and lifts the curtain on a lavish theatrical production that springs from his fantasy.</p><p>This time the script was a Cuban-flavored travelogue, played out by models in berets, some flicking unlit Havana cigars. They roamed a central stage, while behind them a huge screen showed a film of two Armani-clad gamines at play. The clothes picked up on the urban-revolutionary theme but translated in a light, sunshiny Italian way. The season's military trend was filtered into bombers, parkas and combat pants in aquas, teals and dusty browns, done in floppy, breezy fabrics for nonaggressive civilians.</p><p>Armani continued the motif of the gathered-ankle pant from his main line's collection last season via cropped combat trousers, and he used drawstrings to give interest to jackets and tops. For nighttime, he turned to sheer, black, mesh bush vests sprinkled with diamanté; then he closed with sparkly, swingy dresses in hot fuchsia and red.</p></div>"
41,spring,2003,s2003,fendi,"To enter the arena of Italian fashion is to take a ringside seat at a gladiatorial contest between luxury brands. That, at least, seemed to be the impression Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi were intent on creating as they sent out a posse of glam warrior girls, dressed for battle in skimpy body-skimming chiffons and leathers, and armed to the hilt with killer accessories.</p><p>Lagerfeld opened with dark-blue two-piece swimwear, lashed together with strips that crisscrossed the body and paired with high—<em>very</em> high—Roman sandals in metallic leather. Everything he showed from then on emphasized the honed body, whether in light, tightly seamed tailoring, sheer, lacy knits or short, asymmetrical goddess dresses finished with matte silver sequins. The combat theme extended through cutout-metal armlets, chokers and even filigree-encrusted sunglasses.</p><p>Spring’s major assault, though, came in the shape of the Biga, a soft, exotic shoulder bag named after a Roman chariot. The gold-and-silver-mesh version, studded with Swarovski crystal, together with a rich-looking leather style embossed to look like feathers, seem primed to emerge victors in the next round of the epic 21st-century handbag wars.</p></div>"
42,spring,2003,s2003,frostfrench,"FrostFrench is the playful brainchild of actress Sadie Frost and her partner Jemima French. <em>Child</em> is very much the operative word here, since Frost coproduced the collection while pregnant with her fourth child—and produced him four days before the show.</p><p>And the lighthearted event, staged in an outdoor amphitheater in Regent’s Park, had all the atmosphere of a family picnic organized by groovy mommies, the kind who pick girl-rock music (Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon, Annabella Lwin) and still want to wear sexy, flirty clothes.</p><p>This wasn’t a collection touting domestic goddesses or old-time feminist style, though. <em>Empowered to flirt</em> is more FrostFrench’s approach—not surprising considering they started as a cheeky underwear label, a fact the audience was reminded of when some of the models flipped their skirts and wiggled their satin-clad behinds. The label has evolved, of course, and now produces pretty clothes like lace tops and dresses, provocative dungarees cut to define long legs, ’70s-style jeans with topstitched seams, terrycloth hoodies, and plenty of floaty, printed chiffon dresses, secured at the waist with chain belts dangling plastic hearts. The designers, refreshingly, thought of all the stages of a fashionable young woman’s life, from the short shorts of youth to the stylish togs of modern motherhood—including that hot new accessory, the FrostFrench baby sling.</p></div>"
43,spring,2003,s2003,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré is a serious designer who cares about ""old-school"" ideas like cool elegance and perfect tailoring. In a season full of giddy, color-saturated fashion seemingly inspired by <em>animé</em> characters, his collection stood out for its restrained, mature focus.</p><p>Ferré kept his color palette subdued (chocolate brown, tobacco, charcoal and ivory with judiciously placed blasts of yellow and scarlet) and his silhouettes fairly traditional. Skirts came near the knee, trousers were fluid and jackets cut loose, but not gigantic. In a nod to current trends, the designer showed a lemon-yellow bomber jacket, a few cargo pockets and plenty of chiffon. But Ferré’s own innovation comes via cut and proportion; he can make a fitted jacket look fresh just by tweaking the collar-span-to-waistline ratio. A longtime admirer of Japanese technique, he also worked Asian motifs like block prints, narrow-cut kimono sleeves slashed to expose the arms, obi-wrapped midriffs and asymmetrical cuts into the line.</p><p>Not everything was about cool intellect, though; there were skimpy lingerie dresses, whispery sheer blouses slipping off shoulders and loose silk jackets swinging open to flash some skin. And a group of liquid silk charmeuse dresses finished off the show with a blast of heat that sent the mercury skyrocketing.</p></div>"
44,spring,2003,s2003,gibo,"Julie Verhoeven is a London illustrator and freelance designer whose kooky talent has been bubbling behind the fashion scene for a decade. She’s done stints with John Galliano and Martine Sitbon, and was brought in two seasons ago by Marc Jacobs to design the cute, nutty patchwork animal bags for Louis Vuitton.</p><p>Now, with the backing of the giant Italian manufacturer Gibo, Verhoeven has been thrust into the limelight with her own collection. At 33, she’s a child of the ’80s, and the girl she sent out is the personification of the teen who came of age listening to Yaz and Culture Club. She paraded two-tone graphics and clashing color–blocked outfits, frilly blouses, rah-rah skirts and conical-heel pumps. The collection is self-consciously clunky—clothes for a girl making a desperate stab at being glam for her first foray to a disco, only to spend the evening blushing in the corner. Haven’t we all been there?</p><p>Gibo has serious plans for Verhoeven’s designs, including opening a store here next January. Franco Penne, who heads up the company, said he chose a Londoner to create this collection because “Milan is about business, but London, whether it is up or down, is about creativity.”</p></div>"
45,spring,2003,s2003,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani is one of the few living designers who still care to address the needs of a professional woman in search of a suit. For spring, he applied himself to softening up the staple in a variety of ways. A gray suit was given a younger feel with the addition of a hip, stripy underpiece, while pants became more casual via elastic waists or drawstring details at the ankle. More surprising—especially for the man who pioneered androgynous ease in women’s tailoring—was his latest suggestion for a skirt to put under a jacket: a tight, sexy knee-length pencil in satin.</p><p>Armani's eveningwear attracts a big following as well—and the reason was lined up in the front row of his show, where celebrities Kim Cattrall, Tina Turner and Sophia Loren were scanning the runway for red-carpet suggestions. The designer offered them a huge range of possibilities, made of subtle Italian fabrics, often with an Oriental flavor to the cut and color. From long skirts paired with tiny, supple leather jackets right through to strapless and beaded gowns, the best moments were the simple ones. The standout? A dramatic body-skimming floor-length column in caf¿ au lait jersey.</p></div>"
46,spring,2003,s2003,givenchy,"For Givenchy, Julien Macdonald surfed several of the trend waves that are crashing on the fashion beach for summer. That meant Mediterranean-style versions of the season's ultra-short, sporty and combat-inspired looks, and hot doses of color.</p><p>Ignoring the house's former reputation for elegant, ladylike suits, Macdonald cut a white piqué jacket with matching micro shorts and paired a classic black jacket with sheer mesh trousers. His focus then turned mostly on resort clothes aimed at those who vacation in places like Saint-Tropez—and whose idea of fashion is to accessorize their hot-pink swimwear with a see-through sport jacket. Rounding out the casually dressy options were shredded lavender denims, and suede jackets and jeans done in vivid jungle-pattern patchwork. For evening, Macdonald channeled the current feeling for goddessy dresses and prints. His best: a black plissé-silk dress with a black empire waistband.</p></div>"
47,spring,2003,s2003,gucci,"The Gucci girl’s got legs—long, tan, flawless ones striding along on silver peep-toe sling-back pumps. Follow them all the way up, and around two weeks later, they eventually meet the hem of the minutest piece of clothing that was ever called a skirt or dress. For spring, in a word, Tom Ford says <em>short.</em></p><p>Using lustrous fabrics in subtle makeup colors from blush to tawny brown, pearly gray and silver, Ford draped and wrapped his gorgeous girls in clothes that navigated that dangerous Gucci line between innovation and vulgarity. The tousled hair, the jackets and tops poised to fall off shoulders—the whole presentation stirred sensations that fashion hasn’t felt since the last days of the great supermodels.</p><p>Still, don’t think tacky. Ford’s obsession now is integrating fine workmanship into abbreviated silhouettes. He took the idea of a kimono and portrayed it first as a simple silk beach cover-up, then as an elegant formfitting dress, painstakingly made from hand-painted strips of silk. He brought couture finesse to racer-back feathered dresses with the merest flip of a skirt. And with lightest touch, he wove white and rose gold into fragile ribbons to tie around wrists—the most modern-looking jewelry in Milan. When Carmen Kass closed the show in a dress made entirely of the same precious ribbon, it was a confident statement in the power of glamour. And fashion needs that.</p></div>"
48,spring,2003,s2003,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow’s collection fulfilled all the promise of innovation and thrill that visitors to London hope for. In a concise and beautifully conceived show, he managed to combine a feeling for real sportswear, a sense of glamour, fantastic juxtapositions of color and—rarest of all—truly original cutting.</p><p>The first outfit consisted of a jacket made of beige mackintosh fabric with raised inside-out seaming, its futuristic cut softened by an explosion of scallop-edged embroidered fabric at the front. He sustained that level of delight and surprise with glamorous pale bronze and purple satin dresses in loose, sporty cuts; interesting wrapped tailoring; and witty elements, like Lurex tank tops and neck pieces of huge, chunky crystal. One sparkling highlight was a heavily beaded T-shirt paired with lime-green running shorts.</p><p>Morrow’s confident touch even managed to turn the subject of bright, shiny prints—often used ironically on the London runways—into something that looked like a chic, avant-garde proposition. Tempered by his cool tailoring, the foil-Jacquard bombers and tailored jackets came across as wholly desirable, a leap of imagination rather than the usual tongue-in-cheek ’80s reference.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""xs5ou3v""></div></div><p>Up to now, Morrow’s experimental shows have been confined to the realm of theory. But this collection, he promises, will actually make it to the retail floor. Once there, it will go a long way toward restoring London’s reputation as a leader in real design intelligence.</p></div>"
49,spring,2003,s2003,helmut-lang,"After five years in New York, Helmut Lang returned to the same white space in Paris where he has sent out some of his finest collections—designs that changed the face of fashion. The atmosphere at the spring show was charged with nostalgia and anticipation. Would he hit those highs again?</p><p>The collection he showed was a case of revisiting the roots of his genre: layered T-shirt dressing, skinny pants, signature slim overcoats, abstracted prints, punky materials recontextualized. But time has passed. Since Lang has been in New York, his once raw, plugged-in connection to underground sources has been replaced by a quest for sophistication, expressed in abstract detailing and luxe materials. So the coats and pants got inserts or sleeves constructed of mesh, chiffon and leather. The T-shirts were often reduced to complex traceries of string. And there was cool white-beaded eveningwear, as a zippered dress or fragile jacket, intended to shine on a red carpet somewhere.</p><p>The change had to happen: as Lang well understands, minimalism is over, and his followers, like he is, are moving on. But that doesn't mean that they can't still be seduced by the designer's classic codes. Latex, bound and pieced into garments, hit just the right buttons, particularly in a pristine yellow-and-white-printed dress with a flip of the white stuff as its skirt.</p></div>"
50,spring,2003,s2003,imitation-of-christ,"""It's madness!"" said Chlo¿ Sevigny of the event staged by Imitation of Christ at the Maurice Villency furniture showroom in midtown Manhattan. ""Madness, in a good way."" Inside the all-white space, models mingled with their boyfriends and art-world luminaries, and the audience struggled to avoid getting mangled by the swarming paparazzi hungry for shots of IOC designer Tara Subkoff (in painted dress, Erickson Beamon dangling earring and cheeky fedora) and current flame Jimmy Fallon (in green military jacket).</p><p>Like all IOC events, the spring show, billed as a ""retrospective,"" was more about performance art and cultural theory than clothes. On the ground floor, topless models in very abbreviated shorts pranced around while pushing shiny vacuum cleaners (very David LaChapelle meets Vanessa Beecroft). They were flanked by vitrines filled with grass and live butterflies, and downstairs the Black Dice played cacophonous instrumental music as art videos and tapes of old IOC shows flickered on the walls.</p><p>A commentary on the hothouse worlds of art and fashion? A metaphor for the separation between viewer and viewed (a well-worn IOC theme)? Whatever the intention, the end result was that the label's pretty, wearable clothes were—once again—sacrificed to the spectacle.</p></div>"
51,spring,2003,s2003,istvan-francer,"A former assistant to Donna Karan, Istvan Francer is now emerging as a designer in his own right with the backing of Finpart, the owners of Cerruti. His third collection was evidence both of his experience in cutting and of his intelligent approach to the art of modern dressing. Though his silhouette was based on a tight, tiny top and a swirling skirt—an outline emerging everywhere now—he put his personal stamp on it. A Hungarian background gives the deisgner a taste for the decorative and romantic, which came through in gauzy black and gold lace dresses and some peasant-derived embroidery on a curvy jacket. Such distinctive characteristics were balanced by the designer’s light-handed, flattering touch, and the show marked a promising step along the road away from costume and toward wearability.</p></div>"
52,spring,2003,s2003,james-coviello,"Best known as the man behind Anna Sui's distinctive knits, James Coviello has been slowly building up his own sportswear line over the last two years. His spring collection was conclusive proof that he has an eye—and a wit—all his own.</p><p>Like many designers of his generation, Coviello likes to work a bit of retro irony into his collection, but he kept it from being cloying by adding just a touch of tough street edge. He took spring's ubiquitous sherbet colors and pushed them just a few hues deeper, resulting in unusual, interesting combinations: mauve and yellow, chartreuse and raspberry, lime and nude tones. A Fair Isle sweater got reworked as a ballet-neck tank top, paired with a skinny skirt; a full-skirted, floral-print dress was saved from becoming saccharine by the addition of a goofy, oversize bow and a very genteel black leather dog collar at the throat. Coviello's basics—pencil skirts, loose jackets and slim trousers—played smart second fiddle to lovely crocheted tops and snappy striped cardigans.</p></div>"
53,spring,2003,s2003,jean-paul-gaultier,"Having fun with a pun sometimes leads Jean Paul Gaultier to supreme elegance—other times to mayhem. This season, he got carried away with the idea of Alexander Calder's mobile sculptures, a concept he worked into a frenzy of visual quips about strings and suspension.</p><p>Opening with a tableau of circus acrobats twirling in the air on rings, swings and ropes of cloth, Gaultier followed up with a kind of anarchic rock-star parade, riffing on his chosen theme. There were overalls with the bib hanging down from one strap, swimsuits in abstract shapes held together with strings, and—every woman's worst nightmare—pants and tights falling down to reveal underwear. Throw in some touches of Victoriana, a couple of Indian saris and a few men's shirts and jackets tied on backward, and the joke gets strung out too long.</p><p>Calder, on the other hand, had nothing to do with the designer's best pieces. Hang a medal on Gaultier for the belt-size pleated miniskirts worn over super-skinny pants and, most of all, for the East-meets-West kimono-sleeve silky sport jackets with embroidery on the back.</p></div>"
54,spring,2003,s2003,jeremy-scott,"Relevance to modern life—and the modern fashion consumer—never seems to be at the forefront of Jeremy Scott's mind. He sees fashion more as an opportunity for cheeky social commentary (as in his ""I want money"" collection, where models threw fake gold coins into the audience) and a chance to indulge his sense of tongue-in-cheek, kitschy retro-futurism. Sometimes timely and amusing, his collections can also easily veer into the realm of gimmick.</p><p>Scott’s spring show, called ""Venus Rising,"" might as well have been called ""Valley Girls in Space."" With a rock-covered stage set and models sporting pointy Vulcan eyebrows and popped-up shoulders, the event recalled his space-age fall presentation, though with a more restrained group of colors. The designer started with some cute, wearable pieces including simple fitted minidresses and jersey shorts and tops. He then segued into a rainbow of bathing suits, some consisting of a mere strip or two of fabric. That was followed by a group of dresses, each with a distinct identity: One featured a pheasant-feather bodice over a shredded tan chiffon skirt, another was a simple silky robe in sea colors.</p><p>Scott clearly has enough imagination and skill to makes his shows consistently memorable. But his focus on developing a recognizable signature—and the business to go with it—could be stronger.</p></div>"
55,spring,2003,s2003,jil-sander,"When Jil Sander walked away from the house that bears her name, its experimental, intellectual ethos went with her, ending a chapter in fashion history. Now, with a design team headed by former retailer Milan Vukmirovic, the line’s emphasis is making commercially viable sportswear.</p><p>Spring’s direction is literally just that: a collection based on sporty clothing, a theme that emerged on London’s runways two weeks ago. Opening the show was a big, black, zippered cotton parka over shorts, paired with a shoe that is a cross between a high pump and a thong. The zipper motif was further explored in a punkish short dress and a sleeveless blouson, and eventually evolved into a tank top constructed of woven zips and a short dress made from a ballooning cascade of fasteners.</p><p>A workout theme took over as Vukmirovic converted track pants, T-shirts and anoraks into luxury pieces using perforated leather, sheer fabrics and mesh. It all culminated in a gold bugle-beaded top ready for a sprint round the summer party circuit.</p></div>"
56,spring,2003,s2003,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart’s trendy, youthful line is aimed squarely at the hip urban woman who is on first-name terms with the latest denim lines and the coolest DJs. Stuart started as a handbag designer before branching out into clothing, and although her designs may not be breaking new ground, she has a sharp sense of how to put her own spin on the current looks.</p><p>For spring, that meant a palette of colors that looked as though they’d been softened by time and wear—dusty rose, ivory, blue-gray and pale indigo. Stuart showed some nice takes on the boxy jackets and slim skirts that are in wide distribution this season, and there was a sweet nostalgia to some of the pieces, like a pink quilted satin jacket that looked like it was made from a comforter and a pretty black dress with a paper-bag neckline that would suit a modern Holly Golightly. But many of the styles evoked a more recent era. Oversize sweaters slipping off shoulders, low-riding pleated pants (paging Z. Cavaricci!) and cargo pants that ended in ribbed cuffs—all shown to a soundtrack that included Thomas Dolby and Dexy’s Midnight Runners—made the ’80s come back to life. For Stuart’s hip chick, that’s this year’s moment.</p></div>"
57,spring,2003,s2003,john-galliano,"When a model with a blue-painted face, wearing a giant tinsel hood, a vast exploding bubble of ruffles, green Lurex leggings and six-inch glitter platforms opens a show, we sense we are not exactly in for the average run-through of clothes to buy for summer. What John Galliano did instead was to lay on an outrageous piece of performance art, a spectacle that flew exuberantly in the face of fashion's normal purpose.</p><p>As inspiration for his latest piece of theater, the designer cited, among other things, Leigh Bowery, icon of early '80s London club culture. Galliano's 2003 homage to that era, in which competitive dressing was taken to ever more bizarre heights of do-it-yourself costume, took the form of enormously puffed-up shapes supported on hoops and covered in flounces; massive military jackets; swathes of sari fabric; and Indian-inspired makeup and jewelry.</p><p>Though someone searching for something to wear among this lot might have a hard time, Galliano is nothing if not sensitized to the current mood in fashion. The general message the collection conveyed was about the enjoyment of color, which has emerged as a major trend for spring. For his finale, he sent out girls whose voluminous outfits were covered in colored powders used in Indian festivals. As the models twirled, the audience was showered—and, incredibly, responded with laughter. As Galliano said, ""It's about time for a bit of joie de vivre, isn't it?""</p></div>"
58,spring,2003,s2003,julien-macdonald,"In a move that signaled the beginning of another episode of the ’80s déjà vu fest that has been playing all over London, Naomi Campbell opened Julien Macdonald’s show strutting her remarkably buff stuff in a white, cutout, rhinestone-studded swimsuit. Macdonald loves glamour, gorgeous girls, eye-socking color, vivid prints, high heels and big hair. Sound familiar? Maybe the thought of the upcoming Gianni Versace retrospective at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum inspired him. Whatever the source, the designer’s collection seemed a frank homage to those carefree days when supermodels prowled the runways wearing nothing very much to maximum possible effect.</p><p>Macdonald worked through grommet-studded jersey and leather pieces, strapless, frilly eyelet looks, and many variations on the theme of microscopically short asymmetric dresses (previous incarnations of which have proved a publicity godsend to many grateful London It girls).</p><p>The designer threw himself into a carnival spirit with multicolored print chiffons topped by outsize headdresses and shoulder pieces made of Caribbean flowers and vegetation—it’s summer, after all. Even if his glammed-up nostalgia isn’t to everyone’s taste, you have to credit Macdonald his relentless determination to show fashion a jolly good time.</p></div>"
59,spring,2003,s2003,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s show conjured a vision of innocent 18th-century milkmaids who had parachuted into a field of summer flowers. The girls seemed to have floated down from the sky under huge, airy umbrella hats, wearing drifty, white, flower-dotted prints suspended on webbing tape. Yes, webbing: in an original twist on this season’s ubiquitous combat trend, Watanabe made it look dreamily pretty. His prints, done in blue-and-white and rose-scattered fabrics, were made into cropped pants ruched into shorts and dresses hitched up at the hems. He also, thoughtfully, equipped his bucolic regiment with matching backpacks, some fused into the girls’ garments.</p><p>Watanabe’s was one of the few collections this season with a light, fresh take on summer dressing. But the designer could have made his point more effectively by editing out some of the variations on his theme, especially those in black and garish ’70s prints.</p></div>"
60,spring,2003,s2003,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli's intimate presentations, staged in her NoLIta store, are the perfect showcase for the designer's gently hip designs. A fan of under- rather than overstatement, Adeli lets trends murmur their way through her collection, rather than being shouted from the rooftops.</p><p>Her spring show suggested a country girl with glamorous ambitions. Adeli used tight jeans and snug overalls as a base layer over which she put delicate chiffon or jersey minidresses and tops. Her embellishments and styling referenced various decades: the '20s, the '70s (a flying eagle stretched across a white charmeuse top), the '80s (big ""boyfriend"" jackets over little dresses), but never glaringly so. Adeli also used a distinctive and eclectic palette: ivory, cobalt blue, canary yellow, black and tones of gray, along with the denim pieces. She may not be a verbose designer—the whole show was over in 14 looks—but Adeli's is a voice that carries.</p></div>"
61,spring,2003,s2003,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole makes the very flattering assumption that his customers are just as interested in being smart as they are in looking smart; that's (presumably) why his company has never hesitated to talk politics in its fashion ads. If you're a young, hip, liberal thinker, he seems to be saying, I can take care of you.</p><p>On the fashion front, being taken care of means having the prevailing trends clearly edited and presented—something that comes naturally to Cole. For spring, the designer showed tailored safari and motorcycle jackets in white, olive and taupe cotton, worn over swingy knee-length skirts, drapey jersey tops and sweet dresses with tiny floral prints. Cole avoided the ubiquitous cargo pant trend, keeping his trousers lean and low-cut instead. As might be expected from someone who made his name as a shoe designer, leather was sprinkled throughout: There were boxy jackets, suede skirts and plenty of extras like chain-link leather belts, generous shoulder bags and nifty gold toeless pumps.</p><p>More than half the looks that came down the runway were menswear; perhaps Cole is putting a bigger emphasis on building that part of his business. Or maybe he's realized that fashion, unlike politics, is truly an equal opportunity environment.</p></div>"
62,spring,2003,s2003,lagerfeld-gallery,"How to wear ultra-short? It's the brainteaser of spring fashion. For his Lagerfeld Gallery collection, Karl Lagerfeld gave shorts themselves a try. As part of the Diesel jeans group he integrates into the collection, Lagerfeld put frayed-edge denim shorts beneath minute chiffon dresses and under the teeny veils he had flipping around in place of evening skirts.</p><p>The jeans, with their signature center-front seam, sculpt the skinniest thigh on the planet. For spring, they're done in pale blue, cross-dyed purple and blue, faded black, or white, and lopped off just below the calf. Lagerfeld often put them under pretty lavender chiffon dresses for a more covered-up option.</p><p>For all the denim, this wasn't a casual collection. There was a Lagerfeldian framework that included formal jackets and crisp white shirt collars alongside feminine silk dresses. He did a few twists on the tux, including black taffeta-sleeved evening coats, cropped boleros and a white-tie vest. A line-up of pewter ciré swimsuits with boy-cut legs touched on the '60s trend. And the famously slimmed-down designer rivaled any model when he took his final bow in a pair of those long, leggy jeans.</p></div>"
63,spring,2003,s2003,lanvin,"Bouquets are due Alber Elbaz for excellent taste and innovative design aimed directly at the sophisticated women of the world. His spring collection for Lanvin was a rare vision of luxurious dressing, balancing luster with rawness in a grown-up, wearable way.</p><p>Elbaz composed the collection from four basic elements: rough-woven linen and gauzes, black satin ribbon, crystal jewelry and a color palette that ran from browns through bronze to dull gold. He started by taking on the difficult and much-neglected day suit, modernizing it by doing unlined, slubby jackets and skirts, leaving the edges raw and putting sheer blouses decorated with crystal and sequins underneath. The beauty was in the narrowness of the cut and the put-together look: flat Roman sandals made from satin ribbon, and hair pulled back in high buns and covered in black silk scarves, twinkling with a cool adaptation of the tiara. The designer also has a genius for dresses, which came in many variations on the goddess theme. The most exciting had clear silicone straps and what appeared to be integral jewelry at the neckline, creating the illusion that the whole garment was suspended by magic from the naked shoulder. Other evening options came in liquid gold satin and in a terra-cotta African-influenced print.</p><p>As a collection, Lanvin was a highly considered—and considerate—piece of work, executed with an impressive degree of respect for real women.</p></div>"
64,spring,2003,s2003,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs' latest for Louis Vuitton is so very <em>kawaii</em> (that's Japanese for ""cute"") it's going to drive young women everywhere utterly nuts. Girl nation was thrown for a loop when the designer sent out a pastel-rainbow troupe of sweethearts in duchesse-satin zip-up dresses with Peter Pan collars. They tripped along carrying the latest monogram bags, perked up by computerized prints of little flowers and cartoon creatures, the work of the latest LV guest artist, Takashi Murakami.</p><p>The collection radiated a sunny '50s- and '60s-style optimism via little dresses, jackets, swingy skirts, knits and bathing suits finished with minute edgings of frills and tiny bows. There were strappy dresses with raised waists, some formfitting and others flared, done in a palette that ranged from the prettiest champagne through rose, lemon, pistachio and sky-blue. Even the swimsuits had that cute flip of a modesty flounce circa 1960.</p><p>In this, his third stellar collection of the season, Jacobs proved just how adept he is at merging happy retro memories and modern pop culture. His smartest crossover moves? Morphing rubber into cherry-red polka-dot pencil skirts, macs and suits decorated with 3-D flowers, and cutting ladylike jackets and coats out of printed neoprene. Add in jokey Minnie Mouse bows on peep-toe slingbacks and the result was a collection that will have lines forming around the block at Louis Vuitton stores from the first day of spring.</p></div>"
65,spring,2003,s2003,luella,"In contrast to her last collection, a valentine to hippie romanticism, Luella Bartley turned out a hard-edged show influenced by everything, said the designer, “from surfing to motocross.”</p><p>Bartley opened with a series of low-waisted minis paired with semi-sheer, French-cut leotards that came off as tough, somewhat trampy and very clubby. Her affinity for denim was evident throughout, and those pieces were among the collection’s strongest, particularly a drop-waisted, button-front number with distressed patches that lent it a (calculated) thrift-shop flair. The suits—one in neon yellow, the other with Carnaby stripes—were well cut, if blinding.</p><p>Sorbet-colored jackets and shirts had a cheeky air augmented by embroidered legends like ""Tornado"" and, of course, ""Luella,"" while customized pink-and-white checkered Vans staked out a rebel-teen territory somewhere between <em>Blue Crush</em> and the East End of London.</p></div>"
66,spring,2003,s2003,m-r-s-,"M.R.S. started a few years ago as a side project for Molly Stern—something to do when she had time between jobs as a makeup artist for rock stars and celebrities. She would literally sew her cotton jersey tops and dresses right onto her clients’ bodies, using a signature overlock stitch on raw seams. Considering that those clients included friends like Milla Jovovich, Gisele Bündchen and Courtney Love, it's not surprising that Stern’s project took on a life of its own.</p><p>Now the M.R.S. line (those are Stern's initials) has become a real business, complete with its first fashion show, held at the Barneys Co-Op store in Soho. The designer presented her pastel-toned collection in a <em>tableau vivant</em> inspired by <em>How to Marry a Millionaire</em>. Each outfit came with a title and a narrative: a combination of drawstring pants and pink blouse was dubbed “Active Arts and Leisure""; a soft top paired with short shorts was labeled ""The Front Porch Relaxer""; and a short, frilly halter dress was titled ""The Saturday Night Swisher,"" Stern wisely kept things light and brief by showing only 16 outfits, each with enough pert charm to keep its wearer smiling all through the spring.</p></div>"
67,spring,2003,s2003,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The magic of Marc by Marc Jacobs, the designer’s popular secondary line, is not in revolutionary shapes or cuts. It’s in the way he puts it together, as though channeling the wardrobe whims of an imaginary girl whose moods, and outfits, shift from moment to moment. One moment she’s an eccentric, artsy bohemian in a rainbow chiffon dress worn over a mock turtleneck and opaque black tights; the next, she’s dressed for a proper party in a sweet black knee-length dress with tiers of ruffles, or playing the coquette in a red check dress with a sweetheart neckline.</p><p>He may pick up a trend, but the Jacobs spin is what makes it inimitable. His skirts, cut slim or with an A-line flare, are done in sassy colors like red, pink, lemon yellow or mint, and paired with boxy cotton motorcycle jackets. Denim always plays a starring role in the Marc show, and this season it showed up in a sexy little spaghetti-strap dress, slim cropped trousers and a zip-front mechanic’s jumpsuit replete with zippers. There were also plenty of the skinny trench coats that have become a signature item, done in traditional khaki but also in eye-snapping yellow or tomato red. The Marc girl can rest assured that, no matter what her mood, she’ll find something to love.</p></div>"
68,spring,2003,s2003,marc-jacobs,"Hard and soft, past and present, good girl and bad girl—Marc Jacobs loves to play with opposites. For Spring, he worked all those elements together into a collection that was sweet but with a hint of a hard edge—like a debutante who knows the bartender's name, or like Exene Cervenka, the lead singer of L.A. punk band X, whose songs made up the bulk of the night's soundtrack.</p><p>Part of the season's interesting dichotomy came from the silhouette: Jacobs cut a more frankly feminine shape than he has in the recent past, with deep necklines on full-skirted dresses, body-hugging sheaths under boxy jackets, and snug pencil skirts or cigarette pants paired with sexy camisole tops. And part of it was his flower-garden color choices: soft pink, lavender, pale yellow, orange, chartreuse, and ivory. For even greater contrast, he manipulated soft, airy fabrics like satin, lace, and cashmere against dense ribbed ottoman, nubby, Chanel-evoking tweeds, and silk shantung.</p><p>Jacobs brings in retro references both obliquely and directly; this season, he picked up bits from the cocktail-shaker days of the fifties and sixties: tiny bows and rolled collars, woozy polka-dot prints, ""cocktail"" dresses made from lace and satin. But despite its knowing dalliance with the past, this was a collection rooted very firmly in the here and now.</p></div>"
69,spring,2003,s2003,markus-lupfer,"Markus Lupfer doesn’t usually make overtly sexy clothes. When he arrived on the London scene in the late ’90s, his style was all about revisiting ladylike classics with an avant-garde sensibility. But things have moved on, and Lupfer has now revved up his ideas to suit a leggy London girl who likes to go out. He’s also caught on to several of the trends emerging on the city’s runways: short jersey dresses, bright colors, all-in-ones and raunchy ’80s-flavored sport clothes.</p><p>Lupfer updated winter combat pants, in white cotton, by simplifying them—cropping them at the knee and putting them with high heels and a drapey cream lace tank. His all-in-ones came as either loose, faded dungarees or fitted overalls that had nothing to do with auto mechanics. His dresses, in single shots of orange jersey or mixed-print chiffon, came short and bloused up at the waist, to give a flippy volume to the skirt. Throughout the collection, Lupfer found fresh uses for his well-known skills with print and leather. There were dotty, orange-and-white plunging swimsuits, bold neon-pink zigzags and punched-out summer leathers made into mini trapeze dresses and skirts. Looks like he’s left his artsy librarian far behind.</p></div>"
70,spring,2003,s2003,marni,"Seems like the Marni hippie chick has been on a trip uptown. She still loves pretty prints and fabrics derived from antique furnishings, but for spring, she’s taken a style diversion, adding both haute accessories and biker references to the eclectic mix.</p><p>Designer Consuelo Castiglioni’s favorite things—shrunken jackets, print dresses, stripy pants and delicate lacy camisoles—were all there, present and correct, in her summer collection, as was her knack for casually layering one precious, romantic piece on top of another. But those familiar ticking stripes this time came in satin, cut into pants and asymmetric skirts. A tougher, glossier Marni was also playing around with sexy leather vests and zip-detailed pants. Most surprising of all, Castiglioni flung off the clogs, hippie belts and ethnic bags: all her accessories for spring looked like an homage to vintage Hermès, from the stack-heeled canvas sandals to the chunky belts laden with gilt hardware.</p></div>"
71,spring,2003,s2003,martine-sitbon,"Who says Americans have the market cornered on clever sportswear? Martine Sitbon's spring show was a distinctly French commentary on current trends that proved smart design knows no borders.</p><p>Most of the season's usual suspects were present and accounted for: blouson jackets, lingerie pieces, jumpsuits and micro shorts, sport influences, and utility details. But Sitbon is one of those designers who can reference the themes of the moment without relinquishing her own (artsy) identity. She softened a safari jacket by cutting it in pale-lavender satin, and feminized the sport motif by using wide, striped ribbon—inserted here and there on short, swingy jersey dresses, wrapped around bodices and run down the seam of slim satin pants.</p><p>Sitbon knows how to flatter the ins and outs of a woman's figure with innovative cutting, although sometimes she piled up too many ideas in one outfit. But in a season full of me-too collections—seemingly aimed at a teenage constituency—her strong sense of self was refreshing. And who else but a French designer would be so comfortable making corsets and garter belts the basis of a series of sexy little dresses?</p></div>"
72,spring,2003,s2003,matthew-williamson,"“Hello, is there anybody home?” were the lyrics that opened Matthew Williamson’s second New York show, just seconds after Britney Spears had arrived wearing a printed, beaded top from the designer’s new collection. Signaling the high wattage of the event, her fellow front-row occupants included Helena Christensen, Carine Roitfeld, Mario Testino, and a regiment of Sykes sisters.</p><p>Titled “Flamingo Bay,” the show was a sumptuous distillation of all Williamson’s strengths into one long, cool fashion cocktail that is sure to be seen around town and in magazine editorials for months to come. The designer’s signature mix of print, pattern, beading and patchwork was perfectly calibrated, especially in a series of breezy, color-infused chiffon dresses and tunics with intricately beaded necklines and the closing series of evening dresses with leafy black overbeading. Yes, there is somebody home, and it looks like he’s going to be around for a while.</p></div>"
73,spring,2003,s2003,maurizio-pecoraro,"Maurizio Pecoraro has a proven talent for delving into the romantic and folkloric, using a good deal of delicate handcraft to produce pretty, vintagey effects. But now that the peasant hordes are fast disappearing over the fashion horizon, he’s turned to a new source of inspiration: the op art ’60s.</p><p>The opening shots were all knitwear, done in bright, sporty stripes and patterns and shown with fluorescent makeup. Then came shifts, spangled with circles of sequin and paired with silver go-go boots, followed by Bridget Riley–inspired optical prints and details like appliqu¿d plastic rings. Pecoraro isn’t exactly going out on a limb, since many designers are plumbing the geometrics and plastics of the early ’60s for ideas. But it is a tough one to pull off with conviction, and the designer’s collection looked better when he reverted to the softer femininity of the silver sequin, applied to floppy chiffons, which came out at the end of his show.</p></div>"
74,spring,2003,s2003,max-mara,"What does a label known worldwide for beautiful winter coats do when the weather turns warmer? Hope for rain, of course. MaxMara based its spring collection on raincoats, making them part of a sexy-chic wardrobe that can take its following of working women through good and bad weather alike.</p><p>The show opened with a short, belted olive patent version, worn with gladiator sandals buckled around the shins. The slick mac also turned up in firefighter yellow, then became the basis of a skirt suit, in both beige and bright orange. Life isn’t all 9 to 5, though. MaxMara’s designers applied themselves to beach- and eveningwear as well. There were breezy linen-voile shirt dresses—ruched in back to give a sense of feminine form—shown over swimwear.</p><p>When it came to nightfall, the collection picked up on the ’60s trend that is bubbling all over Milan. Short, drapey jersey dresses came anchored to the body with silver-metal neck pieces straight out of the Courrèges space-age period. If a more down-to-earth dinner date is on the agenda, there was an oyster satin suit that walked the line between sensible propriety and on-trend glamour.</p></div>"
75,spring,2003,s2003,michael-kors-collection,"As much as he loves Gotham glamour, even Michael Kors needs to get out of the city once in a while. For spring, he headed to California, taking inspiration from its laid-back way of life and those casual style icons (Slim Keith, Lauren Bacall) whose sex appeal was about ease, not sleaze.</p><p>Kors paid homage to the great outdoors, Left Coast–style, via cotton piqué polo shirts, snappy little dresses (accessorized with practical, flat shoes and golf gloves) and a few bathing suits, all done in classic neutrals: khaki, navy, white, ivory. For those times when even beach bunnies have to come indoors, Kors added relaxed, knee-length jersey dresses and skirts in bands of blue-sky tones; crisp cotton tuxedo shirts worn with tailored pants; and fuzzy twinsets in bold turquoise. Lovely guipure dresses and organza skirts paired with the simplest knit tops were just right for poolside parties, with a glossy leather jacket or a supple deerskin balmacaan to ward off brisk nighttime breezes. And to pack it all up for an impromptu weekend in Lake Tahoe, Kors provided generous leather totes that fit perfectly in the trunk of the Mustang.</p></div>"
76,spring,2003,s2003,miguel-adrover,"The last couple years have been a roller-coaster ride for Miguel Adrover. The one-time media darling known for transforming humble materials into tailored tours de force became the black sheep of the industry after back-to-back seasons of Egyptian-inspired fashions that fell flat at retail. So his spring show was a make-or-break event—and Adrover more than rose to the occasion.</p><p>Titled “Citizen of the World,” the collection was inspired by the New York immigrant experience. But from look one (Omahyra wearing striped trousers and a fringed “ghetto” tank top made of do-rags), it was clear that the clothes transcended the labels (“banker,” “hasidim,” “traveler”) and themes (a tarmac-styled runway) imposed on them. The strongest looks, like a simply elegant, extra-large T-shirt dress, were gimmick-free, while Adrover’s sharkskin suits and “New Yorker” blazer were crowd-pleasing exercises in precision tailoring. For evening, the designer seemed to channel Adrian, sending out a Jean Harlow–worthy silk satin dress and a high-wattage, Swarovski-beaded gown miraculously pieced together from myriad puzzle-shaped pieces.</p><p>All this was presented to a soundtrack that morphed from takeoffs and landings to a steady heartbeat. An apt metaphor for a career that now looks to be on a straight—and resolutely individual—track.</p></div>"
77,spring,2003,s2003,missoni,"<em>Basta</em> to eclectic peasant dressing. This season, the Missoni girl has kicked off her hippie sandals and slipped on a pair of high, shiny pumps. She might be on a sexy road, but full-on wantonness is not her style. Instead she's pulled together a look that combines feminine, flirty, body-conscious pieces, like bustiers and scarf dresses, with the knits and patterns that are her true passion.</p><p>The house’s signature zigzag stitch this time came in citified trenches, pencil skirts and belted knicker suits bound with black leather. Angela Missoni used black satin to add a glam vibe to slim pants, cropped trousers and jackets, but the stars here were the vivid colors, silky stripes and cloudy pastel geometric flowers. A chiffon blouson and a knee-length drifty dress worn with a skimpy little cardigan looked simply irresistible.</p></div>"
78,spring,2003,s2003,miu-miu,"Miu Miu is the place to go for neat, unpretentious versions of whatever trends happen to be falling from the sky in a season. Right now, that means the line is awash with bright color, prints, chinoiserie, sporty clothing, goddess dresses and high hemlines.</p><p>Miuccia Prada’s knack is to bring such elements together in a fresh, offhand way. For spring, she pulled oversize sweaters on top of white shirts and paired them with Hawaiian prints made into Bermudas and caban coats; the whole look was perched atop ’70s-esque snakeskin platform shoes. A few of the shirts fastened at an angle like a cheongsam, a theme that returned at the end of the show in vibrant fuchsia and crocus-yellow crumpled satin.</p><p>The Miu Miu girl can work some athletic style into her life with wide, cropped cotton drill jackets, jersey cheerleader skirts and sawed-off sweats, making sure to flash maximum leg at all times. A few white cotton goddess dresses and bra-topped baby-dolls came down the runway, though the show's kicker was an eye-socking short coat in the brightest red satin. The collection didn't push any intellectual frontiers, but it did provide plenty of straightforward stuff to wear, and that’s just fine.</p></div>"
79,spring,2003,s2003,moschino,"The late Franco Moschino was fashion’s greatest prankster, always playing the silliest tricks on his audience to jolt them out of their seriousness. So when the models at this house decided to open the show by walking the runway backward, it was a jape that took the audience back to the old days in a very welcome way. After the laughter, though, came a lot of scribbling in notebooks, because the clothes the girls were wearing happened to be some of the youngest, perkiest, most wearable in Milan this season.</p><p>All of Italy’s major Spring fashion statements, from kimonos to prints to chiffons to layers, came down the Moschino runway. The bonus was that everything was handled with a great sense of color—pretty pastels, tiny flower prints mixed with polka dots—and without any vulgarity. Add in nippy styling ideas, like sheer apron dresses, sprinkled with sequins, to wrap over almost anything a girl owns, and the result is a design feat that merited all that happy applause.</p></div>"
80,spring,2003,s2003,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez, like several other designers, has been on a diet this past year. And as he’s slimmed, so have his clothes. The precise silhouette he’s been refining over the past few seasons has shrunk in for spring, hugging the body’s curves like a second, very elegant, skin.</p><p>The heart of the collection was a dress constructed in sections: a pencil skirt, topped by a tightly defined midriff, sometimes in crisp cotton, sometimes in sheer jersey. There were variations for day, done in black and white, with insets of taupe jersey or bits of bright color that gave the look a distinctly <em>sportif</em> feeling. Rodriguez occasionally threw on a minute jacket or Lilliputian sweater to play with the proportions, but he never strayed far from the center. There were luxe versions for nighttime, done in various kinds of silk and lightened with touches of floaty georgette. Another star of the night was a pink floor-length dress in heavy, creamy kimono silk that had the front row—Kyra Sedgwick, Julianna Margulies, a very pregnant Sarah Jessica Parker— oohing in admiration.</p><p>In lesser hands, such single-minded devotion could have been monotonous. But Rodriguez is a master of subtle invention, and the collection’s charisma never flagged.</p></div>"
81,spring,2003,s2003,oscar-de-la-renta,"Front and center at life's rich pageant—that's where Oscar de la Renta wants to be. Leaving the monochrome color schemes and workaday fabrics to others, this is a designer who deals in luxury, elegance and—always—vibrant femininity.</p><p>As with his fall collection, de la Renta worked Oriental influences into both his palette and detailing. His colors were so saturated they evoked a spice market: crimson red, saffron yellow, chocolate brown, mint green, pink and lavender. He placed an increased emphasis on accessories this season, adding everything from a pretty beaded bag to a chunky necklace to a toile print handbag in his signature football shape. The clothes were classic de la Renta silhouettes: neatly tailored trousers and shirts, smart silk shirtdresses and pretty, swingy skirts worn with linen tops. A sculpted, perfectly balanced boxy jacket made from cream-colored ottoman paid homage to Cristobal Balenciaga, while the gold matelassé pieces—particularly the ""jean"" jacket—would make a modern rajah very happy.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a de la Renta show without a ruffle or two hundred. Tightly gathered, limp and loose, stacked or single, they bore witness to this designer’s mastery of the medium. That's why the soundtrack—Nelly urging his listeners to take off all their clothes—was such a puzzle. If you're wearing de la Renta, why would you want to?</p></div>"
82,spring,2003,s2003,paul-smith,"Rock ’n’ roll softened by English quirkiness. That’s the essence of Paul Smith’s spring collection. Showing to a soundtrack of Stones and Rod Stewart oldies, the designer playfully rearranged an anthology of rock-chick classics, from a Keith Richards-esque black topcoat to leather jeans, micro shorts and vests to pointy, pink vintage bras and hoodies, strung about with punky chains.</p><p>Smith’s not really a man for the tough girls, though, and his cheeky sense of humor undercut the show’s harder edge. Never able to resist putting in a pun somewhere, he referenced his menswear background by sewing together ties to form skirts. He left his boyish tailoring raw at the edges and turned men’s formal white piqué dress shirts, complete with undone dickey bows, into dresses. When he finally indulged his nostalgic leanings by sending out tiny-rosebud and tablecloth prints, the vibe had reverted from a backstage Jack Daniels binge for the groupies to a 1950s English tea party on a summer afternoon. Isn’t Sir Paul nice?</p></div>"
83,spring,2003,s2003,peter-som,"There are clothes that look good, and then there are clothes that feel good. Peter Som, a 31-year-old designer who has logged time at Calvin Klein, Bill Blass and Michael Kors, believes those two notions are fully compatible. And his spring collection was a compelling argument in support of that belief.</p><p>Som was inspired by Jacques-Henri Lartigue's photos of the French Riviera between the wars; think romantic walks on the beach, kirs at sunset, smoky jazz clubs. Updating that ideal to suit the practical needs of the twenty-first st-century American consumer, he used sunny striped silk in slim pajama pants and blouses, black and cream canvas in squared-off jackets and Mediterranean-blue lamb suede for a luxurious slipdress. Som kept the shapes simple, adding originality via details like channel stitching, asymmetrical hems on skirts and distinctive color combinations like deep blue and chocolate brown. With one clunky exception—a series of cotton canvas gauchos—this was a collection with appeal for elegant women of any era.</p></div>"
84,spring,2003,s2003,pierrot,"A beefy male lifeguard in a tiny bikini. Pneumatic Amanda Lepore doing a slo-mo sprint down the runway in a red <em>Baywatch</em> bathing suit. Senior citizens in his-and-hers lion-print velour. Flamingos, palm trees, miniskirts and short shorts. Only the crankiest fashion editor could have made it through Pierrot’s giddy spring collection without cracking a smile.</p><p>The knitwear designer stages his shows around themes, and he chose the sunniest possible location—the beach—for his collection of crochet and jersey separates. He took classic color combinations like pink and green or red, white and blue and made them into simple shapes in girly proportions: mini kilts, shrunken tennis sweaters, cropped baseball jackets and some very cute faux-denim jackets with detailed stitching and sequins. While his silhouettes aren’t going to break any new ground (there are limits to the knit and purl, after all), the clothes have a cheerful charm that goes a long way.</p></div>"
85,spring,2003,s2003,prada,"Miuccia Prada has trained the fashion world to expect—indeed, to crave—the unexpected from her shows. Even those audience members who came dressed head to toe in her winter “sex” collection were there to see which sharp new turn she would take next. They were not to be disappointed. The designer let her fall Helmut Newton-esque fantasy evaporate in favor of something much cleaner, rearranging all her hallmarks—a love of couture fabrics, an obsession with the ’60s, and the ability to appropriate ethnic touches and play with modernist cuts—as never before.</p><p>She opened with bright, singing color: a neon-pink cheongsam shirt with an orange-sorbet short skirt, both in luxurious duchesse satin. And by accessorizing the look with sporty goggles, thrust on top of the head, and flat silver sandals, she steered well clear of any literal vintage reference. The same mind-set could be seen at work in a sequence of white T-shirt pieces decorated with patches of plastic beading, and in a pair of Bermudas cut from shiny couture-like brocade and worn with a racer-back tank. Prada reinvented jewelry, too, tying on flat leather breast pieces encrusted with plastic beads or fusing them into the necklines of bra-top jersey dresses.</p><p>The best measure of the collection’s success was that nothing was complicated, despite the complex merging of sport, color, luxury and ’60s elements. Many designers have been grasping at these disparate themes for spring, but few have been able to filter them into anything as appealingly wearable as Prada’s short satin trenches and flippy, white elastic-waist dresses.</p></div>"
86,spring,2003,s2003,rafael-lopez,"Rafael Lopez is one of the many designers who have contracted the ’70s-sporty bug that’s broken out in London. His particular strain crosses military styling with ’70s disco glam.</p><p>His opening look said it all: Erin O’Connor with glam-rock sequined eye makeup, stalking diva-like in a white parachute-silk jumpsuit and vertiginous heels. He then sent out frizzy-haired disco dollies wearing strange stripped-down T-shirts (more strip than tee, in fact), a design idea that started out in the minds of Helmut Lang and Hussein Chalayan but has suddenly morphed into the season’s sexy trend.</p><p>A lot of white jersey dresses and swishing fringe later, Lopez segued into shorty showgirl dresses. Done in lingerie pink or with swags of blue silk yarn, these seemed to derive from John Galliano’s <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> references for Christian Dior’s couture. Lopez is intent on building a retail business, but he seems a spirit divided: cool London street person or hot-blooded Latin?</p></div>"
87,spring,2003,s2003,ralph-lauren,"Some designers will tell you what their inspiration is; Ralph Lauren actually takes you there. To stage his spring show, Lauren pitched an enormous muslin-draped tent, filled with white cushions, huge candles and twinkling crystal chandeliers, in the lush walled gardens of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. Entering the building, the audience was met with trays of champagne, while the smell of tuberose and the strains of Erik Satie wafted through the evening air.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough to induce a romantic swoon, the clothes would have done the trick. Lauren loves the womanly silhouette of the fin-de-si¿cle, with its nipped waist and curving hips. For spring he chose to highlight that silhouette with regal fabrics like damask, jacquard and silk moir¿, made into curvy jackets, bustiers and vests, and shown with creamy linen or silk trousers or light, pretty skirts. There were great leather pieces, gilded or printed with a wallpaper floral, and beautiful, skin-baring silk chiffon dresses. While Lauren makes no secret of his love for the past, he’s also resolutely modern: For evening, he showed a beaded top with a floor-length bustle skirt made from very distressed blue denim.</p></div>"
88,spring,2003,s2003,rick-owens,"It's hard to believe that Rick Owens lives in the same Los Angeles that people like Sheryl Crow inhabit. His distinctly Gothic vision would appear more at home in a nice damp, dark climate—like, say, Antwerp.</p><p>Owens sometimes seems equally disconnected from the rest of the fashion community. Other designers may knuckle under, but rest assured a pencil skirt is never going to show up on his runway. And why should it? His talent is well established, and he has a loyal, bicoastal fan base happy to keep buying his soft wrapped jerseys, lightweight dresses and supple leathers.</p><p>That said, the designer’s Spring show was virtually identical to fall, except that the colors and fabrics were lighter, and both the men’s and women’s collections were presented. There are no hard edges to Owens' pieces: tailored pants and jackets are deliberately abraded and roughed-up; body-hugging dresses and skirts are fashioned from swaths of bias-cut, gossamer-light jersey; and his famous leathers are washed and crumpled. In fact, despite their lugubrious styling, Owens' pieces are sexy, beautifully made and supremely comfortable. Maybe he really is from L.A., after all.</p></div>"
89,spring,2003,s2003,roberto-cavalli,"These days, Roberto Cavalli, senior rock god of Italian fashion, has to build a stadium to contain the legions of fans who throng to witness his spectacular shows. Deservedly so. His body-enhancing, glamorous, beautifully embellished Spring collection—all chinoiserie, corsetry and exuberant print—was grandstand material par excellence.</p><p>The designer struck a right-on opening chord with a deep-blue embroidered kimono—a key trend of Milan fashion week—outrageously amplified with a raw-edged leopard-spot lining. He followed up the Asian riff with the briefest of curvy cheongsams in luscious print satin, then with dragon-painted matte leather, in lacquer red and black, cut into body-hugging, flipped-out minidresses and jeans. When he laid torso-clinching corsets over flyaway handkerchief-point print chiffon dresses over leather pants, the more-is-more decibel level reached a pitch that brought down the house.</p><p>There’s more to Cavalli, though, than pumping up the volume. The techniques he applied to his materials and cuts—like distressed, crumpled leathers and delicately pieced floor-length gowns in chiffon and lace—underscored the brashness with a grace note of quality. And that’s what makes him a maestro.</p></div>"
90,spring,2003,s2003,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret’s Spring collection was a distinct change in mood from the retro romanticism of his fall show. Mouret said his inspiration was “key British movements—the ’50s, mods and punks,” and the disheveled models had a certain morning-after air about them. Being French, though, Mouret’s version of grunge is essentially feminine, rather than down and dirty.</p><p>There were a few bondage straps and D-rings sprinkled throughout the collection, along with motorcycle and blouson jackets, and a few low-riding circle skirts. Mouret also grabbed onto a look that’s been a starting point for many of the London collections: cropped combat pants worn with heels and tank tops so shredded they barely constitute garments at all.</p><p>His strongest offerings were sexy minis with flirty box pleats, a skinny, elongated black blouson over lean pants, and fluid evening silhouettes with corseted strapless tops. Mouret is expanding into other frontiers, as well: a new jewelry line features uncut diamonds—one of which was enticingly implanted in a model’s navel.</p></div>"
91,spring,2003,s2003,ruffo-research,"The Ruffo Research collection serves two purposes: it draws attention to the experimental capabilities of one of Italy’s premier leather companies, and it acts as an incubator for young talents, who are invited to design the line in two-season stints.</p><p>For spring 2003, Haider Ackermann, a 31-year-old resident of Antwerp, Belgium, took up the Ruffo baton, previously held by fellow countrymen A.F. Vandevorst, Ve;ronique Branquinho and Raf Simons. Does Ackermann share their Belgian moodiness? Yes, but with his own angle. Like many current post-deconstructionist designers, he interprets “edge” to mean a respect for quality and elegance that can appeal to a sophisticated audience.</p><p>His instinct is to upgrade cool street clothes for grown-ups. Here, that meant track pants in a flattering cut, narrow jackets, easy dress shapes and subdued grays, brown and white. He met the Ruffo challenge by folding and weaving its suedes and leathers as if they were fabric. He turned the softest suede into sunburst-pleated skirts and poncho dresses and made slim track pants out of fine plissé skins. The best pieces were a brilliantly cut plain mushroom pinafore with a sexy racer back and a delicately pleated and perforated white skirt.</p></div>"
92,spring,2003,s2003,russell-sage,"Russell Sage opened London fashion week for spring 2003 by invoking the name of fellow Brit Charles Frederick Worth, the Victorian gentleman who set up the very first haute couture house in Paris. Seeking to restore pride in the grand, almost-lost tradition of English craftsmanship, Sage enlisted the help of centuries-old U.K. businesses, from tailors Davies &amp; Son and shirtmakers Turnbull &amp; Asser to Lobb &amp; Co. (shoes) and the Gainsborough Silk Weaving Company (brocades).</p><p>Though there’s no doubting Sage’s wish to support his country’s heritage, he seemed to be at a loss in terms of how to harness all that history. Reverting to his own background as a dealer in antique furnishing fabrics, he added fragments of precious Chinese silks, taffetas and velvets—all intrinsically beautiful in dusty, time-faded colors—to the mix. But he struggled to find a silhouette on which to pin all these marvelous materials. His conceptual thread wandered from vaguely 1960s black dresses to obis fastened with vast padded bows in back to 1950s swimsuit shapes made in brocade.</p><p>The designer’s best moment was a series of high-waisted dresses, in a rainbow of coral, pistachio, sky blue and violet, detailed with inserts of reclaimed crushed velvet. For some in the audience, though, the only place to look was forward—to his next project, the interior design of a château belonging to the cognac house Hine (a commission from LVMH). Dressing walls, windows and furniture instead of girls just might be the best use of Sage’s talents.</p></div>"
93,spring,2003,s2003,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford can take any one of dozens of nuggets of inspiration from the rich mine of Yves Saint Laurent's heritage—with a couple of caveats. First he needs to unearth something that resonates with the here and now, and second he has to forge it into something completely distinct from his work at Gucci. He did both those things for summer by dipping into Saint Laurent's pre–WW II surrealist phase.</p><p>""I think these are surreal times we're living in,"" said the designer, ""but the references are subtle."" He's right: his first look—a brown jacket with a silk rose at the bosom, paired with a coffee-colored knee-length chiffon dress—didn’t send any overt historical messages. The line of the shoulder may have been strong, but it didn't scream ""'40s"" or, for that matter, <em>Dynasty</em>-style '80s. Indeed, the muted colors, like soft lavender, champagne and coffee, and the jacket-and-soft-skirt combination seemed almost within the bounds of ladylike.</p><p>That is, until you got close enough to see the details. Some, like enamel lips and toenails on shoes, the print of a woman’s behind on the back of a skirt, and a trompe l'oeil wing pattern on an evening cloak, were relatively harmless—Dalí by way of Schiaparelli. Others, however, pushed the envelope a lot further. Ford put purple paint on the models' nipples, and cut jackets and coats like corsets, with a button planted on the tip of each breast. He also designed a black chiffon evening gown with an elongated keyhole surrounded with ruffles; framed in the opening was a small iron pendant, which, upon closer examination, turned out to be a penis.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zbgdud""></div></div><p>This, then, was a collection that let Ford have it both ways. As well as guaranteeing himself headlines with scandalizing gestures, he slipped out a lot of uncontroversial clothes, including some—a beautiful little black dress and a couple of slim-panted tuxedos—that were real gems.</p></div>"
94,spring,2003,s2003,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel may be the grande dame of Paris ready-to-wear, but she ain't no prude. Her summer collection, true to her '70s roots, was full of little sexpot knits—not to mention a few unscheduled poppings-out of bosoms.</p><p>Rykiel proved here that there's nowhere knitwear can't follow when a trend is in the offing. She did slouchy overalls on elongated straps, which were sometimes worn in an offhand way, with the bib trailing down. Lurex stripes, floppy black knit hats (worn by every girl in the show) and her signature sweaters with glittery cartoons on the front looked as neatly current as they did 30 years ago. The runway problem came, though, when the more well-endowed models bounced along in the designer's ultra-skimpy knitted bra tops. Often the tiny triangles proved not quite up to their task of containment.</p></div>"
95,spring,2003,s2003,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki is the 30-year-old designer on whom London pins its hope for the next talent who will rise up and fly internationally. What’s brought her to this point is her strong but feminine style, the coherence of her collections and her faithfulness to her cultural roots. Some see the Greek designer as the brainy blood sister of Hussein Chalayan, Nicolas Ghesquière and Helmut Lang, in terms of both her sensibility and her loner instincts.</p><p>Just as important as the girl’s intellectual credibility, though, is the fact that she has evolved a signature dress—a piece with that elusive quality that makes it stand out in a store. The Kokosalaki dress has a slightly raised waist with something intriguing and handcrafted going on in the bodice. She’s been working at it over the years, making it better and more refined—and this season much sexier—as she goes. Her killer summer frock is in whittled-away black jersey, fastened to the body by a fine spiderweb of silken chain stitch that traces a pattern on the naked skin.</p><p>That dress and close variations on it form the center of a collection inspired, the designer says, by Byzantine art—specifically dusty terra-cottas and faded teals, glowing metallic mosaics and one-dimensional images of drapery. These she translated into swirly cutouts on suede, dresses embedded with smoky Swarovski crystal and tiny mirrors, and flattened trapunto embroidery. From modern Greece, Kokosalaki took the votive tin images of hearts, babies and eyes used by Orthodox worshipers and applied them to a suede vest.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""icptm""></div></div><p>Was it a departure collection? Conceptually, no. Rather than let the pressure of attention push her into grand theatrics, Kokosalaki opted to stick to her chosen path. Which is exactly the quality of independence likely to get her there—wherever there is—in the end.</p></div>"
96,spring,2003,s2003,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney has a brand to build—and a beautiful new store to go with it. For summer, she'll be filling her shop with the kind of clothes for which she’s already known: flighty little dresses and chiffon blouses, mixed with great suits. Her departure this season was to leave aside the street-toughness of some of her former collections, replacing it with delicate washed-out color and embellished details. There was a lot more polish and softness about this show—a confident step forward for a young designer who's taking her place on the international platform.</p><p>Vintage-inspired lingerie, one of McCartney's recurring themes, was threaded through the collection. The opening bodysuit was pieced in rose satin and chiffon and worn with sage-green puffy shorts; a later jumpsuit had lace inserts running down the sides. Addicts of the designer's mannish tailoring, meanwhile, will have found her quintessential jacket done in gray-blue Prince of Wales check, matched with pants that had a lattice of open work along the outside seam.</p><p>Don't imagine Stella's quite settled down to the quiet life yet, though. For evening, she festooned gold chains onto the bodices of cutout dresses and tops, and amped up the jacket with traceries of glitter. Her hippest new idea came in the form of puffy satin bombers—she transformed one, a bright-yellow fusion of sport and chinoiserie print, into an off-the-shoulder bubble dress. McCartney is so into the glam-bomber idea, in fact, that she bounded onto the runway wearing a black version herself.</p></div>"
97,spring,2003,s2003,tommy-hilfiger,"Everybody needs a vacation, even if it's only a mental break. For his spring collection, Tommy Hilfiger packed a bag for Mustique (where he actually does own a home) and showed just how easily sportswear can travel.</p><p>Setting his sights on the twin goals of glamour and practicality, Hilfiger built his women's collection largely on silky charmeuse cargo pants and skirts in neutral tones like navy, ivory and olive. He paired those with lacy tank tops (for an afternoon of shopping) or halters and bustiers that added a bit more <em>oomph</em> (for the mai tai hour). There were flirty, swingy tiered skirts that cried out to be worn over the crochet bikinis or with a simple cotton polo, and crisp, cropped seersucker jackets guaranteed to ward off cool island breezes—even if your island is Manhattan.</p><p>Of course, no vacation is complete without some serious beach time, and Hilfiger came prepared for that, too. While the bashful might opt for a shell-printed pareu to wear over the skimpy bikinis, those looking for some attention on the lido would do well to mimic Naomi Campbell. Her undulating stroll down the runway in a navy jacket and silk bikini bottoms turned even the jaded photographers into wolf-whistling boys.</p></div>"
98,spring,2003,s2003,tyler,"Richard Tyler got his start as a tailor to the stars—rock stars, that is. The Australian-born designer spent the early part of his career stitching outfits for bands on the run, and his ability to blend that hip, sexy attitude with impeccable tailoring has made him a favorite of women who can afford his four-figure suits.</p><p>His new, lower-priced line, Tyler, is a bid to bring that <em>Almost Famous</em> chic to a larger audience. For spring, he showed cropped jackets nipped in at the waist, lightweight suits, delicate chiffon dresses and full-cut, low-slung trousers in ripply washed silk, paired with camisole tops that showed plenty of skin. While the shapes were simple, the dressmaking details that Tyler loves were abundant: pintucking and bands of ruching, embroidery and lettuce edging. And even in a line meant to be casual, Tyler can't help but revel in the subtle delights of tailoring; for example, he lined one gray silk jacket in a girly floral liberty print and added a fitting strap—the kind of thing usually found in bespoke suits—inside another.</p></div>"
99,spring,2003,s2003,valentino,"Can a lady engage in combat? Can she join up with the sports aficionados? Yes, if she's in the hands of Valentino Garavani. The Roman maestro used a Warhol camouflage print in army greens and browns for a sophisticated wardrobe of snappy short linen military jackets and coats and khaki knit jogging pants with high sandals.</p><p>A lot of designers are in the military/sports zone this season, but the ladies of the Valentino corps are hardly a casual bunch. Their day uniform can consist of an olive jacket inset with brass rings, with the belt threaded through and tied in a knot, or brown leather patterned with mother-of-pearl, or as a bronze lamé safari jacket, all just so.</p><p>For the evening review, it gets even better. Valentino's communiqués from his couture collection show up as delicate metallic-embroidered chiffons made into fragile capes, cardigans or dresses. And for the grand occasion, there's a full battalion of the designer's fabulous signature chiffon gowns.</p></div>"
100,spring,2003,s2003,vera-wang,"Eveningwear is a tough proposition; all too often, it falls into clich¿s of over-the-top glitz and heavy-duty ornament. But it doesn’t have to be that way, as Vera Wang’s beautiful spring show proved.</p><p>Gone were the Edwardian references of Wang’s dramatic, all-black fall collection. Spring’s silhouettes are simple and completely modern: knee-length straight shifts and skirts, tailored trousers and, of course, long gowns. Using a restrained palette of black, taupe and white (with just an occasional shock of vivid color like violet or red to jolt the eye) and luxurious fabrics like silk jersey, chiffon and tulle, Wang created outfits that were simultaneously elegant and youthful, hip and intelligent. She paired a simple black knit top with a whimsical skirt made from tiers of rough, ruffled ivory silk tulle, ran a line of asymmetrical ruching down the front of a strapless black cocktail dress and mixed in careful details like hand-smocking, crochet and occasional short bursts of cascading ruffles.</p><p>There was minimal embellishment, used to maximum impact. A scattering of pea-size glittering glass beads looked like dewdrops against a black pleated chiffon shift, and a pretty red floral chiffon gown had thin streams of lace tracing its seams. Wang added a few lovely daytime pieces, like a white leather coat, a cream organza skirt with a touch of ruching at the side and black wool trousers with white stitching. But her real success with this collection was injecting new life into the night.</p></div>"
101,spring,2003,s2003,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho's work is a form of passive resistance to the onslaught of questionable trends. Others see young women dressing ultrasexy for spring? Really? Branquinho, a young woman herself, simply blanks that out as she continues to explore the idea of quiet strength.</p><p>That doesn't make her a total separatist, though. Her cool form of romanticism has taken fashion's current yen for soft and silky, and run it through fluid, vaguely '40s shapes like bodice-hugging dresses and asymmetrical skirts. There's a delicacy as well to the crisscross straps in her tops or a camisole covered with silver coins.</p><p>She loves to layer—putting a dress over cuffed trousers with leggings—which could be seen as a trifle stifling when bare skin is all around. But then again, summer in Antwerp is a different animal. And where Belgians lead, others have been known to follow.</p></div>"
102,spring,2003,s2003,versace,"What’s Donatella Versace to do when the whole world seems to be going shorter, brighter and more colorful? Do it shorter, brighter, louder and, of course, better. If anyone is perfectly at ease with lime green, magenta, turquoise, yellow and pink, mind-blowing prints, and cuts that go flip-va-boom when a woman moves, it’s Donatella. All that is her birthright, and with this collection she showed the amateurs how it’s done.</p><p>When Amber Valletta came out in a hot-pink short skirt edged with grommets, the hem twelve inches above her knee, it was an iconic blast from the house’s past. But worked in fluid fabrics, the suit had a new feeling, and it was carried throughout the collection. Her brother’s influence is always present, but Donatella has her own confident point of view, which can even mean spelling out her name or adding her initials in gothic lettering on the backs of suits and dresses.</p><p>She evoked Gianni’s traditions with myriad bright, color-blocked-baby-doll and multi-print dresses, and paid him homage with grommet-studded dresses that recalled his great punk collections of the early ’90s. She took the chain mail that he loved for eveningwear and made it into hip camisoles, paired with great-looking skinny, rumpled linen combat pants.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""m95hq7""></div></div><p>Beautiful lingerie dresses were shown in the subtlest nude colors, as well as a black-lace cutout dress that looked like a second skin. The best moment, however, was when the models hit the runway in graphic, paneled cutaway swimsuits and jewel-toned satin cavalier boots. It was a parade worthy of Gianni himself.</p></div>"
103,spring,2003,s2003,versus-versace,"When a Versus junior power vixen stomps in your direction, don't get in her way. She is, after all, a girl who takes her style seriously: she's spent all afternoon locked in the bathroom pumping up her hair, painting her eyelids orange and glossing her lips the color of black vinyl. From New York to London to Tokyo and back, she's a tough girl not to be tampered with.</p><p>For spring, the Versus bad girl is into a gladiator-meets-punk frame of mind. Clashing pink and orange stripes, metallic leathers, bondage straps, shiny red slips and anything in see-through plastic are what she wants—as tight and short as possible. On her way out the door, she'll grab a bag festooned with heavy silver chains. When she heads for the beach, she'll strip down to the briefest-possible lime-green bikini—but take a multicolor-patchwork jean jacket as a cover-up. It's quite a phase she's going through. But then again, what fun!</p></div>"
104,spring,2003,s2003,viktor-rolf,"For spring, the deep-thinking Dutch conceptualists Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren threw off all somber constraints and held a wild dance party on their runway. Dizzy with prints, colors, flowers and ruffles, the show marked a wholly welcome fashion mood swing. Forget angst. Fun is the new avant-garde.</p><p>It was almost as if the designers had invited their models to turn up wearing the sort of party dresses and dinner-dance outfits their mothers might have worn in the late ’60s, that beautiful time when they were teetering on the brink between being ladylike and freaking out. Lots of the dresses, with their tiered pleats and prints, looked straight out of the heyday of Zandra Rhodes and Bill Gibb. Others seemed to pay homage to vintage Chanel, with their black piping on pink, their satin bows and their proper black lace over nude chiffon.</p><p>Viktor &amp; Rolf avoided a flop into retro, though, by adding into the mix some clever replays of their own classics, such as the immaculate tuxedo tailoring and 3-D ruffles that have become their signature. The finale dress, entirely smothered in tulle roses, brought to mind their early, arty days of couture innovation. So what put them in the mood to party? “We’ve been working on our scent, and we wanted something with strong emotion, like being intoxicated by flowers,” Horsting says. “We wanted a softer, more feminine silhouette,” Snoeren adds, “and to loosen up the strict format of fashion shows.”</p></div>"
105,spring,2003,s2003,warren-noronha,"London is not the first city you think of for sexy power dressing. Edginess yes. Shock value often. But it’s a rare British designer who keeps an appreciation of the female form at the forefront of his work. In his fourth season, Warren Noronha has emerged as just such a figure, emphasizing sexiness without ever crossing over into trashiness.</p><p>Noronha knows his way around a curve-enhancing silhouette, scooping out a neckline in a tailored wool dress or fusing a shirt to a low-cut pair of pants in a way that traces every contour. Skinny cropped pants or hip-hugging jeans look good with a strict jacket that melts into an asymmetrical peplum with a waterfall flounce.</p><p>What Noronha is best at, though, is draping jersey. As they stalked the mirrored runway, his models looked—and clearly felt—drop-dead fabulous in body-loving dresses and tops, which came in either black or an abstract print. Ditching the unnecessary theatrics of past seasons, Noronha gave his audience an unobscured view of a talent that is stepping up to the next level.</p></div>"
106,spring,2003,s2003,y-3,"For most of his lengthy and impressive career, Yohji Yamamoto has been aligned with design's avant garde: influential, admired and respected, but never what you might call a big commercial success. Then, a few years ago, footwear giant Adidas asked Yamamoto to design some sneakers. And to almost everyone's surprise, the limited edition (50,000 pairs worldwide) sold out in no time. So earlier this year, Adidas cemented its relationship with Yamamoto, naming him creative director of a new apparel division, Y-3, that the company claims has the potential to become a $300 million business.</p><p>For the label's debut collection, Yamamoto sent out men's and women's looks that focused on sober, simply cut, well-proportioned separates, all ornamented with some variation of the Adidas three-stripe logo. While these clothes might have an athletic heritage, they're not all meant for the body perfect; trousers were fluid, T-shirts and dresses grazed the body and jackets hung loosely from the shoulders. If Adidas's predictions come true, the mainstream is about to get a lot better looking.</p></div>"
107,spring,2003,s2003,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto jumped an audacious three months ahead of schedule to present his spring ready-to-wear collection the day before the Paris couture shows began. He explained the break with tradition by saying he “wanted to show in silence, with less people.” In this case, those people included Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Azzedine Alaïa, Martine Sitbon and the filmmaker Wim Wenders.</p><p>In the opulent, gilded surroundings of the Paris Opera, Yamamoto unfolded a show that was indeed couture-like—filtered through a modernist sensibility but tinged with a delicate romanticism. He began with royal-blue militaristic jumpsuits topped with army caps, some of which sprouted veils of tulle that referenced the hats of the 1950s. That made way for a parade of tailoring, always in black, which showed the designer’s fascination with discovering new volumes in empire-line jackets and coats with neat raised shoulder lines and portrait necklines. These were brought down to earth with wide pants and pointy, mannish flats.</p><p>It was Yamamoto’s eveningwear, though, that continued the designer’s career-long East-West dialogue—an obsession with the heritage of couture that dates back to a visit he made to Paris as a hungry student in the 1960s. His little black cocktail dresses, with sheer panels in front or back, flowed on the body with a tantalizing, offhand sexiness. His versions of the grand gown came as bustier dresses, sometimes with a twist in the sculpted bodice, anchored here and there with asymmetrically fastened silver chains or bone necklaces.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""b8emn""></div></div><p>On the 20th anniversary of his first Paris show, Yamamoto’s collection was both a confirmation of his stature as a grand master of design, and a testament to his restless, nonconformist questioning of the way things have to be done.</p></div>"
108,spring,2003,s2003,zac-posen,"Zac Posen is entering the make-or-break stage of his career. Is the fortunate 22-year-old just a savvy dilettante whose well-connected friends are happy to wear his offbeat clothes? Or is he truly a major talent, flowering at an enviably early age? New York is hungry for a new star, and the designer’s hype machine has been running full tilt. Produced by fashion's power-PR company, KCD, Posen's show featured hot models (including a rare appearance by Naomi Campbell) and an even hotter front row (Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore).</p><p>But onto the clothes. Posen's chosen aesthetic is ’40s Hollywood, exaggerated and punked-up. He loves to bind the female figure with sculpted strips of cloth that form angular patterns, often with a three-dimensional flourish, at the shoulders and neck. In his fall show, that treatment bordered on camp, but the designer wisely toned it down for spring. The siren dresses aimed at his fabulous friends were still in evidence, but so were soft skirts and pretty printed chiffon blouses, which were clearly meant to send a signal to all the big-league retailers sitting in the front row. Only time will tell whether the designer can continue this evolution, or whether he's a one-trick Posen.</p></div>"
1,fall,2003,f2003,alberta-ferretti,"No one can accuse Alberta Ferretti of being unfocused. Her label’s reputation, whittled down to its essence, is founded on two items: a chiffon dress and a princess coat. And those are exactly—and almost exclusively—what she showed for fall.</p><p>The chiffon dress was short, strappy and pleated. Bound under the bust and at the hip with ribbon, it was shown with opaque colored tights and high patent pumps. The coat, meanwhile, came in color-blocked patent leather and empire-line printed velvet. Ferretti stuck firmly to her chosen colors, running exhaustively through every shade and combination of dusty pink, purple, maroon and red. Toward the end she sent out a few variations in black with feathers, a fringed shimmy dress and, finally, six long versions of the chiffon gown, worn with flat satin slippers.</p><p>There’s no question that Ferretti has a firm handle on her winning signature look. It would have been all the lovelier if her show had been as short as it was sweet.</p></div>"
2,fall,2003,f2003,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Milan's fashion collections seemed to be going in two distinct directions: the warrior women, ready for a melee in their mod revival look, and the quieter types who'd prefer, frankly, to sit on the sidelines with a nice cold cocktail to keep them company. Alessandro Dell'Acqua falls resolutely into camp B, with a Fall collection full of slithery soft fabrics and pale boudoir colors.</p><p>It's not that Dell'Acqua, who also designs for La Perla, was suggesting his customer put her sex appeal on hold; he just wanted to add a little romance along the way. Chiffon tops cascaded over skintight pants, ombre-dyed ostrich feathers fluttered from the top of a halter, and minidresses were of the ruffly and unruly variety. Even when he tried to be serious and severe—as with a series of snug black separates done in satin and velvet—it came off as gently enticing. For those seeking to avoid hard edges in these tough times, Dell'Acqua's soft sell has undeniable appeal.</p></div>"
3,fall,2003,f2003,alexander-mcqueen,"A glass wind-tunnel corridor bridging a snow-covered wasteland: that was the bleak techno-meets-nature setting for Alexander McQueen’s mind trip for fall. “I wanted it to be like a nomadic journey across the tundra,” he said. “A big, desolate space, so that nothing would distract from the work.”</p><p>The clothes, sculpted into his signature nip-waisted, stiff A-line skirt silhouettes, exhibited all the intense craft and some of the shapes that he learned during his stint at Givenchy couture. It bumped his ready-to-wear up to a new level, and if the plot—which traveled through Eurasian ethnic into punk and on to motocross—wasn’t all that understandable, the decorative impact made up for it.</p><p>Fantastic details were lavished on dramatic structured carapaces, embroidered, painted and mind-blowingly embellished to look like antique samurai armor, Russian lacquered dolls and tribal ceremonial dress. Somewhere along the line, the stiff pleated skirts segued into molded suits, done in jigsaws of two-tone checkerboard—the better to show off the designer’s devilishly accurate cutting skills.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""b8vorh""></div></div><p>McQueen can’t resist some theatrics: he sent two models into the wind tunnel, one wearing a skintight leather suit harnessed to a billowing parachute, the other dragging a 20-foot kimono into the eye of the fake snowstorm. Still, the moments that made the audience catch its breath were those that betrayed McQueen’s softer, more romantic side. One was a jacket constructed of white tulle pom-poms that looked like a bubble of snowballs. The other was the prettiest dress in the show: pale gray chiffon cut in an empire shape, embroidered with sequins and worn by Natalia Vodianova with the brightest red ruched over-the-knee boots.</p></div>"
4,fall,2003,f2003,ann-demeulemeester,"On the surface of it, there’s not much change from Ann Demeulemeester for fall. Everything is still black with that lanky, tape-dangling, boot-stomping slouch about it. Demuelemeester’s not about to break into vivid color, crystal strewing or ’60s Cardin references. But then again, who’d want her to?</p><p>Her strong point of view doesn’t necessarily make her a fashion refusenik. Under cover of all that darkness she’s dealing with the main points of the season in her own way. There are skinny pants laced up the leg, which parallel Christian Dior and Helmut Lang, but she cuts them rocker-style in matte oiled cotton. Fashion’s gone layer crazy for fall, and that’s exactly Demeulemeester's thing. No one knows better how to make a cool assemblage of matte gauze T-shirt dresses, leather leggings, distressed biker jackets, satin hip wraps and pieces of tied-on tailoring seem as if it just happened.</p><p>The designer has her own dialogue with the subject of menswear-for-women, too. With their black fedoras, big jackets, pants, shirts and ties done in matte crepe, the models looked like Annie Hall’s goth sisters. The collection didn’t flaunt its familiarity with the trends, but that’s precisely Demeulemeester’s appeal: right-on style by stealth, season after season.</p></div>"
5,fall,2003,f2003,anna-molinari,"Anna Molinari is one of Italy’s suppliers of twentysomething style, a collection that typically picks up on vintage ideas and tweaks them to suit the current mood—but always with a Latin nod toward sexy femininity. No prizes, then, for guessing that the ’60s were the starting point for Rossella Tarabini, the line’s designer (and daughter of its eponymous owner).</p><p>Tarabini took Jane Birkin as inspiration for the collection, which began with an image of a girl in a short, black bouclé Empire coat, banded in fur and worn with high-heeled Mary Janes and thick black stockings. Innocent? Not really. As she moved, she showed a wicked flash of thigh, playing sweet against knowing—and that was the show’s theme in a nutshell. Dresses made from slight, fragile fabrics were worn layered or showed up as a fluttery frill under long, skinny ribbed knits.</p><p>Tarabini dipped into the faded, barely there hues—fugitive shades of lilac, beige and champagne—that are turning up as Milanese favorites. Her structured daywear centered on peacoats and shorts, cropped sailor pants and little fur jackets. For evening, she picked out a ribbon-and-bow motif in diamanté on a charmeuse trapeze, which looked pretty, but then she sent out endless variations on tiered shimmy dresses, which pushed the collection just a fringe too far.</p></div>"
6,fall,2003,f2003,anna-sui,"A veteran flea-market scavenger, Anna Sui is a mixmaster who gives equal weight to thrift-store treasures and fine antiques. The same holds true for her collections, where she tosses decades and movements together with gusto.</p><p>While many designers have zeroed in on the mid-’60s mod aesthetic this season, Sui focused instead on the end of that decade, specifically the London boutique Biba and its art deco motifs and girlish, narrow-cut fashions. She sent out sweet little dresses in lace or printed chiffon with fluttery handkerchief hems, body-hugging cardigans, slim harlequin-pattern jerseys, and popcorn-knit sweaters in muted plums, browns and greens. But like a juggler itching for a challenge, Sui upped the ante by tossing in another decade—the ’70s, which showed up in patchwork quilted parkas, anoraks and a group of ski pants paired (confusingly) with beaded chiffon tops. It was a lot to handle, but Sui is a confident fashion deejay, and in her hands it all became cheerful, noisy fun.</p></div>"
7,fall,2003,f2003,anne-klein,"Anne Klein designer Charles Nolan picked up the early-’60s mood that’s been sweeping through the collections this week, citing references from Jackie Kennedy to Antonioni to the house’s own founding designer.</p><p>For one thing, that meant hemlines zoomed well above the knee; fully three quarters of the looks Nolan sent out were minis, from swingy kilts to leather A-line looks to sporty, rugby-striped versions. He paired them with slim ribbed turtlenecks, popcorn-bedecked sweaters, crisp shirts and silky geometric-print blouses. There were a few pantsuits with trim, short jackets topping slim, tab-waisted trousers. While minis are generally aimed at the younger set, Nolan’s restrained colors made the collection mature: plummy browns, black, ivory, white, navy and gray, with jolts of orange and blue. And he made sure to give his grown-up customer a bit of luxe, via combinations like a black mink anorak worn over a black leather mini.</p><p>For evening, Nolan moved his inspiration back even farther, to the flapper era. He showed short, beaded and sequined shifts, one topped with a pretty ivory satin evening coat. How short his customer will really go, of course, remains to be seen. But should she decide to raise high her hemlines, Anne Klein gives her an adult alternative.</p></div>"
8,fall,2003,f2003,badgley-mischka,"Mark Badgley and James Mischka keep alive the tradition of occasion dressing, designing entrance-making gowns for red carpets and gala benefits. Their shows are more about variations on a theme than about surprise, and they stayed true to form for fall, with a palette out of a wine-lover’s dream. Beaded and satin dresses, both short and long, came in colors like claret, bordeaux, cognac, plum, rose and lilac. A deco style was much in evidence, most successfully in the sliplike satin gown worn by Eva Herzigova to close the proceedings. Badgley Mischka also scored with the ""plucked"" mink coats and jackets that appeared throughout, though it's probably best to leave the lamé leg warmers at home.</p></div>"
9,fall,2003,f2003,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière decided to show his fall collection in New York rather than his home base of Paris. And given the terror alerts, bloodless economy, looming war and frigid winter the city is enduring, the timing for his broody, sexy presentation couldn’t have been better. Ghesquière held the show in a severely minimalist art gallery (with an audience that included two of Hollywood’s darker starlets, Chloë Sevigny and Asia Argento), the better to focus attention on the intriguing shapes, fabrics and colors.</p><p>There aren’t many who play as fearlessly with proportion as Ghesquière, and in this collection he staked out two strong silhouettes: First came slim trapeze looks, like a spare black tunic coat over white leggings and a pretty mint-colored sweater; then he sent out a modern hourglass, made by way of jackets and tops cut with balloon sleeves and often cropped at midtorso. Worn over skintight pants or derrière-hugging minis (including one witty version that looked like a kilt caught in a wind tunnel), it was sleek, tough and cleverly sexy—the kind of uniform a secret agent might wear in <em>Matrix: Reloaded.</em></p><p>The designer’s fabrics, substantial and with surface interest, demanded their own attention: chunky shearling, nubby wool felt, ribbed jersey and slick nylon. Chiffon turned up in a few evanescent pink and white tops, sewn with meandering ruffles and brought down to earth by glossy gray thigh boots. Ghesquière excels at pushing his medium to its limit, as shown in the variations he did on his beloved patchwork pieces. But he’s also a master of the classics who can toss off a perfectly cut black blazer to take its wearer through any crisis in style.</p></div>"
10,fall,2003,f2003,bcbg-max-azria,"Who is the BCBG girl? For the past few seasons her identity has been murky at best, but this season she seems to have hit her stride. Music maven Michael Gaubert hinted that ""she's groovy"" when he opened the show with White Sport's song of the same name, and Max Azria's clothes lived up the soundtrack. Curbing his enthusiasm for chiffon in favor of canvas, corduroy and cotton twill, Azria showed a series of solid, workwear-inspired jackets and coats with interesting pockets and decorative studs. These smart basics were shown with more romantic and, yes, floaty, blouses and dresses, some of which referenced the ’30s by way of the disco ’70s.</p><p>Who is the BCBG girl? She's young and yes, this season she's even a bit groovy.</p></div>"
11,fall,2003,f2003,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour’s fall show was full of self-conscious references—to everything from sewing patterns to dressmaking dummies—that only a fashion insider could recognize. But even the most casual observer will appreciate the collection’s subtle charm and clean cuts.</p><p>Sarafpour sent out elegant little dresses and jackets whose brass zippers were intentionally left uncovered as decoration, and a camel coat with the darts and shoulder pads picked out in black. She also picked up on the retro trend flowing through this season, exploring a late-’50s feel via coats and jackets with three-quarter sleeves worn over slim skirts or toreador pants. This is a designer with a witty sense of scale—and who knows when to use it. Last season, for example, she played with exploding sunburst tie-dye; this time, it was fox-fur collars the size of kiddie pools and lacy sweaters crocheted in extra-bulky ivory yarn.</p><p>The gold brocade the designer used for a few skirts and tops has shown up on too many other runways to look new, but Sarafpour’s disciplined cutting made it simple and appealing. And if some of her pieces were a little overworked—like a tulle ball skirt topped by a beige horsehair bodice—the collection as a whole had an appealing sense of gentle, intelligent experimentation.</p></div>"
12,fall,2003,f2003,betsey-johnson,"A little bubblegum, a little bondage, a lot of cheerfully trashy clothes—yes, Betsey Johnson is back. After an extended break following her 60th birthday last summer, the designer has banished all thoughts of retirement and instead redoubled her efforts, launching a new line called Betseyville.</p><p>Johnson recently bought a vacation house in Mexico, and fiesta is clearly on her mind. She opened the show by sending out a group of twirling models wearing sweeping tiered skirts and tiny tourist T-shirts, and she followed these with another 80 or so outfits that ranged from biker looks to first-communion dresses. Showing women's and men's wear and both her lines (Betseyville is primarily denims and T-shirts) in a color palette that could only be described as kaleidoscopic, Johnson offered up something for good-humored consumers of every stripe. Granted, not every girl will be able to wear the bikini top no bigger than a headband, or the teeny denim minis, but a flowery crocheted sweater or a floaty chiffon dress will certainly bring a breath of fresh air to a moribund closet. Among the best pieces: crocheted sweaters, skinny cigarette jeans, chevron-striped sweater dresses and the aforementioned chiffons.</p></div>"
13,fall,2003,f2003,bill-blass,"Lars Nilsson continues to put his imprint on the house of Bill Blass, merging his own intellectual and artistic impulses with the spirit of one of America’s most influential design names.</p><p>In the two years since Nilsson became the house’s creative director, he’s made it clear that he loves sophisticated color combinations and traditional handcrafts, using them to give new life to the elegant sportswear that Blass’s customer craves. For fall, he put some dazzling hues on the runway, starting with a group of piney-green separates that included a dyed sable coat. He sent out a scarlet satin shirt and wool skirt that radiated its own heat and a creamy ivory jacket cut like a duffel coat worn over honey-colored suede trousers. The handwork showed up on an inky blue coat, embroidered with silver and worn over a navy satin skirt and black cashmere sweater.</p><p>Nilsson showed a few looks that echoed the founder's delight in irreverent juxtapositions: a motorcycle jacket cut in black satin, for example, or a simple hip-length sweater worn with a chiffon and lamé skirt for an easy nighttime look. There were prime examples, too, of the American designer tradition that sees no shame in luxurious practicality; a black cotton twill parka with a black sable hood, for example, or a navy velvet jacket that works for daytime or as an evening piece.</p></div>"
14,fall,2003,f2003,blaak,"With a sudden <em>kerranng!</em> of heavy-metal energy, Blaak woke up the London scene with a show that proved that not all young Brit designers are sleepwalking back to the ’60s. Stomping out in a gray denim flying suit with punky black-banded zones of cross-laced tapes running up and down her body, Blaak’s first model struck a rebel pose, and the collection was on a roll.</p><p>Designers Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif picked up the sport/utilty track where they left it off last season, but zipped up the action with some rock-star attitude for a collection called Electric Collision. They used contrasting washed-satin and mesh fabrics, chemical-dyed denim and metallic-shot silk to give the aviator look a streetwise workout. Best of all—in a season when many have played it safe with black—they kept the faith with color, using shades of raspberry, turquoise, royal blue and silver. When Okada described the theme of the show as “cosmonauts meet crusaders,” it didn’t illuminate much; but the idea of designing for “a strong woman” hit a refreshing note in a London season that has often seemed to equate youth with passivity.</p></div>"
15,fall,2003,f2003,boudicca,"Extraordinary cut. Dramatic silhouettes. The sound of an audience bursting into spontaneous applause after an atmospheric build-up. Sounds like the good old London we used to know. It took Boudicca, the reclusive East End–based duo, to stir up the city to a level of excitement that’s been mourned since Alexander McQueen departed for Paris. Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby’s collection, crafted entirely in black with the exception of one dress, was a beautifully considered sequence of darkly feminine glamour, with extra sparkle provided by the original use of Swarovski crystals.</p><p>Boudicca is not an overnight student phenomenon, and that’s a good thing. Shaking off a five-season reputation for cryptic presentations in dank venues, Broach and Kirkby seized their debut appearance in the official British Fashion Council tent as an opportunity to hold their talent up to the light for the first time. What was revealed had an accomplished, distinctive, sometimes couture-like quality that showed through in striking lace dresses, taffeta skirts with deep knife-pleat flounces, slithery asymmetric jersey, deluxe blousons and puffy down jackets.</p><p>The detailing showed all the ingenuity and skill of a couple who have devoted years to questioning and refining their vision. Dresses often came overlaid with lace tied on like an apron; skirts were crisscrossed with ribbon in back or exploded at the hem with extravagant godets, one decorated with giant black silk roses. Amid all the layers of black, the models’ limbs and faces were adorned with crystal transfers, an effect building to a finale of a girl who appeared in a sparkling silver jacket and headpiece. And that was when Boudicca won the London season’s first ovation.</p></div>"
16,fall,2003,f2003,burberry-prorsum,"At the age of 30, Christopher Bailey is the creative director of one of the largest and most broadly based fashion brands in the world. He shoulders the responsibility for making Burberry’s many product lines both cool enough for hipsters and classic enough for conservatives, a balancing act that he carries out with almost preternatural maturity. Yet his being only 30 may explain why his Fall collection for Burberry Prorsum, the house’s designer collection, was shot through with flashbacks to the 1980s. He is, after all, a child of that decade.</p><p>Bailey wisely dispensed with forced references to the Burberry plaid (been there, done that) while making rainwear a link through the show. A printed nylon mac was humorously patterned with an English country scene—including a cartoon of the Burberry horseman logo—which, he said, had been drawn up in the studio. The label’s weatherproof reputation was preserved, thanks to an acid-yellow parka, a slick black rain poncho and matte-black leather trenches, accessorized with bright bags featuring flaps to contain matching umbrellas.</p><p>The ’80s references came via searing shots of color—leaf green, mint, royal blue, apricot and yellow—and a penchant for jersey leggings. There were plenty of the neat little jackets, in washed cottons and puffy leather, that Bailey does so well. He also layered on raw-edged, crinkled stretch-chiffon wrap dresses, and he came up with some cool sweaters in contrasting blocks of New Age stripes. After that, it got a bit puzzling.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""r1ithh""></div></div><p>Why the strange cuts with the raised, inside-out seaming? And why not some more stuff for the grown-ups? Overall, the collection did not come off as fully resolved. On the other hand, Bailey’s heart is in the right place. After the show, he said he “wanted energy, color, something to make people feel better.” And we can all relate to that.</p></div>"
17,fall,2003,f2003,calvin-klein-collection,"It seemed like just another pre-show melee at Calvin Klein’s Friday afternoon presentation: packs of photographers jostling to get shots of Hilary Swank, Renée Zellweger and Clare Danes as editors and retailers milled sociably. But in fact there was a sea change taking place: That day, the designer officially closed the $430 million deal to sell the company he and partner Barry Schwartz started 35 years ago to Philips-Van Heusen. Klein claims he’s going to help the new owners build his name into a billion-dollar megabrand—but that’s a world of shoe and underwear licenses, not designer sportswear. And whether he’ll still have the appetite to do a collection every six months remains to be seen.</p><p>His fall collection read like a mixed reaction. There were classic Klein touches—that gracefully minimalist cut, in perfectly fitting slim trousers and neat wool flannel jackets with firmly squared-off shoulders and whip-thin leather belts. He showed plenty of dresses, many sleeveless and cut with a flirty little flounce just above the knee. And as might be expected from a man who started as a coat designer, there was good-looking outerwear: a boxy wool bouclé style, a black shearling baseball jacket as plush as a teddy bear, sleek black leathers and supple cashmeres. But there were elements that didn’t compute, like an odd red-green-gold abstract print, poufy bubble skirts and—given his obvious appeal to the Hollywood contingent—a disappointing absence of the glamorously simple eveningwear he’s offered up in the past.</p></div>"
18,fall,2003,f2003,capucci,"The idea of a grand, retired, old-world Roman couturier collaborating with a wayward young tyke of the Belgian school may sound like a scheme from the far realms of fashion improbability. But as of this season it’s a reality. The Capucci collection, launched for Fall in Milan, is a start-up project that has brought in Bernhard Willhelm to reinterpret the work of the label’s revered founder, Roberto Capucci.</p><p>The difference between this and many another revival of a defunct fashion house is that Capucci is alive, spry and actively involved in the enterprise at the age of 74. Another twist is that Willhelm is only the first of the young designers who will be involved; next season his contributions will be shown alongside those of Tara Subkoff, of Imitation of Christ, and the Spanish designer Sybilla.</p><p>Never a conformist to the fashion system, Capucci had a reputation as a genius sculptor of fabric who showed his collections not according to the season but when the inspiration moved him. Backed by the heavyweight Italian fashion industrialists Franco Bruccoleri, Franco Pene and Aldo Palmeri, he’s now aiming to introduce a new generation to his name and legacy. “The world changes. There are no more balls or women who can come for five fittings for a dress,” he says. “This is a new adventure. I want to see how young designers could carry on the spirit of what I do with a new attitude.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""1rqchj""></div></div><p>After being invited by Capucci to immerse himself in the house’s archive of 30,000 designs, Willhelm emerged with the core of a small collection that merges street fashion and couture construction. Head-turning items included a gargantuan down parka with vast, puffy leg-of-mutton sleeves and a gray bat-winged sweatshirt cardigan that falls into tails at the back. It looked like the intriguing start of a project that will get into full swing next season. Watch this space.</p></div>"
19,fall,2003,f2003,carolina-herrera,"In an era when sex appeal seems mostly to be about big displays of flash and flesh, Carolina Herrera sent out a coolly appealing collection that made a case for subtly seductive elegance.</p><p>Satin is one of the season’s most important fabrics, and Herrera’s were some of the most beautiful so far—mouth-watering, fluid blouses and skirts in richly pigmented blues, burgundy, gray and creamy white. She paired those pieces with slim pencil skirts and tailored trousers and topped some with buttery, light Persian lamb coats and jackets or swingy sables. Elegantly tailored suits and coats never got too serious, thanks to a body-hugging cut and soft colors like dove gray or toffee.</p><p>The Herrera woman has a packed social schedule, of course, which calls for a few evening looks. If she's feeling flirty, she'll grab one of the designer’s bouncy ball skirts edged in feathers. Would-be sirens, meanwhile, will find that her slinky, body-skimming gowns flatter both their assets and their intelligence.</p></div>"
20,fall,2003,f2003,celine,"Wondering where the wild things are? The answer, at least this season, is on the runway at Celine.</p><p>Michael Kors showed sequined zebra-striped bustier dresses, giraffe spots on pony bags, silver crocodile miniskirts and jackets, mink boleros and dramatic over-the-ear bonnets in Saga fox fur. But if the prints and pelts were straight out of the wilderness, the collection was most definitely designed for the urban jungle. The silhouette was neat, slim and dangerously short, while the palette was almost entirely black and white, with plenty of Chrysler Building-at-sunset sparkle. The clothes had a tough big-city-after-dark edge, with sharp silver zippers snaking their way up the back of second-skin pants, chains hanging from otherwise ladylike structured handbags, and white leather coats shot through with grommets.</p><p>Has the Celine woman morphed into Debbie Harry circa 1981? Most definitely not. This was punk done for girls with clean hair and Birkin bags—the same sort of women who will appreciate Kors’s swingy <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em> satin trench coats and ice-blue fox puffer jackets.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""yo0a79""></div></div><p>The uptown/downtown clash could be seen most clearly in the shoes: sky-high square-toe stilettos with oversize silver Pilgrim buckles, which Kors described as “ladylike from the front and nasty from the back.” “It’s all about contradiction,” he said of the collection. “It’s a good girl gone bad or a bad girl gone good. I’m still trying to figure out which.”</p></div>"
21,fall,2003,f2003,chalayan,"Is it possible that Hussein Chalayan is thinking the same way everyone else is? For fall he showed small, drapey cutaway dresses; skinny, skinny pants; and some great utility/patchwork jackets and coats, decorated with embroidery and zippers. Add in a miniskirt with D-ring garter tabs, glove-leather formfitting dresses and high heels, and the descriptions begin to read like a roundup of the season’s most important fashion headlines.</p><p>As always, though, the genius is in the execution. Chalayan came at these ideas from his own distinctive direction, elevating the collection above mere trendiness. For several seasons he’s been influential in cutting abstract layers into clothing and superimposing elements of ethnicwear onto urban materials. Now all that experimentalism has come together to form cool, downright wantable stuff. Dresses, jackets and coats came with pieced-in jigsaws of plaid, zones of military drab, the odd patch of shearling and fragments of olive branch–patterned embroideries derived from Turkish folk costume. Sound complicated? It wasn’t. “It looks much less conceptual,” beamed Julie Gilhart, fashion director of Barneys New York, after the show. “The jackets and miniskirts are great.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the burden of Chalayan’s allusions is impossible to ignore. His complex performance-art presentation plumbed the foreboding imagery of religious guilt and impending war but ended with a group of girls popping open inflatable pockets as they stood next to a wooden boatlike installation. The designer said it symbolized Noah’s Ark: hope for humanity after the deluge.</p></div>"
22,fall,2003,f2003,chanel,"For fall, Karl Lagerfeld showed graphic, rechopped teeny-weeny Chanel suits that, he said, were inspired by the work of Russian constructivist painter Kasimir Malevich. Girls won’t need an art-history class to get the idea, though: it’s all about a short double-layered A-line skirt (no longer than fingertip length), a minute tight-sleeved shrunken jacket, black blocked against white and a whole lot of funky leg action.</p><p>Starting from that basis, Lagerfeld mixed things up with his usual polymath flair. The addition of slick black leather leg warmers and gauntlets meant the suit came over a bit biker chic; with white boots, it said space-age; and when he let a little lace peep from the pelmet, the tiny two-piece looked fully in touch with fall’s pretty femininity.</p><p>The decorative vibe ran through the collection: purple tweed was edged with ruffles, a pastel suit was outlined with furry loops of wool, and tougher plaited leather pieces were connected with fragile zones of tulle. Details took the form of white rabbit-fur collars embedded with white jet, oversize silver chains studded with porcelain beads, high boots and a slew of puns on the tools of the trade—exposed zippers, necklaces made of huge snaps, and spirals of hooks and eyes winding around dresses.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""phk0nj""></div></div><p>In the middle of all this, Lagerfeld staged a ski moment for the house's entire family, sending out Pat Cleveland with her children, Anna and Noel Van Ravenstein, in double-C down jackets and boots. In other words, all the usual playfulness of Chanel ready-to-wear was there, done with a light-handed touch that underscored Coco's legacy of flexibility—and fun— in the reign of King Karl.</p></div>"
23,fall,2003,f2003,chloe,"Chloé may be celebrating her 45th birthday, but she looks about 27 with London girl Phoebe Philo in charge. Philo projects her own mixed-up vintage-meets-sexy-streetwear look onto the clothes, which is fine as long as she polishes things up to the Paris mark. Never one to wax philosophical about the fun of getting dressed, the designer uttered nothing more about the collection than: ""What can I say? It was a little bit of everything I love doing thrown in there.""</p><p>Thrown in there was exactly right. What Philo appears to be loving right now included cascading ruffly chiffon, Zandra Rhodes-style; Alaïa-ish short black flounce skirts; bad-taste eighties animal-print poncho dresses; thick, orange woolly tights; and suede thigh boots. That's not to say that she didn't send plenty of the house classics down the runway, too. There were soft frocks (the staple on which Chloé built its reputation in the sixties and seventies), in a poppy print with a tie-back waistline, and a flippy two-tiered skirt. The classic girl-about-town navy coat came styled with a hoodie underneath, and jeans (unseen here since Stella McCartney moved on) made a comeback, skintight and with poppies appliquéd to the derriere and other strategic spots. A military shirt sleekly tucked into well-cut matching pants inspired a round of applause.</p><p>What was missing , though, was the coherence of Philo's first few outings at Chloé. There was no graspable theme, as in Brigitte Bardot in Saint-Tropez and Keith Richards at Altamont of earlier seasons. It's not that fashion needs a narrative to be interesting, but a strand of identifying, connecting thought is what helps lift things above the level of nice clothes on a rack.</p></div>"
24,fall,2003,f2003,christian-dior,"Only one man on earth could possibly whip up a collection of fetish queens in Kabuki face paint, going crazy in multicolor Asian-slash-eighteenth-century clothes. Hello, John Galliano! Up to his canny method madness at Christian Dior yet again.</p><p>“It was hard-core romance! Sex robots!” was the sound bite Galliano delivered backstage to describe his ready-to-wear version of the conceptual mayhem he wreaked at Dior’s couture collection in January. Back then he’d just come back from a trip to China and Japan, scandalizing many critics with the extra-outsize scale of his box-shaped, 3-D cutting experiments and mind-blowing kaleidoscope of East-West references.</p><p>But now we see how it all trickles down to the level of wearable, wantable clothes. Take a pink, crystal-embroidered duchesse-satin coat, extravagantly ruffled with layers of organza, or a fragile chiffon dress patterned in mint, yellow and magenta—who wouldn’t? Rubber leggings, cross-laced up the front, came with a peach-colored, gold-embroidered satin jacket, edged with a multilayer explosion of organza ruffles. A massive fur in three shades of lilac rode on a tiny, slinky minidress. The stripes and numbers of football jerseys got thrown onto wispy chiffon; the black-and-white fish prints from Chinese kites were dramatized into voluminous gowns. This was a collection studded with innumerable delicate, richly beautiful pieces.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""iirvsm""></div></div><p>Above all, the wearability factor is proven by Dior’s results. For those turned on by financials, the house just announced operating profits of $36 million for the last season. Meanwhile, Galliano fanatic Gwen Stefani displayed her own enthusiasm for the Dior bottom line. “Just how do I get my ass into that rubber skirt?” she wanted to know.</p></div>"
25,fall,2003,f2003,clements-ribeiro,"Showing in their hometown for the first time since September 2001, Clements Ribeiro was warmly welcomed back to London as a small sign that Paris is not, perhaps, the absolute pinnacle of designer ambition. They made their comeback, however, whistling a Frenchified tune, inspired by Jane Birkin and the inevitable ’60s. That meant an opening of a little cream jumper dress over a gray turtleneck, a princess-line tweed coat and an oversize striped cashmere sweater masquerading as a dress. Clearly, the <em>jeune-fille</em> Parisian mood of their Cacharel consultancy has left its mark.</p><p>Suzanne Clements said that the duo’s decision to show in Paris had been a purely pragmatic move—to get seen in the season of the 9/11 crisis—and that the reason for their return was to give her and her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, more time between staging their own presentation and the Cacharel collection. The trouble is that, as fashion moves on at its breakneck pace, you don’t ever get to go back to where you started from.</p><p>Clements Ribeiro shone at the moment when cashmere knitwear was reborn as a fashion vehicle. Their infinitely varied striped or wittily patterned sweaters virtually redefined the category, beginning a worldwide economic cycle that peaked at the turn of the millennium. Wisely, they are still turning out the knits that made their name, in pale pastel patterns and variously banded stripes, but it’s hard to recapture the original excitement. Instead, the pair concentrated on Bermuda-shorts suits, swirly multicolor prints and high-waisted A-line frocks and coats. It went with the flow of the trend nicely enough, but it didn’t chart any new territory.</p></div>"
26,fall,2003,f2003,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo is a lone traveler on an aesthetic journey, during which she occasionally throws out oblique reflections on the state of the world. For Fall, Kawakubo sees her woman quite literally as a person in transit, walking toward her destination with what look like bundles of possessions slung about her body. In one sense, the designer arrived at those tied-on fabric slings and knapsacks by developing the bunchy forms that were knotted into her Spring collection. Now, though, they’ve acquired different associations, which, Kawakubo said, emerged from the idea of a pilgrimage.</p><p>Oddly enough, that idea didn’t send her collection wandering too far off the beaten track. Returning to work with her beloved tartans, Kawakubo created jackets and pantsuits that addressed the subject of traditional menswear from a different angle. Platform-soled loafers had the rock-and-roll cool of brothel creepers, while molded rubber Wellingtons had the air of biker boots about them.</p><p>Kawakubo doesn’t usually spell out her political beliefs, but this collection included a section of printed fabrics bearing slogans standing up for individualistic thinking. One was Kierkegaard’s “The majority is always wrong,” supplemented by a couple of one-liners written by the designer’s collaborator Gene Krell: “Conformity is the language of corruption” and “Viva the one-percenters.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""uhblo""></div></div><p>The last pilgrim exited the show wrapped in a flaglike cloak, pieced together in the form of a black cross. Though Kawakubo said the religious symbolism was coincidental, the image was disturbingly poignant.</p></div>"
27,fall,2003,f2003,costume-national,"Sleek, dark, graphic, sexy. For Fall 2003, Costume National designer Ennio Capasa did more of what he does best. Sensual silk dresses slunk their way down the models’ shoulders as they walked. Curve-hugging overcoats featured kinky corset bones and lingerie lacing. Skirts and dresses were short enough to cause serious gawking, if not a Fifth Avenue fender bender. Capasa’s love for noir was much in evidence—there was black leather, ebony jersey, deep-charcoal jacquard, and midnight mink—but shots of Easter-candy violet and deep peony pink provided welcome points of light.</p><p>At its strongest, the collection, which Capasa named “Digital Beauty,” gives modern urban women more of what they need (or, at least, want)—slim jackets, A-line skirts, printed dresses, great black pants. But at times the clothes crossed the line from chic and modern to futuristic and far-fetched. Stretch-leather jumpsuits, which fit like a latex glove, are perhaps best left to actual digital beauties like <em>Tomb Raider</em>’s Lara Croft.</p></div>"
28,fall,2003,f2003,d-g,"Important client lunch? Electroclash rave? Eighties night down at the local dive bar? D&amp;G has them all covered, with a far-reaching collection that mixes the brash sexiness of its parent and its own youthful verve.</p><p>For its fall show, D&amp;G brought in British DJ Princess Superstar and planted her, turntables and all, in the middle of the runway. It must have felt just like another night in the club, as troops of women and men streamed past her in outfits ranging from absolutely-proper business wear (slim, sexy dresses with jackets, pantsuits, crisp shirts) to New Romantic/punk combinations—huge, dripping-off-the-shoulder blouses, miniskirts and pants so tight they should be reclassified as hosiery. The rollicking neo-Edwardian and pirate-y looks recalled Vivienne Westwood's outfits for Adam Ant, while graffiti-printed neon-bright pieces seemed to be desperately looking for someone named Susan. It was a cheerful, fast-paced look at the closet of a woman whose motto could be ""life's a VIP list and I'm on it.""</p></div>"
29,fall,2003,f2003,diane-von-furstenberg,"The Bond girl is a touchstone of twentieth-century fashion, outlasting momentary trends and providing a beacon of sexy stylishness that shines across the decades. For fall, Diane von Furstenberg and her creative director, Nathan Jenden, took this pop-culture icon as their departure point, creating a wardrobe equally suited to seducing spies, battling criminal masterminds or sipping cocktails at sunset.</p><p>The presentation began with von Furstenberg's own icon—the wrap jersey dress—rethought in a shorter, asymmetrical cut. Then came simple pantsuits, filmy printed chiffons and slithery evening dresses with plunging necklines. Intriguingly mismatched color combinations—peach with rust, pink with brown and blue—gave the show a distinctly '70s flavor, while the breadth of the collection means Bondettes of all stripes will find something to suit them. Daredevils will go for the giddy peacock-blue velvet minidress; double agents will slip by in the ladylike white flannel coat; and undercover types will cozy up to the rainbow-hued fringed sweater worn over skintight jeans.</p></div>"
30,fall,2003,f2003,dkny,"Schoolgirls and career women, preppies and punks, party girls and artsy types—they all converged on the runway at DKNY, where Donna Karan aimed to reflect the sidewalk society of her beloved New York City.</p><p>Of course, Karan’s sidewalks are undeniably better-dressed than most. Her schoolgirl uniform, for example, is a neat fitted navy jacket over a crisp white shirt and flirty grey flannel skirt short enough to shock a nun. And the world would be a prettier place if more 9-to-5 types wore some of Karan's lovely, colorful outerwear, like the scarlet wool zipped coat or the soft, honey-colored mohair version. Even the downtown crowd that calls its own style shots could benefit from a pair of skinny black pants with just enough zippers to be hip (but not enough to be scary), or her black sweater with its chain-mail sleeves. There were plenty of other easily approachable items, like skinny Glen-plaid pants, black tuxedo jackets, fuzzy mohair sweaters and silky little skirts. Part of the delight came from the pretty, atypical fall colors—mint green, hot pink, gold, lavender, red—that made the collection distinct and different.</p><p>Karan uses the DKNY line almost as a sketch pad, a place where she dashes off ideas and trends that, for whatever reason, catch her eye. This season, that approach gave the collection an easy, casual charm that was hard to resist.</p></div>"
31,fall,2003,f2003,dolce-gabbana,"Dolce &amp; Gabbana idolizes supermodel royalty, and their show had a roster full: Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Amber Valletta and Eva Herzigova were all there, underscoring the longevity of a look the designers first established in the late ’80s. Evangelista opened the show in a bright tangerine parka slung over one of the duo's signature pieces, the black corset dress. It was a combo that stated a general theme, which Stefano Gabbana described as ""techno romance.""</p><p>That meant that pop color—acid yellow, orange, emerald and royal blue—flashed through the collection in shoes, bags and down jackets laden with utility straps and clips. But even if they play up an effervescent moment with details like necklaces made of bottle tops or CDs, or a shot of brash gold lamé, these guys know better than to neglect what they do best. Year after year Dolce &amp; Gabbana's mannish suits and shapely dresses keep women coming back, and they'd never let a passing trend distract from that.</p><p>In a season when menswear is a rising trend, Dolce &amp; Gabbana's pantsuits and shirting looked bang-on relevant. They redrafted the proportions to create new shoulder volume, sometimes slipping a pinstripe bolero or a jacket cut like a kimono over waist-clinching tailoring. White shirts looked great tied with a flourish in front to reemphasize the expert tease of their masculine/feminine styling.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hkpxmp""></div></div><p>For evening, they issued updates on the corset-tight sheaths they've been doing forever, one in a ruched satin rose print, another in black lace, followed by a finale of enough showgirl fringed sparkle and spangled nude tulle to dress the entire cast of <em>Chicago.</em> This is a collection celebrating house classics. And no wonder: Dolce &amp; Gabbana have just opened a whole new business, here at 26 Via della Spiga, devoted to selling remade editions of their greatest vintage hits.</p></div>"
32,fall,2003,f2003,donna-karan,"Being acquired is never easy, and Donna Karan has had some bumpy moments in the two years since French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH bought her company. In a nutshell, she’s Dharma and they’re Greg. But under her free-spirited, New Age exterior is a true Seventh Avenue businesswoman who doesn’t let a few challenges get in her way.</p><p>With her boss (LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, in a rare U.S. appearance) and a fresh crop of company executives sitting in the front row, Karan sent out a sensuous, assertive collection that included references to her own groundbreaking designs of two decades ago. Wool jersey—a fabric to which Karan laid claim from the start of her career—started the show, made into cat suits and skintight dresses inset with silver rings made by her old friend Robert Lee Morris. Karan has famously shed weight on a raw-foods-and-yoga regime, and her renewed love of a long, lean figure was evident. She put emphasis on the midriff, tailoring jackets like corsets to hug the body, wrapping coats and dresses with shiny black leather obis and cutting pants high and tight on the waist. Some of the outerwear pieces, done in loamy brown or ivory cashmere tweeds, creamy goatskin or nubby stretch wool touched with patent leather, were cut along classic fit-and-flare lines; others were done in generous kimono styles that slouched off the body. The designer also played with sequins, tossing a few onto tweed separates, mixing others with suede on a funky beige dress.</p><p>The body beautiful got even more so for evening, as Karan showed a series of goddess-like silk jersey dresses in black or ivory, pulled and draped, with more of Morris’s silver rings. Altogether, it was a solid defense of Karan’s signature thesis—that power dressing and sex appeal can, like Dharma and Greg, go hand in hand.</p></div>"
33,fall,2003,f2003,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten is not one for following trends. There are times when his soft, rich bohemian aesthetic fits in with the rest of what’s happening, and there are times—like now, as a ’60s mod–meets–’80s disco look is ruling the runways—when it doesn’t. It’s not a problem for the Van Noten customer, who likes to collect individual pieces rather than change her look every season. Come fall, she'll have plenty of beautiful options to choose from.</p><p>Shown under a canopy of tiny fairy lights, Van Noten’s collection was hugely feminine and adorned with everything from sequined edges and ruffled hems to floral appliqu¿. As always, the clothes had a subtle ethnic flavor—Chinese floral-print jackets, tops that wrap like kimonos, and sari embroidery on lush, long scarves. But this season the designer also did a little time traveling. Flapper coats and twinkling capelets had a distinctively ’20s feel; drapey layers (homey shawls over coats over sweaters over long skirts) would not have been out of place at an ERA rally; and fur tippets brought to mind the sort of 1940s lady who wouldn’t dream of leaving the house without gloves. Everything had a well-loved feel, like a beautiful old couture piece rediscovered in a closet and worn with a striped cotton pajama top or a deliciously nubby sweater.</p><p>Backstage after the show, Van Noten said he’d been going for a dreamy mood. “You can think about fashion and try to figure out what’s hip, but I don’t think it’s a time for that right now,” he said. “I just wanted to do something beautiful, to create a fairy-tale collection.” In that he certainly succeeded.</p></div>"
34,fall,2003,f2003,emanuel-ungaro,"Some sort of fairy tale on ice unfolded on the circular runway at Emanuel Ungaro. Crunching her way across the crystal-strewn floor, the heroine had a look all her own: pale, drifty layerings of gossamer, worn over sparkly Lurex-shot leggings and high heels.</p><p>By mixing up the fluttery, ruffle-edged printed chiffon with sporty pieces like jersey tanks, big parkas, hoodies and funked-up fur, Giambattista Valli managed to skate clear of the cloying sweetness that sometimes threatens to drown this collection. Valli also turned down the volume on the vibrant Ungaro palette, using subtle layers of grays, bois de rose and greige, interspersed with sparkles of silver and gold lamé. The tops and dresses, with their rippling transparent frills, poet sleeves and flounces were in step with the casual, falling-off-the-shoulder look, and the leggings added the essential kicker to make it all current. Best in show? The casually decorative, tufty gray rabbit furs implanted with trailing chiffon ribbons and some sexy reworkings of the house's signature smoking jackets, cut with draped sleeves.</p><p>The 36-year-old Valli is making all the right modernizing moves at Ungaro—with one caveat. Fairy tales that go on too long send people to sleep. Next season he needs to take scissors to the plot.</p></div>"
35,fall,2003,f2003,emilio-pucci,"Pucci’s bright swirly prints and high spirits belong in the sun—whether that’s on beaches in summer or at ski resorts in winter. It’s taken a while for this collection to get oriented in the right direction, but now that Christian Lacroix is at the design helm, it’s finally showing signs of living up to its sportily glamorous heritage.</p><p>Lacroix exerted his talent for color and pattern in a collection that looked best at its least serious and most playful. He brought back Pucci archive prints in gray, red, white and black to apply to the obligatory city-friendly sweaters, minidresses and short trench coats, but the show picked up speed when he took to the idea of the slopes. Bubble-shaped nylon blousons in a riot of pinks and yellow, black knit salopettes with bands of color and zippy ribbed cardigans with quilted print fronts might not technically qualify as skiwear, but at this fashion altitude, it’s the fun that’s the point.</p><p>The further Lacroix pushed things, the better they got. Transferring Pucci psychedelia into patchwork furs and huge multipastel fox hats, he hit moments of nutty delight that had the audience smiling from end to end. For après-ski, Lacroix dutifully ran through a slew of dressy options in plissé fabrics. The standout was a delicious absinthe-green patterned velvet minidress with a fluff of fox at the collar, floating capelike over colored opaque tights. It was beautiful—but, as far as Lacroix has come with this collection, he still needs to learn how to edit.</p></div>"
36,fall,2003,f2003,emma-cook,"Emma Cook builds her collections around a time-traveling character named Susan, who, in her few seasons on the periphery of the London scene, has assumed the guise of everyone from Joan of Arc to Barbarella. It’s a cute way for her inventor to comment on current trends, and this time around ""Starboard Susan"" drifted naively to Earth as a sweet-toothed, girlie version of the space-age look. That meant jersey aviator helmets, cutout minidresses and jumpers with white tights, and clunky, low block-heeled patent pumps attached to ankle socks.</p><p>Some of Susan’s dresses and A-line skirts were pieced together with leather and suede into a pattern of the planets. Others were in a black and white shell-and-starfish print done on jersey, a couple of which were cut with wings of fabric attached to her wrists by plastic bracelets. At still other moments she appeared ready for countdown in bibbed overalls and hooded jumpsuits. The starship trooper’s more charming escapades came when she switched from monochrome into pink or yellow and decorated her shifts with real shells and a necklace of mother-of-pearl. All the same, though Susan was one of the first to go ’60s-futuristic last season, her wardrobe this time had a limp quality and never really took off.</p></div>"
37,fall,2003,f2003,emporio-armani,"<em>She’s got legs.</em> That’s not the message the fashion pack expects from Giorgio Armani, but from the minute his first model walked out in a black A-line mini coat—with high heels—it was clear his Emporio Armani girl was dashing off in a new direction. The ’60s are in the air, and Emporio has caught the kicky feeling. Armani’s version of short and cute steered clear of vintage rehash while leaving the line’s reputation for androgyny behind.</p><p>That was a refreshing departure, and it made Emporio Armani accessible to young women on the hunt for ideas to integrate into a fall look. The designer mixed textures, soft jackets and flippy skirts, chiefly in his signature palette of black, white and gray, with a few floral prints and a sprinkling of sparkle to pretty things up. There were variations galore, but mod striped mohair sweaters, double-layered skirts with a stylized poppy print, a firefighter’s leather-edged mac and a couple of zippy little leather jackets stood out. For evening, there was a lot of shadow play in opaque and sheer georgette and skimpy black satin dresses with diamanté clasps. The only girl to wear color was the last one out: Milla Jovovich, the face of Emporio’s advertising, wore a pink ruched frock with black shoulder straps—accessorized with a sunny smile.</p></div>"
38,fall,2003,f2003,fendi,"<em>Blade Runner</em> merged with the medieval. That’s where Karl Lagerfeld took Fendi for fall, and if it sounds a tad heavy, don’t be misled. That futuristic story line strung together some of the most high-spirited feats in fur and leather to be witnessed on planet fashion.</p><p>Lagerfeld began by cutting all his lengths short, concentrating on sculpted shapes to emphasize the body. His version of the season's ubiquitous down parka was a cross between a tiny formfitting ski jacket and a Renaissance doublet. With the addition of iridescent oil-slick leather, collars and cuffs done in sheared weasel, and zippers implanted in fuchsia satin, the generic turned super extraordinary.</p><p>Showstopping coats were fielded against a palette of petrol blue, purple, lavender and a slew of reflective metallics. Natalia Vodianova stepped out in ribbed silver leather that sprouted quivering tufts of white fox. Neat coats in gray Persian lamb came with laminated zones textured with embossing. Curly cascades of Mongolian lamb spilled out of a skeletal framework of cloth. One inside-out fur with a vast drooping collar was sewn from a single, enormous circular patchwork.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""0jvzg""></div></div><p>In all, the collection showed Lagerfeld's conviction that haute luxury needs to be pushed to the limit in order to stay compelling. That doesn’t necessarily mean over-the-top freakishness, either, which he proved with a lean, mean sable-lined chocolate crocodile coat, picked out in copper topstitching. It simply looked the epitome of sophisticated modernity.</p></div>"
39,fall,2003,f2003,gianfranco-ferre,"Imagine Madame Recamier on a Harley-Davidson and you're getting close to the starting point for Gianfranco Ferrés Fall collection. The designer noted in the program that he happens to share a birthday with Napoléon Bonaparte, a piece of synchronicity that put him on a historical-militaristic path that met up somehow with today's mood of aggression. The result, inspired partly by eighteenth-century French Revolutionary costumes, partly by motorcycle-gang-tough jeanswear and studded leathers, is a collision of fierce cutting and romantic flourishes.</p><p>The historical references included swaggering Napoleonic uniforms and the delicate empire dresses of the Empress Josephine and her court ladies. Floor-sweeping coats in black cashmere or brown leather came with straps and buckles in place of frogging. Breeches turned into zipped, cropped pants, and the puffed sleeve of the Directoire transformed into tightly seamed jackets lined in fur. All this was mixed in with stylized studded, zippered leather motorcycle pants and the kind of operatic collars that are the designer's signature.</p><p>Although Ferré operates on his own in terms of personal inspiration, the collection hit on the general trend for a raised-waist silhouette and an inflated shoulder line. It remains to be seen, however, just who will brave the sheer evening gowns with black lace panties fashioned into what looked like the pattern of an imperial shield.</p></div>"
40,fall,2003,f2003,gibo,"As a legion of thirtysomething designers assumes seniority, expressions of a new generation’s formative influences keep coming out of the woodwork. Gibo by Julie Verhoeven, an Italian line designed and presented in London, is one example of the struggle to transform the costume offenses of the 1980s into a new wave of style. Verhoeven, a noted illustrator who contributed to Marc Jacobs’s Fall 2002 collection for Louis Vuitton, is in the vanguard of girls whose first sensations of glamour were had to the strains of <em>Dallas,</em> while their mommies donned colored pumps and adjusted their shoulder pads for an evening out.</p><p>In this debut collection, Verhoeven showed wide-collar two-tone coats, shirred and draped purple slink dresses, lots of leaf-shape cuts, plenty of novelty buttons, quilted satin, sproutings of lace, and giant excrescences of junk jewelry. Was it ugly? Yes—but, arguably, not ugly enough. Things seemed to be complicated by the need to provide a semblance of commercial sanity in the collection—hence the skinny black pants that kept turning up and the drabness of the color palette. If Verhoeven had run amok with nasty ’80s color clashes and had had full-on ironic fun with the tacky exuberance of the time, she might have ended up with something so bad it was good. Instead it just came off as rather sad.</p></div>"
41,fall,2003,f2003,giorgio-armani,"For his main Fall collection, Giorgio Armani followed through on the short lengths and feminine sensibility he explored with his Emporio line. It was a much younger, softer feel that almost—but didn’t quite—cross over into the land of cute. In essence he recut his distinctively supple jackets to hug rib cage and bust and switched his focus from pants to flared skirts that stop five inches or so above the knee. It’s not a complete change of character, though: everything the designer showed for winter was in his beloved black and white.</p><p>Though short, Armani’s skirts—often done in stiff black ciré fabric—were a long way from the tarty pelmets that have been strutting other Milanese runways and a more feasible option for his core clientele of grown-up women (if you overlook the patterned sheer tights that opened the show, that is). His use of contrasting textures, meanwhile, turned up several variations on current trends. There were a few strapless black dresses and couture-like coats that put a modern spin on ’50s ladylike styling. And pieces like a black PVC jacket and a simple but decorative beaded tank are the kind of key items that can spark up a winter wardrobe. At a time when women love to cherry-pick across brands instead of acquiring single-label top-to-toe looks, those versatile possibilities alone represent a subtle breakthrough for the house of Armani.</p></div>"
42,fall,2003,f2003,givenchy,"In his third season as creative director at Givenchy, Julien Macdonald showed a collection that was sleek, dark and above all mysterious. Models wore their clothes like battle armor—slim leather and tweed coats over turtlenecks over knee-length skirts, accessorized with thigh-high boots and black leather gloves, often to the elbow. Most of the time the only skin exposed was on their faces. Not surprisingly, the fictional muse that inspired the designer this season is a woman with something to hide. ""She's a KGB spy living in Paris,"" he said backstage after the show. ""She's a woman you see only in passing and only at night.”</p><p>This collection was more restrained and classically sophisticated than we've come to expect from Macdonald; there were none of the gold lam¿ jumpsuits or shredded pastel denims he's been known to do in the past. He seemed to be looking back at Givenchy’s Audrey Hepburn heyday, showing chic, slimmed-down versions of the house’s classic belted trench coat in combinations of wool, leather and tweed. He even closed the show with a series of variations on the little black dress, trimmed with wide bands of crystals that, the designer said, were informed by the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels diamonds owned by the Duchess of Windsor. They twinkled like rainbows under the runway lights—proving that though he may have turned down the volume, Macdonald hasn’t entirely given up on glitz.</p></div>"
43,fall,2003,f2003,gucci,"This season every major designer is talking about creating a ""beauty"" strong enough to defy our anxious times. Backstage that was the word Tom Ford used to characterize his Fall collection for Gucci—a collection in which beauty was personified as a power vixen extravagantly armored to face down a troubled world.</p><p>She made her first entrance in a white coat with a huge collar, ballooning pushed-up sleeves and a full skirt, her midsection lashed into a buckled, corseted belt. With wicked black, spiky over-the-knee boots and long leather gloves, she struck the high-glam silhouette that dominated the show through a sequence of coats, jackets and slinky skirts seamed to cling to every dangerous curve.</p><p>The Gucci mini of last season was dropped—literally. Now the length is back down to the knee, with the emphasis on dramatic upstanding collars and voluminous sleeves, often exaggerated in fur and contrasted with the erotic suggestiveness of lingerie beneath. The skirts and dresses—paneled, ruched and pieced together with strips of ribbon—called up comparisons with corsetry. For evening, there were gowns constructed with cutout zones of sparkling mesh and frilled bra tops; others snaked to the floor, held in place with complex asymmetric straps crossing the torso and shoulders.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""erx45""></div></div><p>If Ford is treading the territory mapped out by Thierry Mugler and Azzedine Alaïa in the ’80s, it’s no surprise. Much of fashion is heading in that direction anyway, and Ford, after all, bases Gucci’s entire brand proposition on finding new ways of upping the ante on sex season after season.</p></div>"
44,fall,2003,f2003,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow is the last of the conceptualists to have come out of London—or maybe anywhere. Of the same generation (and Central Saint Martins schooling) as Hussein Chalayan, Morrow approaches design as an academic restructuring exercise, taking on the challenge of assimilating scientific and sport technologies into clothing. His defining twist—and what makes him interesting—is that he also has a taste for gorgeous old-world ornamentation.</p><p>Morrow said his thought process this season had been triggered by looking at the structure of parachutes used for dropping freight and by a pair of anti-G-force pants used in military aviation. No matter. What the audience grasped was what counts: his ability to make things like a great white satin-bound coat, skinny pants in rich gold silk jacquard, and narrow, inventively cut cashmere cord blazers. The two-inch-wide nylon tape used in parachute construction was incorporated in tailoring and interpreted as strips of ribbon running across a turtleneck. Layerings of mesh tanks and sweaters looked effortlessly cool over derivations of military pants.</p><p>Morrow has a strong sense of color, meaning he’s one of the few who can mix purple, sage green, peach, metallics and even the season’s potentially heinous royal blue with aplomb. When he circled round to end where he began, showing looped-up parachute tape bunched into dresses and tops, he landed firmly in the zone of avant-garde experiment. But, though it may pain him to hear it, it’s his more straightforward, wearable pieces that save him from the dead end of ’90s art-house clothing.</p></div>"
45,fall,2003,f2003,helmut-lang,"If bad times are a-coming, Helmut Lang is the man to outfit the brave. For fall he issued multifunctional layers for the urban warrior to strap on, carving everything to an athletic body line to help his army of followers stand tall in the face of geopolitical meltdown.</p><p>Soft armor for the corsetry militia. Leggings done in cross-laced layers. Form-hugging felted coats and knits, cut and sliced in flaps to secure with Velcro and magnets. Jersey holsters, girdle skirts, gartered stockings, harnesses and sexy zones of stretch. If it all sounds a tad busy and tarty, trust Lang to douse things with the impeccable colors of austere chic. Using black with navy or gray, a touch of dusty pink and then transparencies of ecru and white for night, he made clothes that stalk a fine line between his signature obsessions and a clean new silhouette.</p><p>Lang continued his splendid record of conviction for producing a covertly perverse luxury. The evidence included wedge-heeled boots, sometimes done in patent and trimmed with shearling; plissé chiffon chopped into minidresses; and leather stamped into a suggestion of high-tech military camouflage. His much-loved deluxe parkas and menswear coatings went missing from this Winter collection, but perhaps they’re being kept in the back now that so many have copied them. He certainly hasn’t abandoned his minimalism-with-a-gorgeous-kick: when he sent out Natalia Vodianova wearing a men’s shirt, skinny sweater and plain short skirt with a fringe of goat fur swinging from the front, his fans all but fainted.</p></div>"
46,fall,2003,f2003,imitation-of-christ,"The invitation gave it all away: red-and-white striped, in an envelope with confetti and a peanut, it was advance warning that IOC designer Tara Subkoff had run away to join the circus. And indeed her show, held in the cold, cold riding ring at Manhattan’s Pier 63, offered several variations on the theme of the spectacular. Trapeze artists, stilt walkers and trick ponies had nothing on a front row that included Harvey Keitel, Lorraine Bracco, Finola Hughes, Hope Atherton, Liz Goldwyn and China Chow, as well as the ever-multiplying, ever-sequined clan that is As Four.</p><p>The collection was presented in three sections. Camouflage menswear was followed by vintage-y, majorette-inspired gala dresses, which in turn gave way to a group of all-gray cotton clothes on a procession of models led by Chloë Sevigny, as Nick Cave's “This Is a Weeping Song” played on the soundtrack. The lyrics, the drab cadre of models and the military overtones hinted at social commentary, but the message, if there was one, was undercut by the finale: a fat lady singing—literally—to an operatic accompaniment over the sound system.</p><p>Once again, IOC has staged an elaborate, metaphorical critique of the fashion industry—with its focus on appearance, technical skill and some sleight of hand, it could be likened to a circus. But next time, it would be nice to really see some clothes. And some heating wouldn’t hurt, either.</p></div>"
47,fall,2003,f2003,james-coviello,"Although milliner-turned-designer James Coviello moved his show to the tents this season, he remained true to his romantic, vintage-y aesthetic. Inspired by a trip to Switzerland, the designer showed his ""1920s Alpine/Edwardian shooting party"" collection to a front row that included longtime friend Anna Sui as well as his affenpinscher, Francis.</p><p>True to form, Coviello built his presentation around knitwear, showcasing handcraft rather than trends and emphasizing the personal, small-scale nature of the label. Preppy, colorful sweaters, embellished with hearts and rhinestone-eyed reindeers, had a shrunk-in-the-washer fit and were paired with cargo pants in Pendleton wool plaids, printed velvets and denim, augmented with bondage-like straps. Femininity and sportiness played off each other in plaid suits with flouncy skirts, while floaty chiffon and lace dresses exuded old-time charm. A series of vests and jackets with folkloric embroidery displayed the handiwork for which Coviello is known, while the accessories—pointy lace-up and L.L. Bean boots—completed the casual, woodsy mood set by the antler chandeliers hung over the runway.</p></div>"
48,fall,2003,f2003,jasper-conran,"The relative rarity of a sophisticated collection dedicated to making grown women look polished makes Jasper Conran a standout here. In a country notorious for launching and then discarding young talents in short order, Conran is an exception who has managed to keep a business uninterruptedly since the mid ’80s.</p><p>This collection, based lightly on a cinematic chic of the ’60s, showed why. When Erin O’Connor walked out in a black shearling coat picked out with narrow bands of white leather, wearing slingbacks and swinging a matching patent purse on a chain, you could feel the collective shoulders of the audience drop with relief. It was a commitment to a certain snappy glamour, a nod to Audrey Hepburn—and even if we’ve seen it before, well, it’s a plot whose appeal never dims.</p><p>For day, the designer turned out smart little tweed coats with shearling collars, concise pea jackets and slim, well-cut black pants that were a current gloss on a classic. For evening, he had thought through all the variations on formalwear a modern woman might need and responded with pretty but practical scalloped-edge satin skirts and coats, and delicate powder-puff-pink dresses that burst into layers of ostrich at the skirt. To Conran’s credit, by the end of the show he’d shaken off any lingering shadow of retro.</p></div>"
49,fall,2003,f2003,jean-paul-gaultier,"Jean Paul Gaultier's shows are always a bit of a romp around a theme, as serious clothes hold together a string of Parisian one-liners. This season it was literally playtime on the runway—a glass structure supported by an army of dolls. To set the scene, Natalia Vodianova, fashion's favorite child-woman, toddled out wearing a smocked Norwegian sweater with a pair of infantile black frilly panties over woolly tights.</p><p>But be not afraid. Gaultier toyed with the baby-doll look, turning it into tiny puff-sleeved swing-back jackets and an aviator-style shearling, as well as romper suits (one, very scarily, in leather), but he didn't let the kid stuff distract from the great pieces that ground his work. A lot of those were furs, like the big knitted sweatshirt pulled over a cheerleader skirt and the striped jersey with a swathed neck and wide sleeves that followed from his couture collection.</p><p>He went a bit askew with some of the dippy Rick Owens-esque raw-edged leather and hefty handkerchief-point skirts, guaranteed to make any girl look a mile wide. But when he focused on reinventing the masculine/feminine tailoring and streetwear he's been playing with since the ’80s, the collection (in this revivalist moment) took off. His olive ski jacket, lashed tight with webbing straps and clips, is a fall classic. And that's no kidding.</p></div>"
50,fall,2003,f2003,jeremy-scott,"As a follow-up to last season's Devo-meets-Thierry Mugler collection, Jeremy Scott staged an elaborate fashion/cinema performance at the Tribeca Grand Hotel that could best be described as Steven Cojocaru-meets-Pierre Cardin.</p><p>The Beverly Hills–based designer's presentation was a spoof on a Hollywood awards show, as Scott (in a Gucci tuxedo and bandana) greeted each model in the style of a cheesy red-carpet commentator. Asked what she'd like to see more of in Hollywood, Anouck Lepère, in a silver coat with a radiating ring collar, responded “more Belgian movies,” while Croatian model Natasha Vojnovic advocated ""peace, no war!"" Lisa Marie and Liz Goldwyn were among the celebrities who walked the red carpet and also appeared in Scott’s movie, which premiered after the arrivals show and featured Asia Argento, China Chow, Monet Mazur and Tori Spelling. What did the models wear? Glamour dresses with stencils reading ""icon,"" ""bombshell"" and ""goddess"" and featuring the requisite sequins, marabou and lamé. New developments included denims with the designer’s face embroidered on the back pocket and Oscar statuettes on jacket sleeves, as well as custom lamé and leopard-print Adidas/Scott sneakers.</p><p>While designers like Imitation of Christ try to dissect fashion, Scott takes a literal, good-hearted and adoring approach. For him, it's all about “looking fabulous, darling.”</p></div>"
51,fall,2003,f2003,jil-sander,"Audience expectations of the Jil Sander collection have shifted. No longer one of the high-flown conceptual agenda setters of fashion, it now belongs to the category of Milanese shows that process a general mood into a line firmly intended to be commercial.</p><p>That means the success of the collection now depends on the market appropriateness of its chosen theme rather than groundbreaking inventiveness. For spring it was upscale athletic, this season posh punk. Milan Vukmirovic opened his show with a slick black patent motorcycle jacket, followed later by a beige patent trench. These, and a satin parka with straps and chrome D-rings, are the kind of items that can be cherry-picked out of the collection as reasonable, wearable classics that will be understandable when hanging in stores.</p><p>More questionable was Vukmirovic's follow-through with the idea of plaid. Kilts—never terribly flattering at the best of times—came redone in tiers of pleats made into asymmetric skirts or extended into dresses. The impression of watered-down punk iconography continued in the white shirt with an appliqu¿ of embroidered wings on the back, the leather bondage neck piece that tethered a halter-neck silk scarf dress, and T-shirts with “Wild heart” and “Sweet Angel” printed on them. Of course, Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto have all had something gutsy to say on these subjects in the past, but Vukmirovic's interpretation went by without anything new to add.</p></div>"
52,fall,2003,f2003,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart makes clothes for uptown girls who go downtown to shop. For fall, the designer took a retro turn, delving into the lighthearted romanticism of Biba, the quintessential '60s London boutique. The show opened with a drop-waisted coat over a flared skirt, a silhouette borrowed from childrenswear, which set the tone for the baby-doll inspired looks that followed—including pinafore, tunic and Empire line dresses.</p><p>""I returned to my roots for this collection,"" Stuart said. ""I did the sweet, ladylike and pretty looks I love."" Among these were a very grown-up fur chubby (worn by Angie Schmit) and a number of short, snappy coats—rendered in everything from tweed to solid wool to dressy Jacquard—that could be worn to class by a coed or to dinner at eight.</p></div>"
53,fall,2003,f2003,john-galliano,"John Galliano put on the liveliest, most upbeat show of the season tonight at the Theatre de l'Empire on avenue Wagram. As a jazzed-up version of “Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy” blasted and neon showgirl lights flashed, the models tripped haughtily down the runway in twisted, bustled, blown-up ’40s suits, rainbow-bright crocodile platform shoes with diamond buckles, Joan Crawford–inspired evening dresses and giant glued-on triangular plastic eyebrows to match.</p><p>It was a collection that could only have come from the imagination of Galliano, a man who's channeled everything from Bollywood to kabuki and made all of it completely his own. This season he said he was going for a ""granny from hell"" look, focusing on real urban glamour and honest-to-goodness dressing up.</p><p>The show opened with a series of slim-skirted suits that were anything but classic. The palette of choice, inspired by the supersaturated tones of Crawford-era films, was totally Technicolor: apple green, peridot, cyclamen, lipstick red. Exaggerated hourglass shapes with huge bow bustles made waists look tiny, while shoulders were enormously puffed and asymmetrical, occasionally exploding into poufs of fruit-printed silk. All this was followed by pinup-girl lingerie—merry widows, garter belts, thigh-high silk stockings and sexy little tap pants—far too chic to be relegated to the bedroom.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""1nqbm""></div></div><p>For day, Galliano showed pom-pom-trimmed powder-pink sweaters that fell almost to the knee and printed silk dresses accessorized with giant rhinestone pins—one, in an overblown poppy print, looked particularly fresh. Evening looks, meanwhile, included highly Oscar-worthy gowns with all manner of ruffles and bustles and bows. (Nicole Kidman would be well advised to choose the dramatically draped peony silk.)</p><p>The Fall 2003 collection will be the first to fill what Galliano calls his ""dream boutique""—his first flagship store in Paris, where he plans to host dinner parties in the shop windows. His excitement at the prospect was evident in the clothes, and the energy was contagious. As the audience filed out of the theater, even the most jaded members of the fashion flock were smiling.</p></div>"
54,fall,2003,f2003,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald’s London shows become more and more like two halves of a tabloid photo-opportunity party interrupted by a fashion parade. When Shirley Bassey took her seat for the 6 p.m. show, she probably didn’t think she’d have to wait nearly two hours to see what her fellow Welsh citizen has in mind for fall.</p><p>Before proceedings could begin, of course, the champagne-stoked audience watched Leah Wood deejay and attempted to attach names to the local soap-opera and TV celebs who packed the house. Pink and Christina Aguilera were the only two stars with any international standing, but to the British market insatiably eager for nonstop celebrity info, that scarcely mattered.</p><p>When the show finally started, the designer sent out what he believes in most fervently: tight, sexy, in-your-face clothes. He delivered jackets and combat pants that stuck to the body, often implanted with heavy-duty gold zippers. More to the point, he produced the kind of clothing that will allow the aforementioned tabloid fodder to appear in public as near to naked as possible.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dlgjjo""></div></div><p>Wisely, Macdonald brought his original distinguishing talent—knitwear—into play via some spider-webby catsuits and a tiny dress of crocheted stars calculated to show more of Liberty Ross than the world dreamed possible. If the scantily clad catch a chill, he has a solution: Saga Furs is a sponsor, and there were patchwork fur coats aplenty.</p><p>His Versace-esque evening gowns were a dismal pastiche of the maestro’s achievements. But when Macdonald knitted up his own ideas, the boy from Wales got a fleeting nod of approval from the fashion press—as they stampeded toward the after-party.</p></div>"
55,fall,2003,f2003,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s beautiful Fall collection was every bit as romantic as the show’s venue, the Imperial ballroom at the InterContinental hotel, with its Grecian columns, painted cherubs and gilded <em>boiserie.</em> To the strains of cello concertos and lilting arias, models glided beneath the enormous chandeliers in awning-striped tea dresses, Peter Pan–collared jackets over flounced skirts and wasp-waisted tweed suits, trimmed with oversize bows. The silhouettes were right out of a Merchant Ivory period drama, but Watanabe would never be satisfied with interpreting any era so straightforwardly. The hems and sleeves were left raw and unraveling, and the rough, nubby tweeds and tartans were more Artful Dodger than <em>Room with a View</em>’s Lucy Honeychurch.</p><p>Sweet femininity and innocence were the order of the day, however, played up via giant hairpieces, teased to resemble frilly, wide-brimmed Edwardian hats or cascading as floor-length Rapunzel tresses that masked both the models’ faces and what they were wearing. Watanabe threw in several amusing riffs on classic Chanel: Madame’s pearl chokers sewn onto sweaters, chain belts threaded through full skirts (the effect was more punk than haute bourgeois) and the whole idea of the proper tweed suit as a kind of social armor.</p><p>Backstage after the show, Watanabe described the collection as “classic clothing interpreted in my own way.” And though it would be a stretch to call anything Watanabe does commercial, there were some very wearable pieces here. The slim dresses and flatteringly snug jackets, in particular, will surely be on many wish lists come September.</p></div>"
56,fall,2003,f2003,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli’s brief, unadorned presentation bore witness to her conviction that a few well-expressed ideas make a stronger impact than a cacophony of half-baked gimmicks.</p><p>Retro currents run through every season, and this fall the attention seems to be on the late '50s and early '60s. Adeli demonstrated her respect for the past with slouchy sack jackets, tunic tops, blouson minis and perfectly fitted dresses that recalled masters of elegance like Cristobal Balenciaga and Hubert de Givenchy. She used appropriately ladylike fabrics—silk faille, satin, lightweight wool, brocade and chiffon—in a restricted palette made up mostly of black, navy and charcoal, but sparked with the occasional burst of color (a coral brocade coat, for example, or a green chiffon and gold lamé mini).</p><p>Demure though her inspirations might be, Adeli has a rock 'n' roll side, too. It came out in the ruffly, torn edges on chiffon tops and dresses, super-skinny pants under jackets, and a great new version of the old reliable black leather coat, made regal with an elaborately pinched and sewn collar.</p></div>"
57,fall,2003,f2003,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole has never been shy about expressing his point of view on current affairs. Political aphorisms, often in the form of puns, have been the mainstay of his advertising for more than a decade, and he used the moments before his fall show to present a short film that broadcast a few more (""Condoms should be used in all conceivable situations,"" etc.).</p><p>What those ideas have to do with Cole’s clothes is left to the viewer’s imagination, since the designer’s take on women’s fashion is decidedly unpolitical. The clean, simple collection was based around a few basic shapes clearly inspired by early-'60s mods. Minidresses and skirts were worn with flat silver boots; tight jeans and trousers were paired with short, fitted tops and sweaters, rendered in black, white, gray and silver with dashes of green, yellow or blue. Throughout, Cole used fabrics heavy on surface interest: felted wool, nubby knits, velvet and corduroy. The net effect was young and moderately sharp—just right for this designer’s style-savvy, but not edgy, consumer. Cole’s social conscience may be left of the mainstream, but his fashion is aimed squarely at center field.</p></div>"
58,fall,2003,f2003,krizia,"Krizia’s indomitable Mariuccia Mandelli has worked with a battalion of gifted designers, from Walter Albini in the ’70s to more recent conscripts Alber Elbaz and Jean-Paul Knott. This season Mandelli tapped the 34-year-old Hamish Morrow, whose own-name collection was a highlight of the London shows, to be her creative squadron leader. Morrow’s goal was to stay true to the spirit of a house celebrated for its sophisticated knitwear and adult approach to Milanese style, creating, as he put it, “expensive, luxe clothes that are effortless without being banal.”</p><p>Instead of the opulent fur and crocodile seen on some other Milan runways, Morrow opted for a sense of luxury through the “volume of the fabric.” His pelican-collared coats and waisted jackets, often worn with skinny-leg pants and boots, provided a more creative take on the ’80s/Alaïa trend that has surfaced so strongly this season. Brought in to collaborate on the collection just two months ago, the designer worked with existing fabrics, which juxtaposed double-face wools, metallic python and a thick, cracquelure leather with airy chiffons and crepe; the typical Krizia palette was in effect—carbon, tarnished silver and storm-cloud gray—with some injudicious viridian-green accents. But even if Morrow’s quirky, innovative use of color was missing, his hand could be sensed in the studious draperies and in details like the cashmere gauze pieces poetically overlaid with cloudy tiers of chiffon ribbon.</p></div>"
59,fall,2003,f2003,lagerfeld-gallery,"The Carousel du Louvre turned intergalactic for the Lagerfeld Gallery show, as red laser beams flashed and models emerged from clear beam-me-up-Scottie tubes to hit the runway.</p><p>The proceedings opened with a series of strict black suits—jackets and waistcoats worn with crisp white shirts, leather ties, and cropped skirts or cuffed trousers, all as skinny as the man who designed them. The collection ran red hot—thanks to fiery crimson miniskirts and fringed cherry-red fur scarves that dangled alluringly down the back almost to the knee—then turned icily chic, as twinkling platinum mesh tops and embroidered silver overcoats made an appearance to the sound of a disco-fied <em>Nutcracker Suite.</em></p><p>What held it all together were the impossibly high starched Edwardian collars—think Ryan Phillippe in <em>Gosford Park</em>—that the models wore with everything from suits to faded denim jeans from Lagerfeld’s two-seasons-old collaboration with Diesel. “It starts with the collars,” said the designer backstage when asked about his inspirations. “It’s not a historical reference or a menswear influence. It’s simply the idea of an impeccable white turtleneck that gives a clean, streamlined, graphic feeling to jeans, to T-shirts—to everything.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6ykdv""></div></div><p>During the final walk Lagerfeld took to the runway himself, in his own tight jeans, narrow black jacket and, of course, one of the mood-setting collars, his hair held in place by the same gleaming silver clip that had adorned the models’ ponytails. “Maybe it’s a little too much for me?” he asked well-wishers after the show. “Not to worry, Monsieur Lagerfeld,” an admirer assured him. “You wear it well.”</p></div>"
60,fall,2003,f2003,lanvin,"There aren’t many designers in the world who can handle the feminine and the refined without looking dated and chichi. But Alber Elbaz, at Lanvin, is one of the few capable of pushing delicate classicism toward an inspiring new edge. Declaring that he “wanted to do something beautiful that reflects what’s going on around us,” he took extravagant materials—satin ribbon, Chantilly lace, couture-grade silk, python and fur—and worked them alongside the more modern, disciplined look of exposed zippers and ribbed jersey.</p><p>Elbaz’s defining looks included neat black waisted knee-length dresses made of vertical lengths of ribbon invisibly set on strips of tulle; as the models walked, the narrowness of the silhouette broke into a gorgeous fan. The ribbon motif ran throughout the collection, sometimes flattened into an asymmetric bow on the front of a jacket or the derri¿re of a skirt. Exquisite knife-edge pleating turned up in a lipstick-red dress, a strict belted coat swinging into a plissé skirt, and as glamorous detail in the back vent of an ultrachic black taffeta trench with ribbon-tied cuffs.</p><p>The ladylike-meets-military feel was at its most focused when the decorative haberdashery got worked into ribbed knit zippered suits. A fur sweater with a zipper in the shoulder marched over tight pants tucked into black boots. After that came a slew of little cocktail dresses, some made entirely in black lace, others as sheaths of geometric bugle beading or distressed silver sequin. Crafted with extraordinary skill, the collection was another step in the reevaluation of charm and luxury that is shaping up as fashion’s newest movement.</p></div>"
61,fall,2003,f2003,louis-vuitton,"A new big-shouldered, graphic silhouette is working its way into the fashion system, and Marc Jacobs is bent on making it look like something we’ve never seen before. For starters, his short, slightly stiff navy coat had a large wide-set collar embellished with darkly sparkling disks and swung over a felt skirt, long socks and high square-toe crocodile pumps. The volume of that rounded shoulder, cut on the curve, stood out—literally—through the entire Louis Vuitton collection. It surfaced in sleeveless coats worn over big-sleeved sweaters and in the new shape of his beloved pea jacket; it was exaggerated even more in the furry mass of a caped Mongolian coat and in the funnel-shaped stole that was part of a suit.</p><p>By cropping skirts and dresses short, often with an under layer or a squared-off panel hitting a different level in back, Jacobs filtered ’60s and ’80s influences to come up with something fresh. There was a touch of the current feel for space-age-slash-medieval militarism in the studded tunics and coats cut to hint at armor-plated layers. Formfitting ribbed knit dresses with a hint of Claude Montana about them ended in a flip of gladiator pleats. But a couple of simply pretty tiered chiffon dresses, tied with velvet bows—and all those cute socks—kept the show from stumbling under the weight of its references.</p><p>One of the ways Jacobs keeps his luxury lighthearted is an irreverent patching together of precious traditional fabrics with something flashily modern. For fall, he rendered the classic brown-and-yellow monogram in printed vinyl and paired it with tweed in a raincoat and a trashy-meets-ladylike handbag—his iconic Louis Vuitton-craze device for the season.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""pkqm7""></div></div><p>If the designer had kept his audience guessing at the influences behind the show, all became clear when the fans surged back to congratulate him. As Catherine Denueve emerged from the throng, Jacobs grabbed her hand and exclaimed, “It was you! That David Bailey picture of you in the socks and short skirt. Remember? That and Joan of Arc—my heroines!”</p></div>"
62,fall,2003,f2003,luella,"Luella Bartley is not one to dawdle. She gets a feeling for a season, she puts it on the runway, and then… bang, she's onto the next thing. Case in point: While her spring collection was packed with bubbly, body-conscious fashions inspired by athletics, fall's line is aimed at serious urban hipsters who have the lyrics to ""Clash City Rockers"" committed to memory.</p><p>In a season where clothes are getting shorter and tighter, Bartley pulled a 180, showing supersize boyfriend jackets over ripped-up Levis, generous overcoats and full-cut pinstripe trousers with platform winkle pickers. (There were, admittedly, some slimmer looks, like fitted sweaters and knit dresses ornamented with big toothy zippers, and slim knit pants tucked into socks.) Lest anyone forget that she has a taste for fine things, Bartley added some luxury pieces, like an army duffle coat augmented with fur and worn over a black and gold bias-cut dress. For those seeking traditional sex appeal, meanwhile, there were satin minis and a black pencil skirt cut tight enough to be a girdle. Bartley even has a new handbag line, making it possible for loyal customers to carry a piece of the designer's inimitable aesthetic at all times.</p></div>"
63,fall,2003,f2003,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Under Marc Jacobs’ direction, even the remnants of awkward adolescence can yield fashion gold. With his secondary line, the designer plays up some of his favorite inspirations—’70s teen culture and the haphazard chic of thrift-store style—to create the young, zippy looks that keep his hip customers coming back for more.</p><p>While spring’s collection was like a rummage through an artsy girl’s closet, fall was more a stroll through the hallway of a rather tough high school. Taking workaday looks such as lumberjack plaid and faded denim, Jacobs cropped and nipped them to create neat little jackets and pants. He showed lots of jeans, cut skinny and cropped mid-calf or with a bit of ribbon running down the side seam, as well as A-line minis and dresses similar in spirit to the mod-inspired collection he had presented the previous night. Knits showed up as basics (ribbed turtlenecks were everywhere) or in girlish cardigans and pullovers with trompe l’oeil sweetheart necklines. Jacobs cemented the ’70s feeling by mixing slightly clashing shades of rust, lavender, orange, yellow, black, red and blue.</p><p>The Marc look, at least as it appears on his runway, is studiously slapdash, with the designer and his crew creating outfits via faux-casual layerings. A jacket over a cardigan over a T-shirt over jeans over leggings, with a belt, should be a cacophony. The fact that it isn’t is a large part of the line’s charm.</p></div>"
64,fall,2003,f2003,marc-jacobs,"The Marc Jacobs collection is a high point of the show calendar, and not just because the designer's front row is always packed with celebrities (this time: P. Diddy, Liv Tyler, Kristin Davis, Claire Danes, and regulars like Michelle Hicks, Anna Sui, and Helena Christensen). Jacobs has firmly established himself as fashion's bellwether, with an audience that looks to him to pluck out the prevailing trends and decree them relevant.</p><p>This season, Jacobs is clearly feeling very mod. His show, set to churning punk rock (X-Ray Spex's ""Oh Bondage"" kicked off the soundtrack), was a color-splashed paean to pop, with overt references to the sixties space-age designs of Courrèges, Paco Rabanne, and Rudi Gernreich. Minidresses and jumpers in various patchwork combinations of orange, blue, beige, white, pink, violet, and red came dashing down the runway, detailed with felted seams and circle pockets and worn with contrasting hose and sweet little pumps. His silver fur-trimmed parka and boxy wool jackets are destined to displace the peacoat as next season's must-have outerwear.</p><p>Even the evening looks kept the beat. Jacobs showed black and white satin minis with piped seams, as well as a few literally swinging dresses featuring ropes of giant sequins or slashed fabric sewn into a drooping bell. It was cheerful and chock-full of energy and color; but all the literal references to past fashions verged on re-creation, rather than the renewal for which Jacobs is justly famous.</p></div>"
65,fall,2003,f2003,marni,"Where have all the flowers gone? The fall breeze has blown the faded roses clean out of the Marni garden, leaving something sharper, shorter and chicer in their place. Consuelo Castiglioni shifted her scene this season, away from country-house antiquey fabrics toward an artsy reinterpretation of late-’60s retro.</p><p>Her eclectic bohemians have forsaken their wispy layers for high brown leather boots, smart knee-length shorts and minidresses in Sonia Delaunay–esque prints. Everything Marni looks more finished—literally. Instead of raw edges, the curving inside-out seams on dresses and tweed patchwork mélanges were outlined in satin binding. The late-’60s feel came from the off-key spectrum of pinks, browns, royal blue, chrome yellow and strange greens (a color chart that is becoming standard for fall) and cute little items like bibbed pinafores.</p><p>Most strikingly, the covert luxe that has always been an undercurrent of the Marni trademark turned overt. Fox shrugs and lightweight chubbies and the cool, slightly distressed green leather jackets and coats had a glamour that put the collection in step with seasonal trend. Marni devotees—a style tribe used to wending their own alternative ways—are about to wake up and find they're in fashion. But will they miss their flowers?</p></div>"
66,fall,2003,f2003,martin-grant,"Australian-born Martin Grant, whose shop in the Marais district has long been a haunt for fashion insiders like Naomi Campbell, put on a charming, well-edited show with the youthful but wistful elegance we’ve seen this season in collections like Rochas by Olivier Theyskens and Proenza Schouler. With smart little dresses, slim coats and detail-rich skirts, Grant, like those other young designers, makes grateful, and graceful, reference to the past. But he's not anchored to it: bell sleeves on jersey tops whispered classic Saint Laurent, while a three-quarter-length suede coat was subtly ’70s.</p><p>Despite the historical allusions, Grant showed a modern collection for modern girls. The updated Twiggy silhouette that feels so right this season was there, done in bronze and gold cotton and Lurex. There were cape-backed tops—another key look of the moment—and grosgrain ribbon trims that kept things very <em>jeune fille.</em> A beautifully embroidered tulle skirt managed to make ethnic details look refined.</p><p>These are truly ladylike clothes, polished and sexy but with refreshing hints of irony. Motorcycle-leather topstitching saved gold satin tops from appearing too precious, while crinoline skirts, hugely full and poufed in the back, created an edgy profile. It was all <em>trés chic, tr#233;s parisienne,</em> and it left some in the audience comparing Grant to Charles James—no small compliment.</p></div>"
67,fall,2003,f2003,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon’s collection latched onto some of the avant-garde trends that are currently orbiting planet fashion. Plaid, Lurex, zippers, off-kilter color combinations and collaged piecings of oddly matched fabric were worked into a show whose loose theme was punk-meets-sci-fi.</p><p>Sitbon started with black plaid sparkle-shot coats, cut away over short, dippy asymmetrical skirts made of bits of layered tulle and other fabrics. Then she did complex things with striped knits in gray, black, white, yellow and red, overlaying them with curvy corded bands, in patterns that mimicked the shape of ethnic vests. There were gray satin bombers, utility-pocketed skirts and anoraks decorated with red sequin strips made to suggest harnesses.</p><p>The designer followed up with a lot of garments that looked as if they’d been chopped up and adapted from other pieces of clothing, then ended with jackets that featured zippered-in sleeves and some distressed silver space-man leather. The trouble was that Sitbon’s ideas came across as derivative and somewhat dreary, while the intelligent feminine design that usually characterizes her shows was nowhere to be seen.</p></div>"
68,fall,2003,f2003,matthew-williamson,"Well, Britney may have been a no-show this year, but Michael Jackson made an appearance, via a mix in the soundtrack that accompanied Matthew Williamson's fall show, “Bubblegum Superstar” —“‘Bubblegum,’” said Williamson, “because there was a lot of pink, and ‘superstar’ because the clothes were sexy and showy, not clothes that you can hide behind.”</p><p>Williamson himself has never been one to hide from color, and this season was no exception. Flared corduroy pants and very mini skirts were worn with fluorescent stilettos by Christian Louboutin and neon belts fastened, for a change, at the nape of the back. Prints were much in evidence, from the vintage Missoni-like patterns that opened the show to the series of richly hued, Eastern-inspired bird prints that closed it. There was no shortage of decorative elements, either, from sweaters with passementerie embellishments to a series of very covetable fur-trimmed jackets. And if Williamson flirted with an electroclash vibe—via jackets decorated with shiny metallic studs, stars and grommets—the quality of his craftsmanship helped him avoid a reductive retro groove.</p></div>"
69,fall,2003,f2003,max-mara,"If you’re going to invest in a major coat, why should it be boring? That was the question that MaxMara, the Italian powerhouse that founded its fortune on making outerwear for generations of women, answered for fall. The collection offered lots of tempting topcoat propositions, featuring modern cuts that looked current without trying too hard to be trendy.</p><p>MaxMara’s strategies for a new but wearable fall look were in step with ideas instigated in New York at Narciso Rodriguez and Proenza Schouler: either base everything on skinny leggings worn mid-heel with slingbacks, or pull on the season’s crucial over-the-knee boots. Shapes that go over that slim line can then assume new volumes and textures without overwhelming the body.</p><p>The newest concept on display was a caped jacket or coat, sometimes done in leather, chicly fused with a speckled tweed lining. In a canny nod toward menswear-for-women (another key notion emerging for fall), the classic double-breasted coat was eased up and oversized, while more sporty looks came courtesy of cashmere bombers with ribbed welts, leather gilets and big, orange down-filled parkas. Low-slung, egg-shaped hipster skirts and a hugely oversize gray knit sweater worn as a dress, meanwhile, offered around-town options that—just for a change—made absolutely no reference to the ’60s. And for that, working women of the world give thanks.</p></div>"
70,fall,2003,f2003,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors is at his best when he allows a little edge to cut through his luxurious sensibility. The collection he showed for fall, rife with references to biker leathers and tough-but-sexy chicks, had just the right blend of rock ’n’ roll energy and urban sophistication.</p><p>In his notes, Kors mentioned the go-go world of Warhol in the ’60s, but the collection was refreshingly free of retro references—unless you count the legions of tight little minis he sent out, in cashmere, crocodile and stretchy wools. (The best of all, a marvelous piece of walnut-brown fringed suede, was worn—like no one else can—by Naomi Campbell.) Kors paired these, or smart, skinny pants, with great oversized toppers of all genres: giant satin jean jackets, studded black leather styles, slouchy anoraks with fur trim and generous reefers and bathrobe coats made from plush cashmere or mink. For night, he stitched bands of silvery fringe onto skirts and dresses, and ended with a dazzling, glittery disco-ball of a dress on Carmen—perfect for frugging the night away at Ondine's</p></div>"
71,fall,2003,f2003,missoni,"Even before the show started, there was a lot of cross-generational action on the Missoni runway. Seventies supermodel Pat Cleveland and her 13-year-old daughter Anna Van Ravenstein—both dressed top to toe in wiggly Missoni knits—cavorted for photographers with Margherita, daughter of designer Angela Missoni. It all signaled the recharged energy of this family-owned house, which is getting ready for a 50th-anniversary celebration.</p><p>The ’60s are in the air, and there's no harm at all in revisiting them—especially when you’re a house that has some direct experience with the decade. It's perfect timing: Angela Missoni, who is preparing a fashion show of her parents' designs for September, said, ""I was looking through all the things in our archive, so I was thinking that way anyway."" For fall she took swirly browns, blues, yellows, emeralds and turquoises and styled them into Cardin-esque minidresses and the patterned knit coats that are giving Missoni a rejuvenated relevance.</p><p>Angela Missoni is smart enough to contemporize the label's appeal beyond the signature jazzy pattern. She showed how the knits and print satin blouses can be worn maybe with a great boot-leg pant in bright yellow or look fab with a pink fur thrown on top. She also sent out a hit from the archives: a minidress knitted in overlapping petals of colored Lurex, first done in 1966. Not great for the grannies and mommies, perhaps, but just perfect for those leggy teens currently making the Missoni scene.</p></div>"
72,fall,2003,f2003,miu-miu,"If Miu Miu is Prada's kid sister, she's squaring up for a bout of sibling rivalry for fall. She's all grown up, and she wants the tweeds and the furs and the raincoats—and the posh croc bag with the head scarf tied to it. If big sis is getting into menswear, she'll have a piece of that, too, and some of those silk dresses and gloves for good measure.</p><p>The Miu Miu act isn't a literal duplication of the main line, of course, but it catches the same spirit of classic dressing, inheriting quite a few of Prada's greatest hits, as well as some cuter fillips. The fur tippets from Prada's famous ’40s collection reappeared here, twisted into scarves and capes. The house styling trick of cinching a waist with an unmatched leather belt turned up on coats, cardigans and dresses. Last winter's great rubberized mac and tweedy pencil skirts made an encore too.</p><p>This collection is all about filling shops with inexpensive, fast-moving items, and even if a lot of the ideas are Prada recycling her own vintage design, it's still apace with her current thinking. It doesn't give the thought-through luxe of its elder, but it does have witty ways of imitating. Instead of a full fur lining inside a sweater or jacket, an extended furry collar is tucked inside things to fake the effect. There's the key gauntlet glove, but in gray mohair knit, not croc. Good buys abound: well-cut mannish suits, wing-tip shoes and eye-catching pink or red houndstooth coats. As Miuccia Prada has always asserted, Miu Miu isn't a watered-down diffusion line. These sisters know when to share and when not to—so everyone goes home happy.</p></div>"
73,fall,2003,f2003,moschino,"To the strains of Madonna’s “Holiday” and “Like a Virgin,” a parade of Park Avenue punk princesses strolled down the Moschino runway, which was lit by a disco ball and a border of lightbulbs suggesting a diva’s dressing-room mirror.</p><p>The raunchy Moschino gals, as imagined by creative director Rossella Jardini and designer Vincent Darré, looked like early-’80s wannabe-starlets—the kind once featured in Andy Warhol’s <em>Interview,</em> the kind who ransacked their mothers’ closets in search of vintage glamour. Luxe mink-trimmed and jet-beaded satin evening jackets and coats were accessorized with jewels that might have been scooped up at random from momma’s dressing table. These bourgeois props were mixed with short ’50s prom petticoats in nylon tulle (blowing their coat skirts to pneumatic proportions) and satin ski pants. Patent Courrèges-style go-go boots and Rubik’s Cube eyewear rounded out a look that was just right for storming Studio 54 or braving the Mudd Club.</p><p>The ’80s-’60s clash is a strong trend this season, and the Moschino design team married it well to the house's spirit of jokey classics. Paco Rabanne–inspired dresses were made from large discs seemingly cut out of “Moschino” beer cans, while mohair tunic sweaters were belted in patent leather. (Lightbulb earrings, on the other hand, did not come across as the brightest idea on the block.) Born actresses Natasha Vojnovic and Rie Rasmussen led the Material Girls for the finale, vamping it up à la Janice Dickinson and Pat Cleveland.</p></div>"
74,fall,2003,f2003,narciso-rodriguez,"More streamlined than a Jaguar and perhaps even better at handling curves—that was Narciso Rodriguez’s gorgeous fall show, where the designer showed once again that cool and sexy can coexist in one collection.</p><p>Rodriguez continued with the long, lean silhouette he showed in the spring, using rigorously precise cutting and tailoring to sculpt form-fitting dresses and suits. There were great examples of his whip-thin, athletic dresses, done in black or white with geometric accents detailing the hips and shoulders, as well as beautiful suits with skirts or slim pants that came just to the ankle. And while the lines were spare, there was luxury built into each piece, such as when the designer combined two or three fabrics in one outfit—velvet, silk and marocain, for example—for a play of textures.</p><p>In a week where a lot of time has been spent looking back at the past, it was refreshing to see a show that had virtually no retro references; although clearly schooled in minimalism, Rodriguez has a fashion vocabulary all his own. He has also loosened up, just a bit. The silhouette had a bit more swing, in the form of a flaring black velour coat and some mesmerizingly floaty hems on a few dresses and skirts. His evening pieces were dazzlingly simple: cool columns of chiffon, matte silk and marocain, done in white or, for the last number, the coolest lavender silk, which breezed off the runway like a beautiful memory.</p></div>"
75,fall,2003,f2003,nicole-farhi,"Long-established French designer Nicole Farhi lives in London and has a network of boutiques founded in partnership with her ex-husband, Stephen Marks, the owner of FCUK and a senior figure in the British fashion industry. Together they have a reputation as purveyors of the acceptable face of British style—clothes capable of traveling the Atlantic with an even chance of being understood by the American public.</p><p>Farhi thinks of wardrobe options rather than sweeping collection statements or runway theatrics, and many British women rely on the attainable, everyday luxury of her sportswear. One of the label’s strengths is outerwear, which carried through for fall in a variety of neat-to-the-body coats and jackets, often trimmed with deep fur collars. Reversed rabbit-skin coats and distressed-leather jackets with puffy poacher pockets exude just the right note of casual confidence for busy female executives.</p><p>Farhi’s up-to-the-minute formulas—cropped pants and leather boots; a flippy pleated chiffon skirt worn with opaque tights—are timeless fall options for women who simply want to look right without trying too hard. Life is complicated enough as it is.</p></div>"
76,fall,2003,f2003,nicole-miller,"While it sometimes may seem the world is awash in clothes, finding examples with the right mix of sophistication and practicality can be remarkably difficult. That’s where Nicole Miller has made her reputation, and her fall collection shows her continued ability to meet that challenge.</p><p>The first part of her presentation included body-conscious jersey and satin dresses, tops and miniskirts in muted green, mocha, plum and black, and shaped by shirred panels. All these looks, including a pretty green shearling coat embroidered with a deco peacock-feather motif, were flattering and easy on the eyes, if not terribly new.</p><p>Miller made a more individual statement with a series of party dresses. The designer demonstrated her eye for balancing glitz with wearability, putting just a few deco touches on her ’20s-esque flapper shifts and dropping down the neckline of a red gown—but not too, too far. And her sparkly bouclé coat was a prime example of Miller at her best: smart enough for day, cool enough for night.</p></div>"
77,fall,2003,f2003,oscar-de-la-renta,"All the current talk of a return to ladylike fashion must strike Oscar de la Renta as pretty amusing. While other designers pick up and drop influences each season, de la Renta has been buffing and polishing his part-fantasy, part-practical sportswear approach for decades. Elegance is his native tongue.</p><p>For fall, de la Renta's daywear took a distinctly cozy turn. He started off with plush, plum-colored cashmere knits paired with cool brown suede or cashmere flannel and sometimes trimmed with sable. He took brocade, one of the most tradition-bound fabrics in the lexicon, and cut it into jazzy, fitted little cocktail dresses. He also sent out some austerely beautiful evening dresses, several seductive variations on his signature ruffled party confections, and suits that will last through the decade, never mind the season.</p><p>Where the designer was clearly having fun, though, was in shuffling together day and evening looks: de la Renta paired a taupe cashmere tank with an airy black taffeta skirt, put a chubby fox fur vest over gold silk brocade crop pants, and tossed one of his princely embellished coats atop slim trousers and a simple silk blouse. Both comfortable to wear and delightful to look at, this is the kind of elegance that only comes with experience.</p></div>"
78,fall,2003,f2003,paul-smith,"Sir Paul Smith hasn’t put on airs and graces since receiving his knighthood, though he’s London’s most financially successful designer. When he turns his attention to women’s wear, however, his clothes always look like the work of a cheeky lad out to charm the cleverest girl at art school into bed.</p><p>For fall, he gathered ideas during a whistle-stop world tour that started in Moscow and ended in New York, where he saw an exhibit of Russian Constructivist book design. The latter inspired the thread-trailing disk-and-stripe appliqu¿s on the frayed tweeds that opened the show, and throughout the collection he used geometric or leaf prints—although in a post-revolutionary palette of yellow, green, pink and black—to unify his theme. This was no propaganda overhaul, though. Smith can’t resist tinkering with his old favorites: school uniforms, delinquent debutantes’ partywear and the lexicon of gentleman’s attire on which he founded his name.</p><p>Those appeared this season as dippy asymmetric raw-edged kilts, striped school blazers and scarves, vaguely ’30s satin print dresses and embroidered kimonos suitable for a sexy intellectual. Occasionally the collection took a turn into corporate branding, as when his signature swirly print appeared in chiffon and chain-mail dresses or branched off disconcertingly into embroidered black leather. The most amusing moment came when Sir Paul sent out his men’s shirts, buttoned all askew and back to front, with sleeves knotted to mimic bustles or thrown over the shoulder like a one-strap dress. It was a vision of morning-after wear in the bedroom of the (evidently successful) boyfriend.</p></div>"
79,fall,2003,f2003,peter-som,"Trends may come and trends may go, but there is always room for well-made sportswear classics. Which is where Peter Som comes in; only a few seasons into his career, the 32-year-old designer has developed a following for clothes that are lighthearted but still luxurious.</p><p>Som has an eye for fabrics that can stand on their own, from light, spongy bouclé tweeds to a crinkly gold-foil-embossed knit to a liquid mercury satin. The colors, like charcoal gray, toffee brown, ivory and pink, were subtle and appealing, and the shapes were mostly simple and straightforward: A-line skirts, shirtdresses, trousers cut trim but not tight, jackets that hit flatteringly at the hip. The designer added interest by tweaking one or two elements in each outfit—shaping a floating chiffon skirt with rows of bias pin tucks, or finishing off a soft gray mohair suit with bishop sleeves. Som scattered fox fur through the collection, adding long cuffs to a slim gray sweater and topping off a few outfits with giant wraps. He got ahead of himself a few times, as with a two-piece charmeuse outfit that had more twisting and tucking than a gymnastic event. And culottes are rarely, if ever, flattering. But overall, Som’s easy cool is making a justified name for itself.</p></div>"
80,fall,2003,f2003,pierrot,"By dedicating himself exclusively to knitwear, the French-born, New York–based designer Pierrot starts out with some pretty serious limits to his medium. After all, how many ways are there to work a knitting needle or a crochet hook? Fortunately for his audience, Pierrot is a showman as well as a craftsman, and he makes every stitch tell a story.</p><p>This season, he sent out a collection that referenced (in roughly chronological order) German Expressionism, Russian Constructivism, Mondrian, Pop and Op art, and Japanese pop culture. There were cardigans in soft colors paired with crocheted skirts; witty, bold wrap dresses and red sweaters with “Pierrot” spelled out in faux-cyrillic script; off-the-shoulder tops decorated with Warholian bananas; and pretty, poppy-scattered twinsets in vivid blue, all shown on models who gleefully vamped and jived for the audience. (Designer Benjamin Cho and transgender personality Amanda Lepore made guest appearances.)</p><p>In addition to the artsy showcase pieces, the designer turned out simple, pretty cable sweaters and skirts, turtlenecks, and sweater coats. In fact, with the addition of menswear to his label, Pierrot will now be hard-pressed to find a customer he can’t put in a knit.</p></div>"
81,fall,2003,f2003,prada,"When the going gets tough, no one can cut an argument for great design with as much substance, conviction and richness of intelligence as Miuccia Prada. Using an unlikely mix of potentially dowdy British tweeds and men’s shirting, bright, lustrous William Morris prints, humble lining silks and deluxe furs and skins, she performed sheer alchemy to create a vision of high chic for hard times.</p><p>Prada started by introducing a new cut—a funnel-neck coat with a yoke shoulder and raised, belted waist. Then she eked sexiness out of striped men’s shirts, pinstripe pants and pencil skirts in windowpane suiting fabric by showing them with satin platform slingbacks and a soupçon of the undone. A shirt came with a chopped-off raw sleeve. A black alligator coat was worn over just a shirt and a long, mannish sweater, looking as though the wearer had somehow forgotten her skirt—but fabulous just the same. Accessorized though they were to the last detail, with gloves and the season’s boxy bags hanging from leather and metal chains, the outfits all had an air of elegant off-hand improvisation.</p><p>Part of this collection’s genius is that it has continuity <em>and</em> ingenuity: all the hallmarks of Miuccia Prada's talent are on show. Take the way she has of ordaining the peculiar as newly desirable. This season it’s Willam Morris–by–way–of–Liberty flower prints, used as formfitting knee-length dresses, shirts and a deerstalker hat. Or her way of letting the uptight formality out of eveningwear with form-skimming dresses in unpressed lining silks or crinkled georgette, shown with fabric neck pieces (a continuation of Spring’s beaded jewelry). Visually and intellectually, this is a collection that hit the high notes. Post-show, Prada explained her endeavor to be “a desperate search for beauty as we wait for war.” Bad times or no, it's fashion guaranteed to make women desperate to shop.</p></div>"
82,fall,2003,f2003,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Respect for Preen, which has made its mark on the map of London street chic, is on the rise. This collection, called Protection, had a tough attitude—almost Belgian in its intensity—but managed to march to its own beat. The basic idea was layering, all in a spectrum of urban gray and industrial metallics. The silhouette—if that’s not too pretentious a term for this form of gutter elegance—was put together from tight, belted tweed jackets worn as short coats, thick rib-knit, Lurex-flecked tunics, and double or triple layerings of blousons or billowing raincoats over frilled skirts. The unifying device of leather boots or leggings gave the look a skinny swagger, meaning that the attenuated body line never got lost among the tiers.</p><p>Bringing a low-key design interest to the staples of everyday dressing, Preen recast urban utilitywear as marly sweats, leg-hugging suede cargo pants and ribbed tanks, cut away and worn in multiples. So Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi can rethink cut and beat-up fabric with the best of them, but what sets them apart from the pack is knowing when to stop short of turning clothes into intellectual statements. This couple entered fashion not by staging showy runway coups but—with refreshing unconventionality—by building a business steadily from the small shop they opened in Portobello Green in 1996. That all means that Preen knows how to design stuff they’ll actually sell. With seven years under their belt, they’re almost setting a record for longevity in business among young London designers.</p></div>"
83,fall,2003,f2003,proenza-schouler,"Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez presented their first major collection at the National Arts Club this season, courtesy, in part, of the Ecco Domani Foundation and <em>Vogue</em>. Both Parsons graduates, the duo came up by way of jobs at Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively, and named their label after their mothers. The clothes they showed, though, were as far from matronly as possible—chic, sophisticated and new.</p><p>Models with “just back from a party” silver-dipped lids paraded through the club in slouchy jackets, legging-slim pants and beautifully cut bustier tops with racing backs. The tightly focused collection was rendered in a muted palette of mostly black and charcoal, and it conjured a distinctly cinematic feel: a heroine slinking through a smoky Paris (or New York) evening, her legs lengthened by black patent stilettos extending out from under a cocoony jacket that falls suggestively off her shoulder.</p><p>What marked the collection as American was the duo’s focus on transforming basic wardrobe staples into desirable luxury items. “Long johns” were worked in black silk, and leather coats were painted white and trimmed at the collar with raccoon. Even the humble hoodie got a new life when paired with a pencil skirt and black cashmere bolero on Ann Catherine and worn, by Danielle Zinaich, under a sleeveless coat with Fred Leighton diamonds. More accessible sparkle was offered by way of Proenza Schouler’s sequin, satin and metallic gauze bustiers, which drew appreciative looks from an audience that included Isaac Mizrahi, Debbie Harry and a heavy-duty array of top editors and retailers.</p></div>"
84,fall,2003,f2003,ralph-lauren,"Maybe it was just coincidence that Ralph Lauren chose to show his Fall collection in Manhattan’s Chelsea area, in a light-filled art gallery with rustic bleachers and exposed beams. Ever the Anglophile, Lauren’s collection was full of references to the other Chelsea, in London, where the rich and bohemian have thrived for decades.</p><p>With early Bob Dylan and Rolling Stones setting a retro-counterculture mood, Lauren sent out elegantly tailored pieces that underscored his ability to transpose menswear into a feminine key. He cut trim little jackets and slim pants from mossy tweeds, and made nut-brown suede into cool motorcycle jackets worn over fluttering satin skirts. A nod to dandyism showed through in a green plaid overcoat worn with a velvet shirt and tie, and plummy velvet suits—perfect for the modern-day bluestocking. For evening, Lauren went full-on feminine, via a series of icy-cool pieces touched with silvery beading. His white charmeuse top over black velvet leggings is just the thing for a chic dinner party, while a night out on the town (or on the red carpet) demands one of his snowy white satin columns—topped with a suitably funky black motocross jacket.</p></div>"
85,fall,2003,f2003,rick-owens,"""Who doesn't want to come to Paris if they're a designer?"" said Rick Owens. ""It's the ultimate place."" Right. Putting on a show in the City of Light exposes a designer to an international audience—and the competition's fiercest glare. Even though Owens has been building a following out of L.A. for years, this collection represented the official breakthrough onto the world stage for his strong but subtle goth aesthetic.</p><p>Owens's supple, beat-up skins and fine layers of crinkled cr¿pe and knit have become cult items over the past couple of years, partly thanks to the way they mix with other clothes and pack so well. For fall, he showed gutsy updates on the asymmetric drapey layering, big, sloppy ribbed knits and distressed-leather looks that are coveted by his horde of traveling warrior women. His jackets—either small and narrow-sleeved or hefty and voluminous—were his star pieces, both done with the big collars that are showing up everywhere this season. A couple of dramatic post-apocalyptic parkas had a shaggy fringe of stuffing spilling from the edge, and a new body-fitting jacket was pieced together in zones of oyster and black pleated distressed satin. Alongside these, Owens recut his signature jacket—high in back, tapering to a point in front—in shearling.</p><p>The collection's news came in the the washed-out baby blue and pink tones that cropped up among the familiar blacks and browns, as well as the thigh-high boots that marched out on flat soles. As a total look, though, nothing much in the Owens universe has changed. His stylistic niche happens to slot in somewhere near the Belgian sensibility; as a Paris debut, it held its own with credibility.</p></div>"
86,fall,2003,f2003,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli set his raucous show against a giant wall of video screens that bore an uncanny resemblance to the ones Sean Combs installed for his New York presentation—where Cavalli himself was a surprise guest. The imagery evoked a dreamy futuristic metropolis out of <em>Blade Runner,</em> but as the pace quickened and the soundtrack throbbed ever louder, it segued into heady images of Hollywood red-carpet awards ceremonies, the Rio carnival and Las Vegas showgirl acts. These are, perhaps, among the select venues where a girl can carry off such raucous Cavalli-isms as a trained hourglass leather dress, cut and decorated like a motocross biker’s jacket. Or a sweeping black Cruella De Vil mink coat with a giant white eagle flapping across the back, worn over a barely there mermaid gown, blown together on a wing and a prayer with the help of myriad black sequins the size of licorice candies.</p><p>The Cavalli girl clearly exists on a plane far removed from common humanity, but there was a giddily seductive let-them-eat-cake bravado to the designer’s madness. He even surfed some of the current trends: ’60s op-art prints; a dash of ’80s punk, in the hand-beaded “graffiti” on skinny-leg jeans and the chunky dog-collar chokers worn with over-the-top rhinestones; the second-skin boot cut crotch-high; and a great take on the season’s ubiquitous crystal-beaded, fringed flapper dress (perfect for a New Age Roxie Hart).</p><p>But the designer was at his most persuasive when he laid claim to escapist Bob Mackie territory with Jayne Mansfield siren gowns in lamé chiffons and a frothy ostrich- and cock-feather bubble coat worn over a Tina Turner sequined mini. Even his classically tailored, shapely jackets were slashed at the sides, his shearling flying jackets cropped short over midriff-baring dresses. As Jacquetta Wheeler swept off the runway in a Moulin Rouge showgirl costume that left little to the imagination (but a whole flock of apricot ostrich plumes in her wake), the rest of Cavalli’s glamazons pranced out wearing Lycra catsuits in vivid Warhol- and Basquiat-inspired prints. Don’t ask me where they’re heading—just make sure to invite me along for the ride.</p></div>"
87,fall,2003,f2003,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens, the prodigiously talented young Belgian, returned to the Paris scene to make his debut at Rochas and bowled over his audience with a show that was nothing short of magnificent. Having leafed through the annals of 1950s Parisian elegance, Theyskens proceeded to redefine the romance of the suit, cocktail dress and grand evening gown in exquisite couture-grade materials, making them relevant for a whole new generation.</p><p>Magical constructions of black Chantilly lace, pink and white taffeta, satin and tulle were melded into shapes and volumes with a dual impact: a respect for the past and the forceful confidence of youth. Tiny skirt suits with narrow shoulders were made in four-tiered silhouettes, consisting of a bolero with a flounce beneath it, then a skirt with another whoosh at the hemline. The spectacular part was in the back, though. Sometimes a frill would start in the sleeve and carry on around the back in a caped furl; other times there was padding or a big bow hidden under lace, which created a swaybacked line unseen since the work of Cristobal Balenciaga.</p><p>Fragile, camisole-strapped satin dresses came with rounded bell skirts, petticoated with tulle; other delicately ingenious variations included pencil skirts with spirals of hacked tulle at the waist or constructed entirely out of what looked like white rose petals. Then came the breathtakingly statuesque entrance-making gowns. One standout came in pink taffeta covered with black Chantilly lace, cut close to the torso but bursting into undulations at the shoulder and below the knee. Throughout, Theyskens threw in details just odd enough to keep predictability at bay: plastic see-through pumps, hand-painted abstract flowers, a jolt of orange leather, a royal-blue glove.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""72h9df""></div></div><p>It was ravishing. By the end Theyskens had wrought a small revolution—a decisive shift in taste away from the worn-out provocations of edgy and sexual. In 20 minutes he’d blown the dust off the words <em>charming</em> and <em>dainty</em> and ushered in a whole new concept of feminine elegance and sophistication.</p></div>"
88,fall,2003,f2003,roland-mouret,"In London, Roland Mouret has become a top name intent on pulling clear of the reputation for amateurism that plagues many of the city’s formative talents. This season, in pursuit of that goal, he embraced the ’60s Courrèges-Cardin groove that’s already surfaced in New York, basing his leggy show around mod minis, space-age cutouts, black, orange and lashings of patent leather. Citing <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> and <em>Metropolis</em> as his references, he sent out a collection that proved he can make clothes with a clean-cut quality, but left a question-mark hanging over a more essential point: the coherence of his personal vision.</p><p>Mouret showed precise little raised-waist wool coats and suits with collars, pocket flaps, tabs and half-belts picked out in black patent leather. His sequence of A-line minidresses, some flipped in the hem, had curvy keyhole leather-banded motifs at the neck, or were completely suspended from complex patent harnesses, Barbarella-style. Fluted knit dresses done in vertical stripes of plain and sheer stitching, floating over an opaque base, seemed softer and more modern. For evening, he switched to pale gray and edged the banded keyholes in pretty, iridescent silver sequin.</p><p>The collection was proof that Mouret can produce a grown-up, pulled-together look with a lot of commercially viable elements, especially the outerwear. The problem was that the empire-line coats seemed to move in the slipstream of Marc Jacobs, and the cutout dresses in the wake of Sophia Kokosalaki’s experiments. Meanwhile, the romantically draped dresses that have become Mouret’s signature were missing. That’s a pity, since they represent his best chance at rising above the crowd.</p></div>"
89,fall,2003,f2003,saint-laurent,"“Color! Fashion! I love it!” said Tom Ford backstage after a show that ended the Fall season in a climax of exuberant, sophisticated, grown-up sexiness. He was looking back, to the 1940s collection that Saint Laurent designed in the ’70s, but also moving things forward, and he hit exactly the right balance with his first outfit: a soft jade silk-velvet jacket, fastened at the side with a satin ribbon, over a flouncy knee-length skirt in a paler green and fishnets finished by Lucite-heeled ankle-strap shoes.</p><p>Ford shook off the muted, slightly tortured mood of his last collection and embraced the vibrant, daring color clashes Saint Laurent used so often—cranberry and red, brown and pale blue, powder pink and black, and the odd vulgar sparkly heeled emerald shoe to throw everything off a bit. He had fun with the idea of Saint Laurent fur by exaggerating the sleeves on a fox coat, dangling whole tails from the wrists and belting it with a stiff plastic bow. That plastic also came out on evening gowns as see-through breastplates and cuffs glittering with diamanté.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>But that’s not to say this was a complete change of direction. The slinky flippy skirts he showed under jackets last season were the beginning of a train of thought that here flowered into gorgeous ruffles, exposed black lingerie, fur chubbies and a cascade of long evening gowns. Adding to the mood of happy nostalgia, meanwhile, was a red-lipped Karen Elson—her red hair done in a pageboy—black models with afros and a soundtrack courtesy of Diana Ross and the Supremes.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""p3qpln""></div></div><p>So what made this twenty-first-century Tom and not 1970s Yves? The way Ford knocked the stuffing out of what had become an ossified conservative look with a series of cheeky, knowing twists. There’s nothing ladylike about silk-chiffon dresses that are so sheer you can see straight through to the fishnets beneath. About a blouse neckline that dips below the bra. Or the lace-filled cutouts he planted into the flanks of a pair of black leather pants. (If that puts him in line for criticism, it’s worth remembering that once upon a time Saint Laurent himself came under fire for so-called bad taste.) Simply put, there was enough beauty and controversy in this collection to make it a talking point—and a money spinner—for the next six months. Which means Tom Ford has done it again.</p></div>"
90,fall,2003,f2003,sonia-rykiel,"After 41 years, it’s amazing how Sonia Rykiel manages to merge her unchanging aesthetic—soft, body-hugging knits in black with bright spots, floppy hats smashed down on the head, and that very French savoir-faire—with whatever’s current in fashion. So for fall, the black things are turning up appropriately proportioned (trans: short) and layered, with leggings under skirts under bustiers. Rykiel also hit the current idea of the big, soft, fun fur done as a huge bubble of color—in her case, purple knitted fox, or teal-blue Mongolian lamb, cinched in with hip-riding belts. The Rykiel trend summary also includes the biker, in its own way: perhaps as a zippy cream skirt suit, or a leather motorcycle jacket with a huge collar in shearling.</p><p>Paris wouldn’t be Paris without Rykiel's traditional finale: dozens of girls lining up on the runway in her signature stripy knits. Fall's editions are tiny off-the-shoulder or tube top and worn with flouncy net tutus. But when the Michael Jackson was cued up, and the girls tried to work up a few awkward dance moves, the upbeat eighties theme took a bad stumble.</p></div>"
91,fall,2003,f2003,sophia-kokosalaki,"Curvy, ivory, anatomically pieced dresses, sometimes overrun with raised top-seaming like contour lines on a map: these were the opening statements by which Sophia Kokosalaki announced a change of direction. For a couple of seasons, the designer has been too caught up with complicated cutouts, strung together with folk-derived macramé from her Greek heritage. Now she’s working out a new way of conveying her distinctive signature, cleaning up silhouettes with her own brand of futurism. A child of the ’80s, Kokosalaki admits that the costumes in <em>Star Trek</em> made an impression on her. Others might connect her latest move with the admiration for Azzedine Alaïa and the Mugler/Montana era that is currently in the air. Either way, what sets her apart is a design integrity that keeps her from making literal reinterpretations.</p><p>For fall, Kokosalaki synthesized the lessons and experiments of her past collections with a cleaner, more body-conscious look. Her cutouts, for instance, were replaced by patches of pleated metallic leather or flattened frills, implanted in necklines or at the hips, so that the motif now reads like a pattern of gilded wings. Further into the show, she developed that idea into a whole leather skirt, done in pleated tiers of copper and pewter leather. The real achievement of this collection, however, was that she never allowed herself to be distracted by the details. Kokosalaki’s strongest stroke was the definition of a concise proportion, cutting all her hemlines—dresses and coats included—to four inches above the knee and rebalancing the silhouette with the tendency to a wider shoulder. Some of her boxy coat-jackets came with military epaulets and were shown with leggings and high boots, others as glamorous edge-to-edge clutch coats with volume in the shoulder line.</p><p>Overall, though, it’s the chic femininity of Kokosalaki’s work—her love of developing form-flattering dresses and the ability to adjust her vision without losing her identity—that marks her out as a fast-maturing talent.</p></div>"
92,fall,2003,f2003,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney sent along rose-colored glasses with the invitations to her show this season, but they really weren't necessary. The charm of her show was visible to the naked eye. Strict tweed pencil skirts worn with blousy cropped satin jackets in pinks and mauves were a modern version of sexy secretary glamour. Ribbed wool trims and tight techno-fiber pants that looked like something you'd see on a snowboarder's half-pipe lent an air of sporty sophistication.</p><p>Models walked to a hip-hoppy remix of ""My Favorite Things,"" in which the mundane yearnings for ""brown paper packages tied up with string"" had been replaced with more glamorous listings: ""diamonds and rubies and Stella's dresses."" That must have referred to the pretty silk cocktail frocks that closed the show. Done in flower-petal colors with rows of pinkie-size crystals, they're surefire candidates to become the favorite things of party girls from London to L.A.</p><p>Yet for all the icy elegance, there was the feeling that something was missing from this collection. Perhaps it was the youthful, cheeky edge that's made the designer a fashion favorite with the kind of woman who will throw an old hoodie sweatshirt over a fresh-off-the-runway dress. This season, with too much tricky Alaïa-inspired tailoring, McCartney seems to be trying too hard. And that, among the seen-it-all crowd that travels in those casually chic circles, is definitely a no-no.</p></div>"
93,fall,2003,f2003,tommy-hilfiger,"A fan of all things British, Tommy Hilfiger has a particular soft spot for the mod era's crisp lines, powerful graphics and great music. That means the current trend for early-’60s fashion plays to his strengths, and the result was a smart, appealing fall collection.</p><p>As the Kinks, the Who and the Beatles played at earsplitting volume, Hilfiger sent out short, white A-line dresses made from space-age materials like neoprene and Teflon, worn with Courreges-inspired flat silver boots and boxy short jackets or mink hoodies. He cut pants tight and seamed, in the style of vintage skiwear, and topped his looks with silvery oversize anoraks, white motorcycle jackets and funnel-neck short coats. Hilfiger also worked plenty of shiny patent leather into the collection, as an accent or in great pieces such as a slick leather car coat and skinny white pants. With two exceptions—a bold red coat and skirt shown at the end—the palette stayed white, black or navy. Hilfiger clearly knows not only the era, but also just how his customer wants it interpreted.</p></div>"
94,fall,2003,f2003,undercover,"Jun Takahashi’s Spring collection left the audience with the impression that the young Japanese designer is a burning rebel with a sociopolitical point to make. So his invitation, printed on cutout figures, had people puzzling over what edgy direction he might take for fall. In the end, though, the concept wasn’t an intellectual mind bender, but the simple conceit of dressing paper dolls.</p><p>The whimsical show started with a pair of girls who wandered out wearing printed tabard dresses with long gloves, hair in off-kilter up-dos, eyes shaded by twisted metal cocktail veils, and lips tinted blue and green. They paused, and then one unfolded half a raw-edged tweed suit and stuck it to the other with Velcro tabs. The stick-on clothes had a suburban ladylikeness, all polka-dot blouses, dressmaker-y frocks and fake-fur coats. These sliced-off secondary outfits got attached to everyday sportswear, like sweats and cargo pants with vast pockets, and accessorized with photo-printed cutouts of necklaces, watches and corsages. It was cute at first, but once it was clear that no further twists were going to develop, the show dragged on a bit.</p><p>“Last season’s theme was very heavy, so I wanted to do something lighter,” Takahashi said afterward. Fall’s idea, and its arty execution, puts him somewhere along the avant-garde continuum that includes Junya Watanabe, Viktor &amp; Rolf and Bernhard Willhelm. Which, after all, is an interesting place to be.</p></div>"
95,fall,2003,f2003,valentino,"Dim nightclub lighting and a dirgelike soundtrack set an uncharacteristically downbeat tone at Valentino and seemed an odd foil to the ladylike clothes on parade. These were strongest when they played with themes from the house’s Spring couture collection and showcased the extraordinary detailing of which even Valentino’s ready-to-wear workrooms are capable.</p><p>There was no shortage of stellar effects. Concentric circles of mink on the bishop sleeve of a shapely jacket suggested an archery target. An evening bodice, worn over a sunburst-pleated satin gown in the designer’s brilliant fetish red, bristled with singly mounted ostrich fronds. Bead embroidery was swagged across cocktail dresses to mimic lavish Edwardian necklaces. And there were plenty of the insouciant gestures that Valentino’s well-heeled customers relish, from the frothy ivory lace-and-chiffon lingerie blouses worn with black cocktail skirts to the marled knit cardigan coat fashioned for a Bloomsbury beauty and shrugged over bohemian ’30s beads. He also caught something of the 1940s spirit that has infused this season’s war-menaced collections. But pleated flippy skirts and neat hourglass jackets, swirled with curlicues of padded satin, evoked a young Duchess of Windsor rather than the sexed-up chanteuse singing “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” that some other designers have taken as their muse.</p><p>As always, Valentino seemed to have an eye on Oscar’s red carpet, sending out siren gowns lavished with pretty Lalique-esque dragonfly embroideries and a showgirl-style flapper costume drenched in lilac bugle beads. It is difficult, however, to imagine where his diva is heading in an overscale chiffon sweater thickly banded with Mongolian lamb—a fondue party in Saint Moritz, perhaps? Then again, if anyone knows the quirks of those lunching ladies, it is Valentino.</p></div>"
96,fall,2003,f2003,vera-wang,"Vera Wang sustained the coolly wistful feeling of her spring show with a lovely Asian-tinged collection for fall.</p><p>Although best known for her evening looks, Wang has clearly been putting some thought into daywear, opening her show with a slim black coat whose three-quarter sleeves and low belt whispered an early ’60s elegance. Other sportswear pieces, like a great ivory goatskin coat, or a black cashmere shell and slim skirt, were judiciously embellished with a glimmer of beads, a bit of swinging passementerie or a bar of origami-folded ribbon. Some were topped with adorable shrugs made from fur or cashmere, or knitted with popcorn. Wang also did long and short versions of sexy silk jersey dresses, including one strappy number she called a bondage dress—although if that's bondage, Debra Messing is a dominatrix.</p><p>The modern dilemma for eveningwear, as recent red carpets have made all too obvious, is how to achieve glamour and sophistication without falling into old-and-fussy or new-and-weird. Wang has that problem solved: A pale-gray chiffon gown, cut in the time-honored plunge-neck style, gets a fresh treatment via raw seams; a high mandarin collar makes a satin dress stand out; and a taupe gown made from the webbiest open-work lace enhances without overwhelming—which could well be this designer’s motto.</p></div>"
97,fall,2003,f2003,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho designs clothes with her fellow women in mind, appealing to a feminine sense of what’s pretty and what works. The result is a refreshing lack of flashy, over-the-top sexiness, a chic, bookish, often delicious decorum holding sway instead. This season was no exception, as Branquinho delivered on all her signature looks: leggings worn with knee-high boots, V-neck cocktail slips, tweedy knee-length skirts, woven crisscross straps and a mostly muted palette.</p><p>She opened the show with a grouping of smartest-girl-at-the-party black dresses, slim pants and inventive overcoats—one with long, loose, knee-skimming sleeves and another that incorporated a structured capelet that hit at the elbow. Things soon lightened up with subtly twinkling rose-petal dresses, which, Branquinho said later, were inspired by her recent fascination with ice-dancing competitions. They then loosened up via chunky toggle-closure cardigans and knee-length pleated kilts that recalled the <em>Love Story</em>–era Ali MacGraw. Highly covetable windowpane-plaid shirtdresses had an equally ’70s collegiate feel; they conjured visions of a longhaired grad student throwing on one of her boyfriend’s well-worn button-downs and cinching it with a folksy leather belt before heading off to her advanced existentialism seminar.</p><p>What distinguished this collection from Branquinho past, however, was the higher level of elegance. There was a new sparkle—in the black dresses embroidered with silver thread, in the shimmering Lurex ballerina sweaters and in the thin jersey tops painted with gleaming platinum flames. It was as if the intellectual Belgian had taken a well-deserved break from her studies to hit the disco—or, at least, the skating rink.</p></div>"
98,fall,2003,f2003,versace,"Donatella Versace's strong suit is just that: her slim, mean tailoring for the rock-star wife who has graduated to a more sophisticated phase of her life. She's moved beyond road trips and hanging around backstage; now she lives uptown and drops the kids off at school in the limo, on her way to a day of lunch and shopping.</p><p>Maybe she’s settling down, but she still wants her style with some attitude. Versace knows how to do that. She loves a wild Western fringe or a big, mad dyed fur, but she can also take care of the more quotidian needs of the rock and celebrity aristocracy. She cuts a fine beige pantsuit, a white pencil skirt and a belted caramel coat with distinction, and throws in an oversize squashy ostrich bag as an enough-said status accessory. About-town daywear can also include an amped-up couture-detailed biker jacket, maybe in pink leather or black satin, with patches of ribbing and crisscross lacing on the sleeve and up the back.</p><p>At night, of course, there's bound to be a red carpet or two. Versace's solutions came in multiple variations of the knockout corset dress. In strong color, like absinthe or red, or more muted ivory and lingerie pink, they were boned and fitted like a second skin, trailing cascades of chiffon in the skirts. Still, even her dresses couldn't distract from the impact of another idea: a definitive tux, lean in the jacket and with the skinniest possible pants. It's the kind of simple, powerful statement that separates the women from the girls.</p></div>"
99,fall,2003,f2003,versus-versace,"Hair ratted into an insane mane, body poured into a multicolor repertoire of spray-on pieces, the Versus chick has morphed into an outrageous cyber-biker on speed. Donatella Versace calls her prot¿g¿’s look “sophisticated toughness with couture references and a nod to Hells Angels and motocross daredevils.” She’s out there high-stepping through the fall trends—leggings, cycle jackets, anatomically-constructed patchworks of color—in bright leather and satin spiky boots laden with chains.</p><p>Her revved-up day-time wardrobe runs to sculptured jackets with second-skin jersey leggings or tight microminidresses with patches of turquoise, royal blue and white, or clashes of orange, pink and cranberry pieced together like a speed cyclist's suit. Sometimes she'll throw in the odd alternative moment via a few pseudo-proper black bouclé coats, but that’s just a passing fancy. This girl hits her stride somewhere way after midnight, and a silver leather coat banded with yellow fur and matching gauntlets will get her exactly where she wants to be: way, way beyond.</p></div>"
100,fall,2003,f2003,viktor-rolf,"Copper-haired and milk-pale, British actress Tilda Swinton appeared at Viktor &amp; &amp; Rolf in a slightly different role from her usual turn. As designer muse, Swinton strolled down the runway in a black pantsuit with a deep, swooping curve of a collar to the soundtrack of her own cut-glass voice advising, “Follow your own path.” That was the opening scene of a return performance of the Dutch double-act's finest ideas, distilled over a decade. ""It's our tenth anniversary already,"" said Viktor Horsting. ""We wanted to do all our signatures, with the menswear and the couture influences, for an ageless modern woman.""</p><p>By focusing on dressing Tilda—an army of Tildas, in fact—the collection elegantly bridged the divide between high concept and wearability. Every model was made over as a Swinton clone, then put into revisited versions of the white shirts, jeans, tailoring, bourgeois dresses and exploding multilayer shapes that have marked Viktor &amp; Rolf's greatest hits.</p><p>The calmed-down experimentalism panned out into an exceptional kind of refinement, perfectly in sync with the current mood. Face-framing lapels and collars (a look of the season) were set into everything from jean jackets to parkas and mannish shirts. Pewter and black satin shirtdresses with slashed sleeves, ribbed trapunto collars, shoulder patches and zip-up pockets walked a delicate line between ladylike and hip. A quiet gray chiffon column over a brown T-shirt, tethered with a slim leather belt, was one of the coolest notions of evening dress for fall.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""j76wch""></div></div><p>Scattered among these were incredible attention grabbers. Pushing layering and falling-off-the-shoulder to their conceptual limits, Viktor &amp; Rolf made outfits with five shirt collars peeling back, one atop the other. One girl appeared with eight men's jackets stacked on her shoulders. A giant, inflated silk-moiré bubble acted as a bolero–cum–down jacket on another. These were all insider references to the body of work the avant-garde pair has amassed up to now. The excitement was seeing how they channeled all that originality into the real world.</p></div>"
101,fall,2003,f2003,wink,"So what if Wink's show, held on a frigid night in a cramped East Village office/gallery, started late and didn't have any seats? The downtown girls who love these funky, unfussy clothes don't care about sitting down.</p><p>For his part, Wink designer Wynn Smith wisely limited the collection to 16 well-edited looks, shown on a frieze of models standing on a narrow platform. The proximity allowed for close inspection of his distinguishing characteristics: the delicately frayed black jersey trim on a grey flannel shift, for example, or a witty sweater-coat styled to resemble a trench. Smith also showed a sure hand in styling, lending his outfits an extra dimension by playing off fragile fabrics against denser materials—corduroy with chiffon, twill with voile, chunky knits with flimsy pieces.</p><p>Wink is one of the few young fashion designers not itching to be an avant-garde darling. He seems more interested in the subtle art of injecting originality into fashion's tried-and-true formulas. Judging from his hipster following, the effort is paying off.</p></div>"
102,fall,2003,f2003,y-3,"It's a label that was built from the ground up, literally. Yohji Yamamoto's Y-3 line started with those perpetually sold-out, incredibly cool sneakers. Now in its second season as a fully head-to-toe collection, Yamamoto's collaboration with Adidas (the Y is for Yohji, the 3 for the triple stripe that trims the athletic brand’s classic shoes and tracksuits) is proving something that Venus and Serena Williams have been trying to tell us for years: tweaked properly, sports clothes can be fashion.</p><p>This season's collection was full of track pants that were tailored like trousers (miniature pleats and all) and black leather-and-wool baseball jackets, cut just slightly too large to be considered standard issue. The white-on-black Adidas stripes were twisted around pant legs and morphed into gold military-officer-style Vs on the sleeves of great toggle coats and slim black hoodies. Cargo pants, which we thought we'd seen the end of after the Spring collections, looked entirely fresh—cut full from silky parachute fabric and cinched at the ankle to form a soft balloon shape.</p><p>And yes, there were brand-new trainers to lust after, this time in mirror-bright silver and glittery ruby-slipper red. Yamamoto said he was inspired by the young people who show up to work at his atelier every day in sporty street-chic clothes. No wonder, then, that the collection artfully summed up that hip-hop-meets-skater-boy-meets-old-school-prep aesthetic that fashion-obsessed under-30 types can't seem to get enough of right now.</p></div>"
103,fall,2003,f2003,yohji-yamamoto,"Sprinting ahead of the rest of the pack by showing his Fall/Winter 2003 ready-to-wear line during couture, Yohji Yamamoto took a few graphic, classic motifs and skewed them with his vision of what he calls ""couture that could be worn on the street."" Working mainly around black-and-white houndstooth fabrics, varying from bold checks to finer menswear wools, he used this collection to merge masculine tailoring and feminine shapeliness into layered silhouettes. The result: daywear with a soupçon of the Dior-esque '50s and a dash of punkish detail, cut with Yamamoto's original twists on pattern and structure.</p><p>Generous checked coats with voluminous sleeves hugged the waist and ended in shaggy fringe. Skirts pleated like kilts came layered over punky leggings in print chiffon and flat, pointed leather boots. Large checked scarves were wound around necklines and trailed off with a certain Parisian dash. Yohji's enduring tastes for Edwardiana and rocker styling showed up too, in sculpted peplum jackets, trenches and black leather motorcycle jackets. But it was the leanest, simplest pieces, like a slightly padded black jacket wound with a matching scarf, that proved his argument for clothes that can walk coolly off the runway and out onto the sidewalk.</p></div>"
104,fall,2003,f2003,zac-posen,"The Pool Room at the Four Seasons. Nerve center of the global power-broker network, icon of luxurious modern design, mecca for the rich and famous—and the site of Zac Posen’s third show. Yes, he’s come a long way from the dark, drafty former synagogue on the Lower East Side where he made his debut.</p><p>Well connected, socially visible and—most important—possessed of a distinct design sensibility, 22-year-old Posen has become one of the week’s hotter tickets. That, plus the major sponsors he scored this season (Swarovski, L’Oréal, Belvedere vodka and Shiseido, among others), perhaps explains how he got one of the city’s most prominent restaurants to shut down for the night, and every major model including Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen to report for duty. And although the show started nearly an hour late, Posen’s fall collection delivered a pretty, if sometimes repetitive, message to the A-list crowd (Claire Danes, China Chow).</p><p>Judging from the location and the backers, Posen’s interest in business is growing, and he’s developing new breadth in his collection as a result. He showed more daytime clothing, like slim tweed pantsuits, cotton piqué shirts, delicate blouses made from shredded, mitered strips of voile, and some great coats (a coppery trench with an oversize capelet top; a cheerful hooded jacket whose fur trim ran over the head and down the spine, ending in a tail). But while Posen was more sparing in his use of signature touches like bias draping, handkerchief hems and meticulously pieced skirts, his glee for glamorous eveningwear is unquenchable. He used a map-printed silk crepe for fluttery halter dresses, draped Christensen in a beautiful purple satin gown and sent Alek Wek out in a Vegas-worthy “dress” made from strands of sparkling rhinestones worn over a black thong. The Pool Room has never looked so good.</p></div>"
105,fall,2003,f2003,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo came out of her shell for fall, showing her most focused, confident collection to date. Her mantra? Sleek, neat, chic. Inspired by <em>Blade Runner</em>, the pieces showcased the designer's tailoring skills. Cornejo offered a fresh variation on the traditional jacket and skirt combination by streamlining vests and skirts. Many of her dresses and jackets had interesting geometric or cape-like sleeve details that lightly referenced both sci-fi and the '80s without veering into kitsch. Likewise, hooded and cocoon jackets worn over slim-as-legging pants evoked the artfulness of Geoffrey Beene and early Comme des Gar¿ons rather than <em>Barbarella</em>. Cornejo enlivened her serious palette of black and grey with ivory and neon green, and strict tailoring was offset by a riff of draped dresses. While zippers and hoodies added a note of sportiness, Cornejo's sophisticated coats summed up the discipline and sophistication of the collection as a whole.</p></div>"
1,spring,2004,s2004,a-f-vandevorst,"“We used paper to research new shapes,” said An Vandevorst backstage after the Spring 2004 presentation. “But we liked the effect so much we decided to use it in the show,” added her husband and design partner Filip Arickx. And use it they did, opening with a simple brown paper mac followed by a series of increasingly complex concoctions in the same “fabric”: a jacket whose sleeves were hoisted up with leather straps, a skirt with layers of jigsaw-puzzle pleats. The experiment was then echoed in more-accessible white cotton.</p><p>Super-luxurious materials may not be A.F. Vandevorst’s thing, but clever construction certainly is—and that needn’t mean stiff and complicated. Witness a pristine white cotton shirtdress, or a pair of super-skinny, zippered pants in the palest suede, or a simple chocolate canvas trench. A chiffon dress printed with plumes was, quite literally, as light as a feather; a pea-green jersey dress was sliced down the back to reveal a flash of bare spine. Even their print, in the form of an arty, abstract paisley looked—heaven forbid!—almost chic.</p></div>"
2,spring,2004,s2004,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti's slight, pretty collection confirmed her ongoing love affair with chiffon. Although the show opened with a full-skirted frock in cocoa satin smudged with a shadowy green rose print—perfect for a royal garden party in the fifties—Ferretti modernized the quaint vintage look with flat sandals and a tattered wisp of chiffon engirdling the waist.</p><p>It was a taste of things to come, as the designer brought on an endless parade of airy nothings in her fetish fabric, made lighter still with the raw, unfinished edges she celebrates. Angelic little dresses were composed of layer upon layer of mousseline, like a mille-feuille pastry; or sweetened with piecrust frills; or embellished with vertical panels that wafted in the breeze from the sun-dappled park beyond the tent’s draped curtains. The audience seemed to be experiencing some collective déjà vu, perhaps because many of these dresses so closely evoked the fey frocks with which the designer closed her diffusion Philosophy line earlier this week in Milan.</p><p>Although Ferretti’s prints—giant tone-on-tone blooms with a hand-painted feel, or marbled effects like the endpapers used by Florentine bookbinders—were some of the subtlest of the spring shows, her palette conformed to the pungent color mix so popular this season. Layerings of cardigans or suede mod coats over diaphanous blouses and skirts produced arresting combinations like carrot and magenta, copper and amethyst, and peridot and cherry; and Ferretti saved the best till last with a dramatic finale of enchanting goddess gowns in ravishing Pre-Raphaelite hues.</p></div>"
3,spring,2004,s2004,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua has always fixated on the fragile interplay of chiffon pieces and lingerie, rustling up the kind of outfits a cooler sort of girl would assemble for going out. With that idea front and center this season, Dell'Acqua is in his element—and it's come at just the right moment, as he's hit a new high in his business.</p><p>His treatment of summer's favorite (but inherently tricky) shades of beige, nude, and vintage-boudoir pink came as pretty little sheer ruched camisole tops and tattered, asymmetrically-ruffled dresses. Dell'Acqua has developed a neat strategy for making sheerness wearable: His fine-knit underpinnings create an opaque base over which to layer and tie all those chiffons, a blush-saving trick that turns a certain light eroticism into a realistic proposition.</p><p>Dell'Acqua said he was inspired by actress Monica Vitti, and the cream lace shifts sprinkled with crystals at neck and hem that he showed for evening were a modernized, attractively offhand version of her sixties glamour. The outfits using black tulle layered over jewels looked too close to the original idea by Alber Elbaz to pass critical muster, however. For the most part, this was a confident collection that shows Dell'Acqua growing up. As the creative mind behind La Perla's ready-to-wear, and with a new backer for his own line, chances are there will be a lot more Dell'Acqua in the shops soon—and that's something to look forward to.</p></div>"
4,spring,2004,s2004,alexander-mcqueen,"It takes a showman like Alexander McQueen to get the lifeblood pumping back into fashion performance. His show—staged in the Salle Wagram, a nineteenth-century Parisian dance hall—was an exuberantly hilarious reenactment of Sydney Pollack’s Depression-era film <em>They Shoot Horses, Don't They?</em> Choreographed by Michael Clark over two weeks of intensive rehearsals in London, the narrative involved dancers, models, and audience in a visceral celebration of exquisitely glamorous clothes.</p><p>In the opening scene, the girls entered—dancing for all they were worth on the arms of muscle-bound sailors and hunky hopefuls—dressed in fishtailed silver lamé, figure-hugging cha-cha dresses, and show-stopping gowns with spangled bodices and huge feathered skirts. Other competitors whirled on wearing pink corseted tulle tutus over gray ballet sweats; mint satin tap-suits; or a slinky confection of gray checkerboard chiffon. A Billie Holiday look-alike, dramatically vamping in pink charmeuse and ostrich, vied for attention as flashy bodysuited showgirls were energetically twirled aloft by their partners.</p><p>McQueen’s signatures—elaborately pieced tailoring (now beautifully softened with delicate inserts of lingerie) and body-hugging denims spliced onto nude tulle—also did star turns. The pace picked up even further in the elimination race, in which morphed-together fluorescent chiffons and sports pieces ran hell-for-leather (on impossibly high heels) in a hotly contested dash around the room.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""kvz6ee""></div></div><p>There was even an opening for daywear. Blue-collar marathon survivors staggered out wearing plaid shirts, coats, and skirts made from quilts and recycled patchworks of shirting material, all crafted to the McQueen sex-bomb template. The show reached its climax as a lone exhausted dancer in a silver sequined gown mock-expired center stage. As she was carried off by the designer and his choreographer, thunderous applause rocked the hall.</p></div>"
5,spring,2004,s2004,andrew-gn,"""For me, spring/summer is always about happy, merry clothes,"" said Andrew Gn, practically an understatement given the powerful, punchy prints—polka dots and blossoms galore—that bloomed large throughout his collection.</p><p>Out trooped his ladies, à la Catherine Deneuve in <em>Belle de Jour</em>—all shades and chignons, patent heels and lashings of scarlet lipstick—to the sound of Annie Lennox belting out: ""I was born an original sinner."" Things started out prim with polite cotton coat-dresses, their seams traced with ribbon, then got naughtier thanks to pleated minidresses in red, lilac, sunflower yellow, and coral. But Gn really hit his stride with outfits that combined his exceptional sense of print, color, and decoration. A red polka-dot shirt, say, was worn with a circle skirt (fast becoming <em>the</em> piece of the season) boasting great bunches of hydrangeas; there were silk jackets bursting with roses, ruffled shirts dappled with daisies, and jackets that buttoned with fluttering poppies.</p><p>Spectacular crystal and glass creations by famed costume jeweler Robert Goossens contributed to the already vibrant mix: glossy belts, dramatic bracelets, and necklaces holding up pretty halterneck dresses. Wear Gn to a summer garden party? Absolutely—if you want to see heads swivel in your direction.</p></div>"
6,spring,2004,s2004,ann-demeulemeester,"When the rest of fashion is running in the direction of color, glamour, and lighthearted frilliness, where does a woman who believes in black, androgynous layering, lived-in leather, and symbolic slogans go? She could just keep on walking with sister Ann. Ms. Demeulemeester is not about to renounce a lifetime’s work just because of the season’s dominant trends. On the other hand, Demeulemeester is a sensitive designer who recognizes a change in the air.</p><p>For summer, she added white to her favorite spectrum of darks, and searched for a way to express the tendency toward shortness and flounce in skirts. One solution had her adding puffy cargo pockets to her favorite hip wraps and coats, letting them trail floppily beneath the hemline. She also made her signature leathers as airy as possible, slashing them with concertina cuts until they were as fine as paper mesh, and layering them among the washed satins and chiffons.</p><p>As a nod to optimism, she sent out an enlarged rose print (done in black and white) and T-shirts with “’Til Roses” written in mirror-image graffiti. She even forced herself to send out a single outfit in a muted, sanded orange, though she admitted backstage that it had been a struggle. “I searched for a long, long time for this color,” she laughed. “I was afraid it would be too much.”</p></div>"
7,spring,2004,s2004,anna-molinari,"For her Spring 2004 show, Anna Molinari designer Rosella Tarabini imagined a romantic girl putting together a look for Glastonbury, the English summer music festival which these days is less about mud and sleeping bags than it is about VIP tents and paparazzi. Tarabini dipped into granny’s attic for a haul of lacy, vintage-style dresses and lingerie layers, cut off at the thigh and worn with flat fringed moccasin boots. Done in fragile cream and dusty pink, these pieces were embellished with precious flower embroideries, crystal beading, or the odd little layer of feather cropping up among the flounces in the skirts. Cover-ups came in the form of tweedy, beige, Chanel-like coats and jackets that appeared to have been run through the wash several times in order to look suitably secondhand.</p><p>Tarabani added a touch of grit to the mix with what she described as “tribal” accessories (shell-festooned leather belts and crafty necklaces) and a section of black, Patti Smith–inspired washed leather jeans, suede tabards, and oversized chiffon tops. But for the most part this is, as always, a collection of dresses for pretty young things, with a seasonal twist to keep it all current. The sheer repetition made for something of a trance-inducing performance, but it’s a sweet enough groove for a summer night’s fantasy.</p></div>"
8,spring,2004,s2004,anna-sui,"Anna Sui is clearly in the throes of a heavy-duty blue crush. Her spring collection was centered on the modern teenage surfer girl—a descendant of the Gidgets of yore, just as feminine but far more independent, with a stubborn hippie streak.</p><p>The Sui girl has her priorities in order. Her wardrobe starts with a bikini, a surf shirt, or a pair of lace-edged board shorts; after that, anything is fair game. If she’s heading to a club or a party, she might drop a delicate baby-doll mini on top, tie on a printed apron dress, or wrap up in a short daisy-print canvas trench. If she’s got a serious social engagement, she might switch to a pretty gold shift dress, or zip on some black beaded jams. She’s got a yen for the psychedelic era, judging by the swirling flower and paisley prints and the mind-bending color combinations: pink with orange, lavender with blue, turquoise with green. Everything’s always worn with piles of shell jewelry, and fragile sandals or clear plastic Mary Janes.</p><p>Of course, the runway is the designer’s playground, but Sui’s collection isn’t all fantasy. With her trim trenches, sheer hoodies, and pretty little floral dresses, even women who don’t spend their days making waves will find plenty to get stoked.</p></div>"
9,spring,2004,s2004,anne-klein,"Seismic shifts seem to be a trend this season, and it’s not a hemline movement. Anne Klein, in the process of changing ownership, named a new designer after Charles Nolan announced he was leaving to campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Governor Howard Dean. His replacement, Michael Smaldone, debuted with a spring collection that added a bit of edge to his predecessor’s aesthetic, without veering off wildly in a new direction.</p><p>Smaldone’s theme was “urban nymph,” and he set the mood by paving his runway with wood chips (not the best surface for high heels, as the models soon discovered). Working with a limited palette—white, yellow, black, and khaki, with a few plum-toned accents—he kept silhouettes simple, with pencil skirts, tailored jackets cropped above the wrist, and full-cut white shirts tucked into slim pants or shorts.</p><p>The designer attached a high leather waistband to a few pants and skirts, used hook and eyes up the back of a skirt, and lavished silver beading in unexpected places—on a khaki tunic over cropped pants, and on an A-line skirt paired with a yellow striped shirt. While he may have chosen classic lines, clearly he likes a vivid detail.</p></div>"
10,spring,2004,s2004,as-four,"As Four are almost as well known for their lifestyle (they share a communal bed in a silver-painted loft) as for their innovative silhouettes. Hard-to-miss and easy-to-love regulars on the New York City party circuit, Adi, Ange, Gabi, and Kai showcased their singular vision in the Bryant Park tents for the first time this season.</p><p>The design collective conjured a fairy-tale world, with a Ben Brunnemer soundtrack that ranged from Nico to break beats and a palette that mixed gold, pastels, and jewel tones and was embellished with amoeba-shaped paillettes and appliqués. Despite the copious amounts of Swarovski sparkle, however, shape was the most dazzling element of the show, with garments slinking, slithering, and blooming around the body in feats of engineering that recalled Paul Poiret’s famous lampshade dresses. Pants were rendered in infinite variety—enlivened with zips, twists, insets, and asymmetries—while tunics, jackets, and accessories took on an array of extravagant, organic forms. The over-the-top quotient was certainly high, but there were also plenty of wearable pieces among the <em>Arabian Nights</em>–style fantasy. The exotic appeal of a headdress hung with tear-shaped panels that functioned as a top, for example, was tempered by the almost classical restraint of a pleated, toga-style dress. The closing look, a fetishlike gold bodysuit that extended to the face and feet of a model who was leading (or being led by) As Four’s pit bull, Powder (in matching gold capelet), proved a fittingly gilded end to a show that evidenced the group’s Midas touch.</p></div>"
11,spring,2004,s2004,badgley-mischka,"Badgley Mischka is sure to see some of its designs show up at the Emmys this weekend, but its star-studded show was a performance in itself, with dueling photographers nearly coming to blows over access to Bebe Neuwirth and Cynthia Nixon in the front row. The Trumps (Blaine, and Donald with Melania) were also in attendance, along with Kelly Klein and Toni Braxton; but the jewels in the crown (and how they sparkled!) were Beyoncé (in a floral-print bustier with rhinestone beading, and chandelier earrings) and Jay-Z (tee, jeans, and Nikes, plus a serious gold watch).</p><p>Mark Badgley and James Mischka's inspiration was Maggie, the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>, and music producer Javier Peral spliced sound bites from the movie into a mix that also featured Marilyn Manson and Goldfrapp. The clothes, however, seemed more suited for a Russian princess with a fondness for Fabergé, dripping as they were with pearls, beads, sequins, and all matter of glitter—a kind of tribute to craftsmanship over subtlety. Some of the prettiest looks were the most restrained, like a washed chiffon gown in a color described by the program notes as “thistle” and the georgette dresses in Easter-egg hues that closed the show. The stand-out piece was a white frayed chiffon dress that gave the effect of ribbon-like strips woven together by tiny, magic hands.</p><p>When Donna Summer's <em>Working the Midnight Shift</em> came on the soundtrack (“I'm just a working girl, just earning a living…working that midnight shift for that extra little something”) it offered a tongue-in-cheek take on a collection aimed at celebrities whose job it is to look good on the red carpet. Nice work if you can get it.</p></div>"
12,spring,2004,s2004,balenciaga,"Amazing anatomy: that’s what one needs to acquire before even thinking about Balenciaga for spring. Nicholas Ghesquière’s hourglass suits are all rump-hugging to-the-knee skirt, cinched torso, and assertive shoulder, with raised seams running over every contour. High-collared, multi-buttoned cadet jackets, in glove-smooth putty leather or pristine cream canvas, come nipped at the waist, or with the shoulders shaped on the curve and doubly emphasized by tiny boleros. “I wanted to contrast structure and fluidity,” he said. “Things that give power to femininity.”</p><p>This sculptured, futuristic/militaristic silhouette marches to a beat not heard since Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana stalked the eighties Paris runways. But there was more: Ghesquière followed his couture—like, neutral tailoring with short, flounced cutaway dresses in vivid colors and flower prints, delicately suspended over neoprene bras. A highly feminine conflation of his previous experiments with patchwork, some of these pieces were collages of powder-pink corsetry and fluted fuchsia chiffon, floating over, say, a lime-green bra. Others, in old-fashioned flower prints, ended in curly ruffles, weighted with zippers in the hems.</p><p>Whittled down to twenty-six outfits, this was a small but perfectly formed design statement. None of Balenciaga’s beloved pants and T-shirts made the edit, but hopes are high they’re somewhere in the back.</p></div>"
13,spring,2004,s2004,bcbg-max-azria,"It would be all too easy for the soft-spoken femininity that’s dominating New York’s spring collections to go wrong. A little too much lace, a few too many bows, and poof!—sugar has turned to saccharine. In one of the season’s more refreshing collections, Max Azria demonstrated a sure hand with the trend, showing a distinctive, individual take on what’s becoming well-trodden terrain.</p><p>Instead of the same Easter-basket pastels, Azria chose an unusual palette featuring a twenties color scheme of deep rosy pink, aquamarine, pale chartreuse, black, and ivory. He added big floral prints reminiscent of Dagobert Peche’s Wiener Werkstätte designs, and balanced retro-looking fabrics like lightweight cotton voile and washed twill with modern nylon and Lycra blends. The silhouettes were clean and easy: A-line dresses that skimmed the body, cropped pants, short jackets with three-quarter sleeves, and thigh-length coats.</p><p>Azria delivered charm aplenty—particularly via the tiny ruffles that he stacked on the pretty bikini tops and bottoms, scattered on a minidress, and used to line the edges of a camisole neckline or hem a pair of Clamdiggers. Like a good cook with a tricky recipe, the designer knew just when to stop fussing with his fashion.</p></div>"
14,spring,2004,s2004,behnaz-sarafpour,"For Spring 2004, Behnaz Sarafpour jettisoned the sotto voce sweetness of her ladylike Fall line and replaced it with an aggressively sexy stance—a change in direction so dramatic, it might provoke a few cases of fashion whiplash.</p><p>The opening look set the tone: Karolina Kurkova striding out in high heels, a tight topknot, and a short, snug, strapless black dress made from rib knit and patent leather. Sarafpour followed with more of the same, featuring pencil skirts with patent panels; skintight pants; and black blouson jackets cut to hit just below the ribs, all layered over knit tops. She wrapped satin bustiers over dresses and rib-knit tanks, and made short trench coats from slick white or black patent.</p><p>This designer has a witty sense of proportion, which showed up in pieces like the black satin camisole with a loose, loopy bow; the tiny boleros encrusted with big sequins; and the cheerfully chic, oversize gingham taffeta blouses. But when a lovely, body-skimming pink satin dress appeared on the runway, it seemed to have wandered in from a different collection entirely.</p></div>"
15,spring,2004,s2004,betsey-johnson,"A year ago, Betsey Johnson was in a reflective mood; she’d just turned 60 and, with a new vacation home in Mexico to tempt her, was hinting that she might be ready to step back from the day-to-day fashion grind. Yeah, right. In the intervening twelve months, Johnson has launched a secondary label called Betseyville; signed a deal to license her name for pajamas, loungewear, and lingerie; and continued full tilt with her schedule of raucous, fashion-show-as-entertainment presentations.</p><p>This season, the designer configured her show space as a cabaret, setting up tables and chairs and serving drinks to create the right giddy mood. The clothes showed her usual mix of influences: a little bubblegum, a little bondage, a little punk, and a lot of ruffles. There were baby-doll dresses, skinny jeans and cropped tops, tiny T-shirts, minis and slip dresses. But even by Johnson’s cheeky standards, items like a little nightie that said “Fluffer,” and T-shirts printed with the slogan “Guys love B.J.” ratcheted up the raunch factor just a little too high.</p></div>"
16,spring,2004,s2004,bill-blass,"There’s been more than the usual amount of drama at the House of Blass this year. In February, one day after they’d shown the Spring line, house creative director Lars Nilsson and his design partner Herve Pierre Braillard were fired. Two weeks later, Blass management appointed Michael Vollbracht, an illustrator and sometime designer—and perhaps more importantly, a close friend of the late designer’s—as the new name behind the label.</p><p>Vollbracht’s mission is to retain Blass’s fabled, and faithful, customers, while also bringing in the next generation of ladies-in-waiting, and he made his ties to the old days clear by putting some of Blass’s favorite former models, like Pat Cleveland and Diane Dewitt, on the runway. This fall, he’s hitting the road as the house ambassador, with trunk shows lined up in Chicago, Palm Beach, and Houston.</p><p>The spring collection he showed is sure to appeal to the loyalist camps around the country. Blass classics, like cashmere sweaters paired with taffeta skirts, lightweight wool suits in navy or eye-catching pink, and taffeta clutch coats over slim skirts, can’t fail to please, while airy chiffon evening dresses offer just the right amount of flutter for formal events. Some of Vollbracht’s reiterations looked more clunky than classic on the runway, and their appeal to the younger crowd remains to be seen. But as Blass himself said, “timing is everything,” and Vollbracht may just turn out to be right on target.</p></div>"
17,spring,2004,s2004,blaak,"Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif of Blaak make casual streetwear out of floppy, worn-in fabric. But what sets the line apart from a humdrum jeans collection is its deceptive simplicity—a lot of thought goes into creating that impression of easy, low-maintenance hipness.</p><p>For spring, Blaak took pre-washed, overdyed cottons and made them into crinkly shirtdresses and circle skirts with crazy animal prints and zigzagging, African-inspired patterns. Okada and Sharif even tackled that most formal of classics, the Chanel-inspired suit, fraying the edges and running zippers up the back of the skirt. (Close up, what looked like lightweight tweed turned out to be hand-perforated cotton, run through the washing machine several dozen times to give it a great, worn-out, messed-up feel.) Another standout was a red-and-white printed anorak, with elastic creating bunchy effects through the torso and sleeves; it turned out to be made of paper. Okada described this season’s look as “Random—borderline mad!” But the collection made perfect sense for seekers of cool, one-off pieces to amp up a summer wardrobe.</p></div>"
18,spring,2004,s2004,boudicca,"Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby knew they had to put on their very best performance to live up to their new standing as the latest great white hopes of London fashion. After winning the support of American Express, the pair, known as Boudicca, is literally following in the footsteps of Alexander McQueen, the last son of the avant-garde to tread the hard road from East End starvation to fashion stardom.</p><p>If the audience expected major McQueen-style theatrics along with the new funding, they were disappointed. Broach and Kirkby don’t want any storyline to distract from their extraordinarily precise, almost molded tailoring, with its geometrically exact inserts, flying pocket flaps, fanny-hugging curves, stiff pleats, and voluptuous, rolling flounces. And while there’s something in the rigor of these clothes that marks them as belonging to the same school of craftsmanship as McQueen, the details—like pleated grosgrain edges and cross-lacing—are pure Boudicca.</p><p>The label’s best feats for Spring were performed in lustrous white heavy-grade couture cotton: sculptural, high-waisted dresses underlined with insets of black; or an intensely curvaceous white skirt suit with the seaming picked out in flat grosgrain ruffles. Sporty, space suit-inspired jackets, some in crunchy metallic silk shot with Lurex, came with zippers diagonally splicing the front. But the highlights were Boudicca’s skirts. Contrived to offer amazing views from the back, they came tightly fitted over the rump in mathematically exact piecings stamped with studs, or with fan-like tail feathers made of stiff pleats, like some strange modern take on a bustle. Close up, all that classy workmanship is a marvel to behold; but viewed with a less technical eye, it also spells S-E-X. That’s a strong step in the right direction along the rocky road to recognition outside London.</p></div>"
19,spring,2004,s2004,burberry-prorsum,"How right it was that Christopher Bailey called in Kate Moss and Stella Tennant—two exemplars of instinctive British style—to show his most accomplished Burberry collection to date. “I just wanted it to look as if it was thrown together,” the designer said. “As if you’d been caught in the rain.”</p><p>Given that the house icon is a mackintosh, it was a stroke of genius for Bailey to build the collection around summer showers; the washed-out pastels and off-whites he worked into crinkled shirtings, gauzes, and leathers looked like they’d benefited from a good soaking of soft English rain. He opened with pinstriped shirting made into trenches, a bag and great skirts that dipped nonchalantly from a hip yoke, interspersed with the prettiest cotton tops and wrap dresses. Breezy shirtdresses and blouses were feminized with scalloped edges and embroidery, but never to the point of cutesiness. Bailey took elements of London’s tomboyish street style—a little skirt, a knit top, and the stringy college scarf he’s made famous—and made an outfit that would pass muster in any chic global capital.</p><p>As for the classic trench, it was cut neat and to the knee in delicious wrinkled putty-colored leather; transformed into a bolero with storm flaps; and reduced to a tiny silky capelet for evening. Splashed-raindrop prints played over coats, jackets, and swimwear as well as on the black-and-white wrap dress that Moss chose as her favorite piece. The classic plaid appeared too, on white-edged clutches and—what else?—a tightly-rolled umbrella. It’s that kind of confidence to play with the signature looks that has this house thriving in an otherwise stormy economy.</p></div>"
20,spring,2004,s2004,calvin-klein-collection,"It was the same runway in the same giant photography studio with the same top models strutting in front of the same audience—all as in seasons past. But for the Spring show at Calvin Klein, there was one very large difference: That wasn’t Calvin taking the bow. Last winter, the designer sold his company to Phillips-Van Heusen, stepped back from day-to-day design duties, and named Francisco Costa, an ex-Gucci designer, head of the women’s collection. Cue lights…</p><p>Given the intimidation factor—Klein observed the show from the sidelines—it’s not surprising that Costa played his debut on the safe side. The collection was very Klein in spirit, hewing to a palette of black, white, and warm brown tones with occasional shots of creamy orange and pink. There were elegantly limp knits in featherweight cashmere, viscose, and silk layered under leather jackets; crisp shirts billowing out over tiny shorts or slim tailored pants; and the kind of interesting details that Klein would have used to raise the occasional eyebrow (a lacy, laser-cut lambskin coat, a bright pink taffeta tunic dress, and clear Lucite pumps with neon-bright straps).</p><p>How much influence Klein still wields in the design room is unclear, but Costa seems determined not to veer too far from the founder’s course. Then again, why mess with fantastic success? When the show closed with Natalia in a fluttery organza-and-tulle dress that was clearly related to fall’s ruffled robes, it was far more homage than farewell.</p></div>"
21,spring,2004,s2004,capucci,"Has quirkiness and nonconformity disappeared entirely from the fashion system? Not when you’re looking at Italy’s multinational Capucci project, for which Bernhard Willhelm (German-born, Antwerp-trained, Paris-dwelling) oversees ready-to-wear, Sybilla (Spanish) designs the once-a-year evening collection, and Franca Maria Carraro (Italian) does the shoes. For spring, Willhelm had fun with the Roman founder’s extraordinary way with volumes. “I was playing with the idea of boxes last season,” he said. “This is sort of a continuation of that, but now I’ve added circles.” Lines of thick, wavy cord stitched onto the hems of short dresses were another, less conceptual borrowing from the archive.</p><p>The cutely eccentric flat shoes and a bright emerald plissé dress, whose ballooning sleeves were suspended from shoulder straps, made for the presentation’s best moments. Willhelm’s personal skew toward the eighties still comes through in an insistence on stripes and leaf-green shades. For curiosity value alone, the Capucci project is a line worth knowing about, but in actual fashion practice, these are strictly clothes for girls who will make their artsy way through the season, avoiding anything so obvious as a trend.</p></div>"
22,spring,2004,s2004,carolina-herrera,"It may have been gray and muggy outside, but inside the Bryant Park tents at Carolina Herrera’s spring show it was all blue skies and lavender-scented Mediterranean breezes. Inspired by the languid, light-soaked Riviera photos taken by Jacques-Henri Lartigue at the turn of the last century, Herrera sent out a dreamy, pretty collection with full-spectrum appeal.</p><p>There’s a new team in the Herrera office, since earlier this year the designer named her daughter Patricia Lansing as designer and Herve Pierre Braillard (ex-Bill Blass and Vera Wang) as design director. Herrera’s trademark elegance is still the guiding force, but there are other influences as well, offering a lighter, sexier feeling with occasional sporty accents. One key piece was the racer-back tank; it opened the show in sheer ivory cashmere, went through a series of embellishments, and ended up black, beaded, and paired with a floaty ivory georgette skirt.</p><p>The palette was limited but not dull: Ivory and black were set off by pale pink, a rosy brick, and shots of lemon yellow, plus a few meandering abstract prints. Fluttery chiffon and slinky jersey dresses were often topped by crocodile link belts or trimmed with wide striped ribbon, while smart, slim day suits got a dash of contrast topstitching. Even without Biarritz on your itinerary, this collection will guarantee you a place in the sun.</p></div>"
23,spring,2004,s2004,celine,"Michael Kors must spend an awful lot of time seeking out inspiration at the beach because, when it comes to designing summer clothes, that's where he always seems to be. For his eponymous line it was Capri; for Celine, it's Tahiti. And very Gauguin it was too, with great hibiscus blooms, pampas grass, and yucca leaves covering everything from skintight jeans to silk shirts, swimsuits, and trailing head scarves.</p><p>Tanned bodies were dripping in gold from the earlobes down: gold purses, gold shoes, you name it. That was the Monte Carlo effect—another muse of a beach for Kors. It's easy to imagine those healthy-wealthy ladies of Monaco decking themselves out in gold-chain prints with lots of matching accessories; perfect for a night in front of the roulette wheel at the casino.</p><p>No one can deny this designer's gift for polish, nor his flair for optimism. As the last fleet of models strutted their stuff in dresses of hot pink, turquoise, black, and white columns suspended from chain-embroidered bodices, one couldn't help but smile. It was a fun trip, but since this is Kors's final collection as the house designer, it's anybody's guess what Celine's next stop will be.</p></div>"
24,spring,2004,s2004,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan showed off his pretty side for spring. Stripped of stagy effects, his presentation threw no baffling obstacles in the way of his audience, allowing it instead to appreciate the extraordinary complexity and refinement of the clothes. Building from a beginning of casual canvas workwear, Chalayan progressed into florals and then on to an ending of ruched, ruffled dresses with a touch of the fifties, in what seemed to be Hawaiian prints.</p><p>If that reads like a severe case of personality change, don’t be misled. When Chalayan applies his mind to a pair of cotton drill overalls, they end up abstracted and femininized, maybe with a drape of muslin in the bib. His gauzy, faded florals appeared intercut with sporty gray jersey pieces. And when it came to the girly summer-holiday dresses, with their ruffled peplums or stiff frills curling around the neckline, it paid to zoom in on exactly what was going on in that cheery “Hawaiian” print. Mixed up in the pattern is an ancient battle, fought around a modern-day hotel swimming pool, with a plane in the background; Chalayan described it as an exploration of his own ethnic background as a Turkish Cypriot, with the fifties feel alluding to the decade when Cyprus’s political troubles were at their height.</p><p>Still, like everything else in the collection, those dresses carry their symbolism with a youthful lightness. And the fact that Chalayan’s radar has also led him, this season, to explore themes that are preoccupying other designers, only goes to show his ingenuity at its best.</p></div>"
25,spring,2004,s2004,chanel,"“It’s about Chanel, but wearing it played down,” announced Karl Lagerfeld, just before the Spring show. “Sweet, but not too ladylike.” Thus introduced, a parade of neat but never uptight soft little pastel-pink checked tweeds, dainty microprinted georgette dresses, guipure lace skirts, and fresh takes on Coco’s favorite tricot dressing trotted out happily. The inimitable signature jacket came light as a cardigan and delightfully trimmed with tiny raw-edged chiffon ruffles in place of the classic braided edging. To further underscore the superior abilities of Chanel’s workshops, Lagerfeld took the pattern of antique knitted bed covers (a labor-intensive, French-provincial technique called “ouvrage des dames”) and had it reproduced in narrow, scallop-edged cardigan coats which he slipped over short dresses. Even the teensy bikinis were done up in crochet.</p><p>A cute idea popped up amid all this sweetness: the khaki trench, Chanelized by ridges of tweed inset at the seams. That’s no ordinary edging, as Lagerfeld took pains to point out; the tweed was specially woven by the great Parisian couture-craft supplier Lesage. In a world where the word “luxury” has been overused and devalued, Chanel is one house where the standard flies as high as ever. And it is Lagerfeld’s nonchalance with these to-die-for details that imbues the clothes with their essence of confident chic.</p></div>"
26,spring,2004,s2004,chloe,"There was one model in the Chloé show who was a dead ringer for the house’s designer, Phoebe Philo. That may have been an unconscious fluke of casting, but the clothes look like Phoebe, too. Now that she’s moved to Paris, the London girl’s references have acquired a French accent. “I went through my mum’s old fashion magazines—she had a garageful, from when my parents were living in Paris in the late seventies. That’s when I was born,"" she said, ""and I just thought the girls looked so gorgeous, fresh, and happy.”</p><p>So picture a time when French mags showed endless sunny, energetic spreads of models skipping about, laughing in accessible ready-to-wear. When wide-legged bottom-hugging trousers and jeans were cut up to the waist, wedges were in, and cheap-chic fluorescent jelly sandals were paired with short shorts, sporty striped rugby shirts, washed cotton overalls, and sloppy rolled-up work pants.</p><p>Philo recaptured a lot of that feeling quite literally, in what looked like a natural reconfiguring of her knack for sexy designer denim. She also worked in the dressy, Frenchified eyelet and lace that has underpinned the label since the sixties, along with Fiorucci-era jokey banana prints for off-the-shoulder tees and swimsuits. The shoes—which under Philo’s tenure have become a house moneymaker—were a cool composite of Lucite wedge, slivers of silver leather, and macramé toe strap.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vbmq39""></div></div><p>At the end, Phoebe herself made a runway turn for photographers in Chloé jeans and a gauzy blue top—a far cry from her usual brief, cool, self-deprecating, British wave. Perhaps that’s a sign of her growth in confidence, but it also gave Chloé’s worldwide fans their first opportunity to get a good look at the personality who drives the brand. Cute move.</p></div>"
27,spring,2004,s2004,christian-dior,"John Galliano didn’t go on one of his extensive research trips to come up with the Christian Dior concept for spring; perhaps he just popped across Paris to an exhibition of Marlene Dietrich’s clothes that ran this summer. “It was Marlene,” explained the designer. “But then I thought, who would she be today? Marianne Faithfull, Janis Joplin, Courtney Love, Patti Smith!”</p><p>Marlene was clearly behind his opening series of curvy gunmetal satin suits with a forties air; the fox-fur jackets that swanked through the show; and the beautiful bias-cut dresses, in silver or gold lamé tissue, that starred towards the end. In between, Galliano mixed up her influence with tattoo-print body stockings, suits with pieces of corsets and garters dangling from the skirt and jacket hems, and some hip-hop–influenced silk sportswear. There were enough items in the melee to satisfy the faithful: his signature print chiffon dresses, some ultra-sexy swimsuits, and the new twist on the Dior bag (it comes with a fox stole attached to the strap). But anyone looking for Galliano’s next great leap forward will have to wait till next season.</p></div>"
28,spring,2004,s2004,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro channeled the season’s twin themes—frilly vintage dresses and sailor-girl styling—through a séance with Wallis Simpson in her Cap Ferrat incarnation. Mrs. Simpson-gone-kicky wasn’t a bad solution for reminding the audience of what the duo does best: striped cashmeres (the foundation of their business) and the reinterpretations of ladylike dressing, or what they call “clunky couture.”</p><p>The nautical stripes came in red-and-white sweaters and in chevrons of blue and white on neat, knee-length cashmere dresses. These were worn with summery faux-tweedy shorts, jackets, and trenches made out of painted linen, the models tottering on playful printed platforms. References to Simpson’s taste for Elsa Schiaparelli’s surrealist creations and her obsession with Cartier jewels were found in the circus-theme embroideries on burlap jackets, the patterns of hands and birds on silk or chiffon dresses, and the naïve sequin brooches in the shape of dragonflies.</p><p>To their credit, the husband-and-wife team knows how to negotiate fashion history in a way that never looks overearnest. Their offhand way of dealing with prettiness and print—along with some excellent striped beach bags—made their collection a happy, nonchallenging addition to the outlook for summer.</p></div>"
29,spring,2004,s2004,comme-des-garcons,"Technically speaking, there was only one garment in Rei Kawakubo’s collection: a skirt. Apart from the stocking tops used to veil the breasts from complete nudity, and the horned cloth headdresses, she showed nothing else. Not even any shoes. And in fact, with their bunchy forms, exposed ridges of raw seams, and absence of waistbands, they weren’t even really skirts as we know them. Kawakubo said the show was about “designing from shapeless, abstract, intangible forms, not taking into account the body.”</p><p>It was also about testing the concentration of the audience. The wandering imagination tried to seize on the source of Kawakubo’s forms. Were those upholstery covers or curtains she had torn down to sling onto the hips? What was the provenance of those puffy petals of fabric with their occasional pleated underlayers? As an enforced twenty-minute meditation on a single piece of clothing, it was a puzzling experience way beyond the realms of any normal fashion show. Still, there is something in Kawakubo’s out-there abstraction that weirdly parallels the obsession with circular skirts that several designers are currently exploring. Apparently, it’s not really all she's designed for summer, either. At the end of the show, Adrian Joffe, Kawakubo’s husband, was standing by with assurances that there are plenty of jackets in the showroom.</p></div>"
30,spring,2004,s2004,costume-national,"Suede pants laminated to the body. Leather jackets that fit like a glove. Hemlines that leave little, if anything, to the imagination. If this is what turns you on, then Costume National designer Ennio Capasa is your man.</p><p>The collection wasn't all about steam, though. It takes a confident hand to stitch a web of seams into a pair of skintight blush-pink suede pants without making them look either clumsy or banal. And there was plenty of skill evident in skinny hand-brushed leather jackets and cotton macs, with sheer side panels, that emphasized the designer's beloved hourglass silhouette. Or wispy chiffon tops whose butterfly-shaped sleeves fluttered as the models glided by.</p><p>Capasa also served up some surprises with color: Combinations like lemon and powder pink (!), mint and mauve (see the suede accessories), and lilac and pale blue suffused the raunchier pieces with a fresh, upbeat spirit. Which is not to say there wasn't plenty of his trademark noir, spun into curvilinear satin micro dresses, or long evening gowns in—what else?—transparent chiffon. This is fashion that favors the brave.</p></div>"
31,spring,2004,s2004,d-g,"Call it a case of around the world in eighty looks—well, not quite the entire eighty, but when you’ve checked off the matador, the cowgirl, the saloon-bar floozy, the geisha, the boxer, the Scottish lassie, sailor, cheerleader, boxer, surfer, biker chick...you get the picture.</p><p>D&amp;G’s cheerful travelogue, with its playful diversions into uniform, sportswear, and even outer space (one model gamely walked with a spoof Perspex fishbowl on her head), was all about making the sexiest, tightest, and most colorful clothes possible. With its cartoon-ish, pinup flavor, this was most certainly not a collection for fashion intellectuals; but when you’re having this much fun, who cares what the eggheads think?</p></div>"
32,spring,2004,s2004,daryl-k,"In the late 1990’s, Daryl Kerrigan’s famously skinny trousers and cool post-punk vibe made her a downtown darling with real crossover appeal. After a two-year absence from the runway (following business troubles, the closing of her stores, and the birth of her second child), hers was one of the week’s more eagerly anticipated shows.</p><p>Maybe Kerrigan was rusty from all that time off, but her spring collection was a low-spirited affair. She made the layered look—specifically, cut-and-slashed T-shirts and sweats—the core of her show, sending out dozens of variations on the theme of ripped, stitched, and ruched tops, worn alone as minidresses or over those signature slim-cut pants. The palette was resolutely urban, in shades of gray and black with occasional flashes of pink and red. A few tailored pieces, like neat jackets cut from sweatshirt material, a sharp-shouldered black cotton jacket, and black satin vests and parkas showed some of the label’s erstwhile, sexy spark. But overall, the audience was left craving the variety of Kerrigan’s former incarnation.</p></div>"
33,spring,2004,s2004,derek-lam,"Derek Lam said that he designed his sophomore collection “with a <em>woman</em>, not an ingénue, in mind,” and the names he gave his pieces drove the point home. There were “Sophia” and “Ava” dresses, as well as a “Marilyn” camisole that referenced Ms. Monroe, one of Lam’s main inspirations for the season (the other being the film <em>In the Mood for Love</em>). But for all their grown-up sophistication, the clothes were more gamine than sexpot.</p><p>The well edited eighteen-piece show featured a carnation print in slipper satin, a linen brocade shot with silver thread, and a vivid palette, worked into pieces like a cerise paper taffeta shell coat and a turquoise silk/cotton faille trench. Satin bra tops paired with Jacquard skirts were worn with heels for real sizzle; if put together with flats it would make for a flirty look. Pretty daytime options like box-pleat skirts and boyfriend sweaters gave way to the understated glamour of strapless evening dresses. Produced in Italy, Lam’s collection looks and feels expensive—and totally worth it.</p></div>"
34,spring,2004,s2004,diane-von-furstenberg,"Until <em>Sex and the City</em> picks up for its final season in January 2004, those pining for a glimpse of urban glamazons can satisfy their needs by combing through Diane von Furstenberg’s spring collection. Who knows better how to dress the Samanthas and Carries of the world but von Furstenberg, whose savvy at combining sex appeal with serious flair has made her a commercial force to be reckoned with (she’s just added cosmetics to the DVF empire). As usual, her show pulled in an A-list crowd that featured Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bush, and T-Boz, along with regulars like Bianca Jagger, Marisa Berenson, and Anh Duong.</p><p>This season, von Furstenberg and creative director Nathan Jenden were inspired by the original <em>Sex</em> symbol, the twenties flapper. They jazzed her up for the present day, though, cutting floaty chiffon dresses close to the body, cropping a tennis skirt into a mini (and producing it in perforated leather), and dip-dying a pair of white sailor’s trousers in rainbow colors. The designer is known for her love of bold prints, and she sent out a baker’s dozen, from abstract shapes to an Egyptian-inspired ibis motif. Of course, dressing for nightlife has been a top priority for the fashionably inclined of every era, so von Furstenberg provided a parade of gowns in body-hugging chiffons and slinky jerseys; perfect for letting the good times roll.</p></div>"
35,spring,2004,s2004,dkny,"Road trip! For her spring collection, Donna Karan sent the DKNY woman on a little cross-country jaunt from her New York home all the way to Malibu, armed with a suitcase full of easy, versatile, sexy looks to get her there and back again in style.</p><p>Ms. DKNY has a practical bent, so she packs light: neutral tones of khaki, gray, and navy, in easy fabrics like washed silk and cotton, jersey, and lightweight wool. Since traveling beyond the 212 area code counts as exotic in her book, she might grab a safari jacket or perhaps the loose silk trench that doubles as a dress. A few pairs of soft, low-slung pants, a slim skirt worn with a tiny yellow chiffon hoodie, or a snug silk tank (cinched with the thinnest snakeskin belt) will take her at least as far as the first rest stop.</p><p>For exploring the nightlife options across America, our heroine will throw in a couple of colorful little silk dresses, or shock the natives in a hot-hued chiffon dress or poncho—which, conveniently, becomes a beach cover-up when she finally stops to admire the sunset over the Pacific.</p></div>"
36,spring,2004,s2004,dolce-gabbana,"Let's start with the ending, since it was so great: a stage full of sparkly, colorful, drop-dead Hollywood gowns, the likes of which most designers in Italy have neglected to mention this season. Beyoncé Knowles, in the front row of Dolce &amp; Gabbana's Spring show, hyperventilated at the sight of Naomi Campbell swinging around in a mini showgirl number done entirely in spangled strands. ""Oh, I'd like the occasion to wear that!"" she exclaimed afterward.</p><p>The rest of the going was just as good, a lighthearted tiptoe through a myriad of fifties- and sixties-era summertime references. Lilly Pulitzer-meets-Pucciesque period prints (with a bit of pop art thrown in) came jumbled up in a melee of little suits, lace coats, and gorgeous georgette beaded cardigans. But don't expect ladylike from the D&amp;G boys. Their girls can't live without the opportunity to show some leg (preferably smothered in printed tights), and when they get into those curvy, lacy dresses, it's safe to assume their flowery underwear will find a way to flash out somehow.</p><p>Still, this is a lightened-up collection in one sense. Gone were the aggressive, punkish, oversexed elements Dolce &amp; Gabbana often throws into a show. (Even the signature black corsetry has been retired for the summer, turning up only as a token in crystal bands on pink.) They weren't missed. What's left is a slew of delicious separates that fit perfectly into the realm of pretty individualism everyone will be aiming for next summer.</p></div>"
37,spring,2004,s2004,donna-karan,"Donna Karan’s designs have always been aimed at the independent woman who negotiates her way through the jungle of contemporary urban life. In Karan’s terrific Spring collection, the designer took that idea literally, showing a range of great clothes that could have come from the closet of a sexy Amazon.</p><p>Windblown, and gleaming with iridescent bronzer, the models stalked on the runway in gorgeous nutty brown leathers that were cut in variations on the bomber/motorcycle style; worn over coppery silk jersey pieces; and stitched into leather “belts” big enough to double as miniskirts (on the models, anyway). Karan used silk jersey, one of her favorite fabrics, in everything from asymmetrical fitted dresses to a charming ruched retro “swim dress” (which returned later, paired with a long skirt, for evening), all in desert tones of peachy terra cotta, bone, and papery pale green.</p><p>Karan is nothing if not versatile. After the savage chic of her opening looks, she switched effortlessly to cityfied sophistication: fitted jackets in crinkly viscose, tobacco-colored silk tweed made into a suit and a slim coat, and a lovely ivory blouse with a deep ruffled collar, all accented with artisanal but feminine details like little drawstring pockets, pintucking, and frayed grosgrain ribbon. She closed with a series of ethereal dresses and gowns, some scattered with oxidized sequins, others woven from bands of fluttering shredded chiffon. Vibrant, sensuous, and wearable, it made for a celebratory closing chapter to Fashion Week.</p></div>"
38,spring,2004,s2004,dries-van-noten,"With glitter on the floorboards, dry ice in the air, and trees bursting through the great arched windows, Dries Van Noten transformed the nineteenth-century study hall of the École des Beaux-Arts into a magical hothouse and filled it with an artist’s vision.</p><p>First he sent out a series of angels in simple white cotton long smocks, waistcoats, and wide trousers. Then he shifted up a gear, with dresses that spilled ruffles and pleats galore. Next came the taupe, interspersed with beat-up silver jackets and trenchcoats. As the color seeped down the runway—from the palest lime to anthracite, putty, and every blue under the sun—so too did the fabrics. Gauzy layers, swishing silks, and sturdy linens were soon oozing decoration. Exquisite embroideries trickled down sleeves or burst over the backs of shrunken jackets. Prints became bolder, in purple, emerald, and lime, blossoming over circle skirts and fragile slipdresses. Even the accessories looked inviting: Lush silk opera capelets were slung over shoulders—the spring alternative to the fur tippet? Silver satchels curved around the hip or the derrière.</p><p>When, at the end, Van Noten’s model army surged toward the cameras, all thirty-five outfits appeared to have been dipped in ink: a complete spectrum of blue-blacks. It has become the designer’s trademark to use his genius sense of color in this way, much to the delight of his faithful clientele.</p></div>"
39,spring,2004,s2004,dsquared,"Fifties-era American bad-girl teen-kitsch at the diner: that was where Dean and Dan Caten headed for spring with their Dsquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collection. Three of their pinup heroines, all ratted bouffants, stilettos, and eyeliner, set the show’s mood by roaring onto the set—furnished with classic cars and a gang of Dean and Brando look-alikes—on the backs of a trio of Harleys.</p><p>The Catens’ Killer Kittens were a roll call of trashy minxes, from biker chicks in babydoll leathers to Playboy Bunnies in overflowing corsetry to tiara-wearing beauty queens. Underpinning the collection was a commitment to cropping: cropped pants and jeans, slung low and cut provocatively in the back; cropped jackets; and cropped skirts and shorts snipped way, way up.</p><p>Judging by the vast crowd that surged into the hangar-like space on Milan’s outskirts to bear witness to the Dsquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; show, the Caten twins are the latest, greatest designers to hit the Italian scene. Sure, this collection didn’t add anything to what has been said for years by the Versaces, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli; but then again, there’s no denying the buzz.</p></div>"
40,spring,2004,s2004,emanuel-ungaro,"Get on the gold aviators—it's sizzling out there. Giambattisa Valli has taken Ungaro to some steamy equatorial zone where all a certain girl needs in the way of clothes is a wardrobe of swimsuits and scarves to knot about her hot little bod in various ingeniously-revealing ways. Valli explored that idea by turning every poolside appearance into a dressy occasion. Using hot pink, orange, jade, and absinthe jersey and a cache of exotic printed georgette, he set to with the wrapping, draping, and the trailing ruffles.</p><p>In Valli's hands, a swimsuit can come with an attachment of a peony-printed chiffon scarf for winding across the body in a fetching way. Others had thick ropes of plaited jersey circling the neck and running between the breasts to anchor strips of clinging fabric. Even the jackets, with their cutaway fronts and slashed lapels, were tethered with crisscrossing scarves.</p><p>For evening, Latina ruffles, squiggly rose prints, smatterings of sparkle, and crystal strands continued the theme of dressing in as little as possible but for maximum impact. All the slashing, wrapping, draping, and floating asymmetries may end up melting the distinctions between sundress, bathing suit, and evening gown—but in a heated Ungaro climate, why stand on ceremony?</p></div>"
41,spring,2004,s2004,emilio-pucci,"Christian Lacroix, genius colorist and lover of all things patterned, is the designer in charge of raiding the Pucci archives in order to make the company’s style relevant today. For Spring 2004, Lacroix took purple, absinthe, lime, orange, and turquoise prints and shook them up in his fashion kaleidoscope to make little chiffon or satin dresses with asymmetric trails, funny combat-cum-harem trousers, Zouave pants, and scarf-like half-pant, half-skirt notions for tying on over swimsuits.</p><p>More than any other, Pucci is a label that comes into its own in high summer, and some of Lacroix’s swimwear was stellar—one stunning, yachtworthy number plunged from the shoulders to be gathered at the navel in a sunburst of color. There were plenty of delightful midsummer-night party dresses, and the multicolored Pucci dolly bags in soft silk were irresistible. But the collection didn’t quite hit all the high-glam spots it could have—especially in a nostalgically inclined season like this one that’s crazy for romantic prints. Lacroix could have happily edited out all the black, and a closer look at Pucci’s fifties and sixties heritage might have yielded yet more gems that were ready for a twenty-first–century revival.</p></div>"
42,spring,2004,s2004,emma-cook,"Emma Cook, a young London designer, likes to do a lot of research for her seasonal theses; but as she progresses from a sophomore to a junior she’s learning not to lay her themes on too thick. She described her Spring 2004 presentation as inspired by “old-fashioned ideas about futurism, Rodchenko, the constructivists, and 1920’s statues of ladies.”</p><p>What it meant was that Cook had worked machine-age cog motifs and photoprints of butterflies and flowers into flat cutouts that formed straps on dresses, neckpieces, and belts. Other details, like geometric, Deco-inspired leather inserts, also picked up on the Jazz-Age references that are currently preoccupying twenty-something designers the world over. Cook was aiming for a harder edge than usual, via slick black chintz coatdresses and some ultra-cropped boleros, but these served chiefly as garnish for the things she’s happiest doodling every season: little jersey dresses with a certain nonintellectual innocence about them.</p></div>"
43,spring,2004,s2004,emporio-armani,"The Emporio Armani Spring collection is essentially a briefer, perkier version of what Giorgio Armani showed for his main label. Armani’s design team (whom he now sends out to acknowledge the applause before taking his own bow) reworked the season’s nautical theme and came up with an alternative take on summery stripes, using fine-gauge knits to make flippy sweater dresses and cardigans in red, black, and white.</p><p>Those younger, go-faster stripes also appeared on the models’ swim-cap headgear, making an abstract link to the tight, stretchy dresses that were almost brief and clingy enough to compete with bathing suits. The athletic streak surfaced too in zippy, scuba-inspired bustiers and prettified racing shorts made of high-tech synthetics. It came as something of a surprise when the collection switched to a fluorescent palette, with bright multicolored bikinis followed by lime and pink dresses decorated with sixties-style plastic paillettes. But the show ended back on track with a simple, slick-to-the-body black beaded sheath dress—a much simpler option for speedy girls on the go.</p></div>"
44,spring,2004,s2004,fendi,"Forget last year’s fierce, sci-fi/medieval maidens; they’re history. Now that fashion has turned 180 degrees away from winter’s aggressive, angst-ridden armor, the ever-quixotic Karl Lagerfeld has gone back to the drawing board to sketch an alternative version to summer’s main theme of softness and femininity.</p><p>The collection was informed by the idea of circle-cutting, which showed up in the construction of jackets with flounces emphasizing the shoulder line; in petal-shaped skirts; and in cummerbunds. Lagerfeld traced out that soft geometry with contrasting piping, making clothes with an experimental feel that somehow also evoked the work of Bill Gibb and Jean Muir in 1970’s London.</p><p>Focus at Fendi is always on showcasing the company’s state-of-the-art developments in treating fur and skins. The latest how-did-they-do-that technology has produced an extraordinary transparent leather and a perforated ultra-fine suede, both of which trick the eye by narrowing the distinctions between fabric and animal by-product. It wasn’t all about science, however. Lagerfeld wrapped up the show with some cloudy, watercolor chiffons that floated on the general breeze of the summer trend.</p></div>"
45,spring,2004,s2004,frostfrench,"Scattered around the room during the party that preceded the FrostFrench show were Kate Moss and Jefferson Hack, Sam Taylor-Wood, Dan Macmillan, sundry It girls, lots of babies on knees, and some cool grannies (Kate’s mom among them). On the white tablecloths, sugar-iced cakes sat side by side with killer cocktails—a juxtaposition of the sweet with the wicked that typifies the taste of the FrostFrench London girl in more ways than one.</p><p>Sadie Frost and Jemima French opened the proceedings by sending out Jacquetta Wheeler in a cherry-sprigged white swimsuit—all fifties innocence—with a pink rubber Mackintosh shrugged on top. That knack for meshing the pretty with the perverse is what they’re all about: less a complex design process than the act of whipping up some fun with what happens to be in the wardrobe. “I don’t have the time to think out what I wear every morning,” said Sadie Frost. “But I always like that mix of feminine and tough, things you can pull on day or night.”</p><p>On the ingénue side, the girls offered forties-inspired sweetheart puff-sleeved print dresses, balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses in Ossie Clark–like seventies swirls, and outsize wooden-handled purses in the shape of granny’s knitting bags. Watch how they sex it up, though: adding perverse black inflatable arm-bands to an evening outfit of a sheer black camisole and silk knickers; or imagining how a lace-trimmed satin romper would do for daywear when pulled over a striped Lurex sweater. Throwing in some grounding pieces of rumpled cotton khaki—the odd jacket or cropped pant—did no harm, either, steering the show away from theatrics and making it simply a practical inventory of useful stuff. “We don’t want to be overshadowed by gimmicks,” said Jemima French. “We’ve moved on. We want the clothes to speak for themselves.” Even the much-publicized breakup of Frost’s marriage to Jude Law hadn’t disrupted their focus. “Sometimes,” said Frost in the face of a barrage of TV reporters’ questions, “You just have to get stronger and face situations.”</p></div>"
46,spring,2004,s2004,gianfranco-ferre,"There is something about the grandeur of conceit involved in a Gianfranco Ferré presentation; it belongs to an order long gone from fashion. Ferré will take a theme, often inspired by travel or art, and systematically work into it, color by color, pattern by pattern, showing every ingenious angle on the subject in exhaustive sequence.</p><p>For summer, his influences were a meld of the graphic works of Italian secessionist artist Vittorio Zecchin and a vague impression of South America. The associative link between the two is, apparently, a graphic pattern of circles, which Ferré treated in a multiplicity of laser-cuts on everything from organza to leather, and used to make abstract references to Latino costume. Not that Ferré's females are remotely related to the au naturel peasant; stiletto-heeled Amazon is more his style.</p><p>Ferré's woman is at her most impressive in his simplest offerings. The lean gray or pale-blue silk pantsuits with which he opened his show are masterfully cut, and with a big-collared shirt (another genre he has perfected over a lifetime) look absolutely pertinent. From there on, though, the experience of watching Ferré's thoughts about the many possibilities of laser-cutting is like taking a trip to a parallel dimension. Occasionally an item like a cardigan smothered in mother of pearl and edged with dark bands of caviar beading will pique genuine desire. But otherwise, what with the costumes and the prolix arias on various sentiments, a Ferré show has become more akin to a long night at the opera than fashion.</p></div>"
47,spring,2004,s2004,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio is forecasting an easy summer. Catching on to the light breeze of the twenties that’s blowing through fashion, he charted a course for the season using playful, nautical stripes as landmarks, guided by his career-long true north—the play of masculine and feminine styling.</p><p>Of course, Armani isn’t one to take a sailor theme literally, even when he’s using navy-and-white stripes. His distinctive hand shows in his taste for floppy, supple fabrics; and his small jackets and delicate layerings of sheer and opaque project the effortless, cheerful vibe that’s becoming a main message of the season.</p><p>In his lightened-up mood Armani has come to terms with showing some skin, as with slouchy, midriff-baring pants and leggy little dresses (the standouts came with sequined stripes). And was that a sense of whimsy peeking through in the embellishments—the Schiaparelliesque starfish, crabs, and lobsters sprinkled on tanks and bags? The collection navigated that touch of surrealist humor, too, without sailing off course.</p></div>"
48,spring,2004,s2004,givenchy,"With the Carpenters in the air, it was clear before a model set foot on the rustic flagstone runway that this was not going to be one of the disco glitzfests Julien Macdonald habitually throws for his own label in London. Sure enough, the first girl out was wearing a drifty, seventies-era tiered cream cheesecloth tent banded with inserts of macramé and tasseled shoulder straps, followed by a dusty-pink crinkled petticoat dress pulled in with crisscrossed lacing under the bust.</p><p>Macdonald tightened up his romantic hippy theme with a section of shrunken washed cotton bellhop jackets and biker leathers sweetened in tan leather and cream canvas, sometimes layered atop long blouses and cropped pants. Other modernizing touches, among all the airy gauze and ombré-dyed silk, were the eye-catching Givenchy bags—outsized shoulder-slung satchels loaded with heavy-duty straps and chunky leather braids, or giant wooden-handled semi-circular bags in squashy skins.</p><p>It made for a pretty summer collection that showcased some of Macdonald's talent with knit (loosely crocheted fishing-net cardigans, for example) and included the sort of luxury details French women like when summering around the Mediterranean. The season-to-season continuity of brand image remains a point of confusion, though, as this collection seems poles apart from the strictly constructed homages to Audrey Hepburn that Macdonald has been producing for Givenchy Haute Couture.</p></div>"
49,spring,2004,s2004,gucci,"Who is the Gucci girl this season? “She’s eye candy!”Tom Ford laughed backstage. Of course she is. Glamour and provocation are at the core of the sex machine Ford has built at Gucci and, in a time when the pleasure principle is driving fashion, he knows how to push all the right buttons. He kicked things off with a little contradiction: silky track pants with a sporty ribbon running down the side and sloppy, semi-sheer tees, put together with exquisitely classy jackets and high gold sandals. Call it casual/couture, revved up with a flash of gotta-have-it trash in the all-important accessory department.</p><p>Over the last few seasons, as Ford has immersed himself in the culture of couture at Saint Laurent, his focus on cut and detail has become intense. That heightened awareness showed up in the delicious Gucci spring jacket—a feminine, body-hugging number with tiny, pleated fans forming a peplum in back—and in the minute waffles of tucks and pleats inserted into nude satins, which turned up in pants, jackets, and dresses.</p><p>But back to the eye-candy issue. For after dark, Ford produced a parade of red-carpet cuties, snuggled in feathery swan’s-down boleros (in pristine white, egg-yolk yellow, or fuchsia) over curvily constructed knee-length chiffons. For the less sweet-toothed, he sent out the glitter snakes—serpentine crystal motifs wound around the torso or up the arms of black dresses. That's all strictly for high-flying candies, of course. For the rest of us, there are always the bags: madly excessive constructions involving purple, green, and bronze metallic snakes writhing decadently over signature GGs—more temptation than any girl can stand.</p></div>"
50,spring,2004,s2004,haider-ackermann,"The season is shaping up to be a pretty one, full of floaty dresses, fizzy prints, and eye-popping color. But trust a Belgian—or, in this case, a Belgian-trained, Colombian-born Frenchman—to deliver a more austere approach to spring/summer.</p><p>Despite the stark palette of petrol blue, graphite, black, and white, Haider Ackermann’s collection was both light and desirable. His inspiration? ""The street,"" he said simply. ""And elegance."" For the former, read sporty perforated synthetics cut into skinny racer-back vests and harem pants. And for the latter? That would be any one of his dresses—an effortless, elongated blue sweater, say, or a sinuous gray jersey wrap-over style.</p><p>Although Ackermann did veer down a few mean streets with his trickier pieces—softly strapped bondage trousers, tough black leather shorts, and a number of raw-hemmed pencil skirts—he never hit a dead end in a collection that was cool and surprisingly graceful, albeit with a dark soul.</p></div>"
51,spring,2004,s2004,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow gets fired up by the beauty of industrial processes, by the fashion possibilities of non-fashion materials, and by the kaleidoscopic wonders that flash across our computer screens. His Spring collection was inspired by hi-tech yachting tackle, and featured a piece of digital performance art by the team of Warren du Preez and Nick Thornton Jones.</p><p>What sets Morrow apart is his ability to translate all that up-to-the-minute experimentalism into sensuous, wearable clothing that respects couture values. The yachting hardware, like chunky ropes threaded through huge steel eyelets, literally anchored a collection that was otherwise light as a breeze—in both form and fabric. Sport jackets made out of transparent gold nylon cellophane fluttered like tissue. Electroplated nylon was cut into iridescent tailored jackets, in indescribably subtle shades of metallic chartreuse or peach, light enough to crumple into the palm of a hand. Other jackets came with solid fronts, and backs made of sheer sports-style mesh ruched onto a strip of patterned material that followed the spine.</p><p>The whole collection, with its delicate colors, metallic effects, and rigorous geometry, turned out to have been made without a single stitch: Everything was pieced together via ultrasonic welding. That, of course, is a feat in itself, but here’s the best thing: For all its amazing modernity, the show never tipped over into one of those all-too-painful exercises in intellectual avant-gardism. Morrow is one fashion boffin who also loves to dress women.</p></div>"
52,spring,2004,s2004,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang based his collection on dragonflies. What set him off, he said before the show, was “the lightness of structure, the iridescent color.” Whatever his references, they always become meshed into the recognizable House of Lang signatures: pared-away structures; straps; bits and pieces of T-shirts; and tailoring. That was all apparent in an opening section of layered beige and white, with delicate bandages loosely wrapping pants, and holey T-shirts under a few of his slim suits.</p><p>Last season’s shadow of militaristic strictness and aggression has lifted. In place of the darkness, there are complex but abbreviated shapes and a concentration on working with color—brick red, beige, purple, and green, with sudden flashes of reflective materials and slithery, synthetic translucencies. Some of Lang’s abstracted forms have become far removed from any recognizable function. Odd hip-slung devices came with metallic protrusions on one side, tied on with jersey wraps. Other garments looked like upside-down sweaters, dangling in place of skirts.</p><p>His best silhouettes were tiny, formfitting knit dresses with a contrasting underlayer of sheer, shiny fabric that escaped in miniscule gathered flips. In the end, though, for all the lightness and sensitivity of color in this collection, Lang’s imagination has drifted into obsessing over aesthetic details. In the old days, grown women used to cry over how his pants, tanks, jackets, and coats offered such coolly simple solutions for everyday dressing. Now, for all the vision of beauty he presents, there’s a sense that they’re left on the sidelines, pining.</p></div>"
53,spring,2004,s2004,imitation-of-christ,"""I've been watching a lot of old movies,"" said Tara Subkoff after her spring show, a love letter to the glamour and supposed innocence of black-and-white cinema.</p><p>The production was preceded by a tap routine with a Shirley Temple look-alike, who danced to a recording of Miss Temple's <em>You Gotta Eat Your Spinach, Baby</em>; paused for an interlude during which two ballroom dancers performed to Fred Astaire's rendition of <em>Puttin' on the Ritz</em>; and finally closed out with a kiss between models.</p><p>And so to the clothes, which were shown in a series of vignettes, beginning with black-and-white pieces and eventually incorporating some pastel colors. The first half of the presentation featured looks designed, rather than reclaimed, by Subkoff, and included printed T-shirt dresses, mini-togas, and twenties-inspired tennis outfits, mostly in knit fabrics—all in all, a successful sequel to the all-gray collection she launched last season. The second half was authentic vintage, with that signature Imitation of Christ twist. With Marlene Dietrich on the big screen behind them, the models, accompanied by tuxedoed swells, frolicked in satiny dresses, many with lingerie details, some with beading, and some with a Grecian/goddess feel. The result? Full-on glamour inspired by old Hollywood, but motivated by the new—specifically, said the Los Angeles-based Subkoff, by ""sweet, good, beautiful"" girls like Renée Zellweger and Scarlett Johansson, who have opportunities galore for steppin' out in style.</p></div>"
54,spring,2004,s2004,jean-paul-gaultier,"For spring, Jean Paul Gaultier reprised a few of his favorite obsessions—themes he's been toying with since the eighties when he was first dubbed an <em>enfant terrible</em>.</p><p>His chief fixation, of course, is the corset. Incredible, really, the mileage he's gotten out of a single garment. More remarkable still is that it continues to thrill and inspire him. But this time around, the effect was more sculptural than Madonna-sexy, with jackets that sucked in the waist and skirts that clutched the behind, all lashed with intricate lacing. It was great to see this masterful couturier use his infinite skills in the ready-to-wear line—although at times, the very structure of these exquisitely crafted pieces seemed a little out of step with a season bent on floaty sweet nothings.</p><p>Gaultier got around that conundrum with his saloon girls who sported frothy chiffon dresses beneath their corset casings, or long, languid aprons with their flashy-colored cowgirl boots. There were a few punks too, sans corsets, seemingly tattooed with his trademark body stockings worn beneath wafting parkas. And, as ever, the designer issued his masculine/feminine tailoring. Nobody does an ivory pinstriped suit, or a corset, for that matter, quite like Gaultier.</p></div>"
55,spring,2004,s2004,jens-laugesen,"Sure, the current mood may have turned to optimism and femininity—but who’s going to dress all the tomboys out there who will never feel pretty in pink? Hopes were high for Jens Laugesen, a Danish-born designer educated in Paris and at Central Saint Martins. The impressively organized Laugesen has already delivered two on-the-money collections full of pieces that fit nicely into the military/utility tendency.</p><p>Sad to say, those who turned up eager to witness a new fashion visionary—or even find a sharp new angle on a well-established subcult—went away nonplussed, if not exasperated. Laugesen works in cut-up, monochromatic T-shirts, sweats, knits, and deconstructed tailoring. But his first look, a loose jacket over leggings in layers of cream and gray and festooned with hanging straps, carried a distinct air of déjà vu. As he progressed into canvas leggings heavily cross-laced at the back, the comparisons with collections shown last season—most obviously, the work of Helmut Lang—were painfully unavoidable.</p><p>There may have been some oversized knits and overgrown vests that stood out among the layers, but however well Laugesen is capable of executing individual pieces, he can’t escape the expectations that face every young designer who ventures onto the runway. Next season, Laugesen should work out what he has to say and articulate it in a voice that is his alone.</p></div>"
56,spring,2004,s2004,jil-sander,"Tensions ran high during a lengthy preshow wait for Jil Sander’s highly-anticipated return to the runway. What would this former exemplar of nineties minimalism have to say to a world so drastically altered from the one she left three years ago? Would her reputation for rigor and abstract inventiveness still stand up? From her opening look—a delicate white cotton full-skirted dress with a tracery of sepia flowers printed on the bodice—it was obvious Sander has changed, but without losing herself.</p><p>Her many faithful followers were always attracted to the fact that Sander designed clothes for an intelligent female sensibility, creating a practical laundry list of those most-difficult-to-find simplicities: a great white shirt, wonderful sweaters, a well-cut pantsuit. Coming back with a collection that emphasizes delicacy and femininity isn’t necessarily a contradiction of all that. “I feel I’ve grown up since I’ve been away,” she said, “and at the same time, I’ve become really interested in the joyful idea of being a woman. Stepping out for a little to watch the world has made me feel lighter.” That means good-bye to too much overwrought seriousness; Sander, like many of her working constituents, is conscious of the need to strike an emotional balance in life. But that hasn’t shaken her belief in the integrity of the white shirt, or the perfectly-flattering V-neck sweater. It just means that what she puts with them now might be a crinkly semi-sheer silk skirt, or a refined version of a flounced petticoat.</p><p>Sander’s legendary insistence on using experimental fabrics and techniques is still very much apparent in her use of print, which turned up here as paint-rollered effects on dresses, some with their seams inverted and pressed flat. Her refined taste was present too in the colors she chose: cloudy gray, watery lemon, pale sage, and matte gold amid the predominant white. Miuccia Prada and her husband, Prada head Patrizio Bertelli watched from backstage; afterward, Bertelli, who owns Sander’s company, said, “It was a very positive, serene collection. It’s wonderful to welcome her back to the family.” A sentiment likely to be shared by Sander’s loyal customers everywhere.</p></div>"
57,spring,2004,s2004,jill-stuart,"Since half of Jill Stuart’s SoHo shop is dedicated to the designer’s vintage finds, it's no surprise that many intricate details typical of these pieces should find their way into her spring collection. This season Stuart traveled back in time from her fall show, a celebration of sixties style, to the twenties and thirties, with a strong focus on evening wear. Results varied from an overly derivative silver-beaded flapper dress to a scrumptious gown constructed from pink petals that, though vintage-inspired, looked perfect for right now.</p><p>For day Stuart showed smart trenches, cut above the knee, in black and the peachy pink that is becoming a touchstone of the season, as well as tightly pleated minis in black and a red-and-blue floral that bloomed here and there throughout the show. Ribbons, ruching, and lace insets were among the many lingerie details that updated sporty pieces like bra tops, a pink sweatshirt/bed jacket (tied asymmetrically with a blue grosgrain ribbon), and the shrunken blue blazers that Stuart paired with shorts. For those in the swim, there were a variety of Hollywood-glamorous bathing suits with ruching, bows, and back zips that would look as good on the silver screen as they will poolside at the Chateau Marmont.</p></div>"
58,spring,2004,s2004,john-galliano,"Victorian dolls and Brooke Shields in <em>Pretty Baby</em>: Those were the not-so-innocent fancies that caused John Galliano to get into cream puffs and frills for summer. His first model teetered out in a bustled-up romper confection with overblown transparent sleeves, white stockings and suspenders, and a two-foot pompadour. Her girlie cohorts followed, gussied up in itsy eyelet tutus, marabou-trimmed rosebud-print corsetry, fluttery panties, white knee socks, and all manner of coquettish bows, rosettes, and ribbons.</p><p>After the puff sleeves and baby dolls, Galliano sent out some of his more familiar nineteenth-century bordello denizens in fuchsia corsetry and long <em>Moulin Rouge</em> cutaway flounces. Backstage, the designer insisted that his bubbly summer follies are there simply to explore a new proportion. “It's something I had to do to get to the next phase,” he explained, “like the cardboard cutout show I did a few seasons ago.” Meanwhile, Galliano analysts know to search for those tantalizing signs of the delicacies he reserves for commercial release—like a fragile white lace blouse, or a lilac camisole suspended loosely from bow-trimmed ribbons. And as for the teensy colored purses, swinging from grosgrain straps? Immediately, deliciously consumable.</p></div>"
59,spring,2004,s2004,jonathan-saunders,"Scottish-born designer Jonathan Saunders is one of the freshest discoveries on the London scene, having graduated from Central Saint Martins a mere three years ago. For his second collection, he tapped into the current feel for zingy colors and prints, wrapping delightful, intricately engineered patterns around Alaïa-inspired stretch pieces and cutting printed chiffon into deliciously feminine little dresses.</p><p>Saunders referenced M.C. Escher, the Italian thirties futurist Vasselli, and nineties rave culture, mixed them into a vivid palette of clear blues, greens, yellow, orange, and violet, and emerged with a look that could only have been imagined by a child of the digital age. His taut, strapless all-in-ones and tube dresses featured complex geometric patterns, ombré shading, and graphic lines which broke into different configurations as they ran over each zone of the anatomy. Those simple, lithe shapes, partly derived from dancewear, were counterpointed by floaty dresses caught into beautifully pintucked bodices or full skirts gathered onto jersey yokes.</p><p>Saunders’s talents as a colorist and pattern-meister are already being tapped by the major labels; his contribution to Alexander McQueen’s stunning bird-of-paradise prints of last summer have since earned him consultancies at both Pucci and Chloé. But with this young, vibrantly modern collection, he’s on the brink of winning well-deserved recognition in his own right.</p></div>"
60,spring,2004,s2004,julien-macdonald,"Seven days a week, British tabloid papers run multiple pages of local TV stars, popstrels, It girls, lad-mag models, and soap actresses posing on red carpets (and, later, falling out of nightclubs and whatever microscopic garments they might have selected for the occasion). This is celebrity, Brit-style, a realm in which the name of Julien Macdonald figures as large as legends like Versace and Roberto Cavalli.</p><p>His opening look—Naomi Campbell in a white jacket, black cutaway swimsuit, and sky-high leather laced-up boots—has a good chance of being replicated, literally, by British girls in the clubs of Ibiza and Rhodes next summer. His minute spangled cobweb dresses, sprayed-on white pantsuits and multicoloured chiffon beach cover-ups (a fashion tautology if ever there was one) will be in heavy demand from every competitive celeb-bod in Britain. In a way, then, Macdonald is far more famous and influential than any of his indigenous peers who aspire to change the course of fashion.</p><p>Whether his idea of glamour will ever cut it on an international stage is of course, another question—but one that appears to trouble him not a jot. His celebrity status has brought him business, including multiple sponsorships and a new deal with Pretty Polly to translate his signature knits into cobwebby tights. And he’s certainly not suffering from lack of attention. Backstage after his show, surrounded by a posse of adoring models with red-vinyl lips and a mob of TV crews, the designer declared: “It’s all about having a good time.” Macdonald clearly knows his audience.</p></div>"
61,spring,2004,s2004,junya-watanabe,"Bold. Brilliant. For spring/summer, Junya Watanabe took us on a tour of the body, mapping out new territory on the torso, exploring new lines beneath the waist. As might be expected from the Comme des Garçons protégé, models resembled otherworldly creatures—all sporting identical high, sleek, black wigs and alabaster skin, the ideal canvas on which to build his layers of inventiveness.</p><p>He started with a series of sporty, second-skin undergarments—cropped tanks and cycling shorts—beneath tailored jackets cut from whisker-fine polyester. But then Watanabe’s experiment truly began to develop. Layer by layer, piece by piece, the body was eventually camouflaged by squares and diamonds and dots that spiraled in ever more complex confections. There were white dots the circumference of espresso cups dancing across black dresses, and polka dots of all dimensions were sliced and scattered across fluid, paneled skirts. Sheer gray bird’s-eye check jackets clung to the ribs, their intricate seams tracing the bones beneath. (Diagrams should be offered to Watanabe-wearers, as the point of entry to some of these was hard to detect).</p><p>The only respite from the stark black, white, and gray came in a single trapeze-shaped silky dress covered in diamonds of tan, chocolate, and cream. One could only wonder what this collection might have been had the designer indulged us with his kaleidoscopic sense of color. Maybe next season.</p></div>"
62,spring,2004,s2004,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole opened his Spring 2004 fashion show with a short film that celebrated his twenty years in the business. Most of that time Cole was solely (pun intended) a shoe designer, but in recent years he’s been pushing into new categories, like fragrance and fashion.</p><p>For all his tongue-in-cheek advertising, Cole doesn’t fool around when it comes to fashion. His customer wants moderately hip, uncomplicated clothes, which the designer provides by putting a fresh twist on reliable classics. Last season, he was squarely in the mod camp; for Spring, he went over to the preppy side, showing big V-neck sweaters layered over crisp white shorts and worn with slim trousers or Bermuda shorts. Colors were neutral and muted—shades of gray, taupe, khaki, white—with an occasional splash of canary yellow or cobalt blue. Some charmeuse minidresses added a touch of glam, but for the most part it was an appealingly practical collection.</p></div>"
63,spring,2004,s2004,kim-jones,"The whirlwind of London’s designer hype traditionally starts in grungy East End underground clubs, the kind that get going way after dark and where only the young and brave dare venture. This season, Kim Jones was the name being tossed around by the seasonal cyclone. A menswear designer, it was rumored he had something new to say for women.</p><p>New or not, at least he has a fresh reference point: for his first women’s collection, Jones incorporated aspects of nineties youth culture on top of the 1980’s references already in heavy circulation. “Rave festivals—that was when I first started going out,” he said, to explain the striped Peruvian fabrics that were spliced into a fifteen-look collection of cropped jackets, colorful curvy dresses, and ruched leggings that also invoked that other totemic figure of the season, Azzedine Alaïa.</p><p>Although all the women’s pieces will be sold under the Kim Jones label, the collaborative-minded Jones didn’t actually design the collection; that was done, quite openly, by his pal Marios Schwab, a recent Central Saint Martins graduate. Jones, meanwhile, concentrated on menswear ideas like making pants out of patched-together handkerchiefs. The whole endeavor has the authentic air of the amateur start-up that doesn’t quite make sense or play by the rules. Partly annoying, partly intriguing; but then again, definitely on the radar for next season.</p></div>"
64,spring,2004,s2004,krizia,"Curiosity over the lines of succession at well-established houses is becoming one of fashion’s favorite preoccupations. What happens when a designer reaches a point in life where stepping back seems only natural? And how can a label be injected with new energy, without losing its singularity? Mariuccia Mandelli, who is still very much hands-on in her own design room, has called in the London designer Hamish Morrow to work through those questions over the last two seasons at Krizia, and she clearly has confidence in his talent; at the end of her Spring 2004 show, she brought him out in front of the audience to take a joint bow.</p><p>Leafing through the results of their collaboration backstage, Mandelli pointed out the ""sport chic"" elements that made it into the collection. Morrow, who has his own fledgling line back home in London, is a modernist with an interest in technical fabrics, and his hand was evident in details like leather parachute harnesses on dresses and swimwear. His eye for bright, slightly jarring color combinations showed up, too, in tonal placings of shades of green, orange, and yellow. Mandelli also drew attention to the high-tech materials that can only be produced in Italy—modern luxe inventions like steel gauze (made into light, crinkly trenches and jackets) and washable leather, which Morrow used for biker pants. White leather zippered bodices and body-hugging dresses, meanwhile, projected a souped-up sexiness rather than Morrow’s instinctive taste for abstraction. Only time will tell whether this relationship will ensure a sound future direction for the house. But it’s certainly an interesting start.</p></div>"
65,spring,2004,s2004,lagerfeld-gallery,"""Graphic effects!"" exclaimed the designer backstage before he was swamped by well-wishers. Right. And there were plenty of them in his Spring collection, from the waspish silhouettes to the laser-sharp pleated dresses and bold prints.</p><p>Lagerfeld flitted from one theme to the next in his quest for a striking statement. Tough-shouldered jackets and stiff little skirts in croc-stamped leather were swiftly replaced by a fleet of sinuous, slithering sheath dresses—some with Grecian folds, others that clasped at the shoulder with a silver buckle. Next up, a couple of bikini-clad beach babes, whose jersey robes fell to the floor at the pull of a strap. Then came the faded denim: a natty cropped jacket here, a curvy pinafore there. These were hotly pursued by dainty chiffon dresses—in chocolate, black, or coral—given a graphic twist with shoulder straps and waistbands cut from sparkling shagreen.</p><p>Of course, the proceedings wouldn't be complete without the designer's obligatory strict black suits, worn with crisp white shirts, high starched collars, thin black neckties, and super-svelte skirts of both the mini and pencil persuasion. Nor would the show be the same without one of Lagerfeld's witty, self-mocking edicts: T-shirts, as slender as the designer himself, were branded with the message ""4 Slim People."" As if there was any doubt.</p></div>"
66,spring,2004,s2004,lanvin,"For spring, Alber Elbaz abandoned his concern with intricate surfaces and dainty jeweling. Instead, like several other designers in Paris, he went back to the drawing board of couture fundamentals in an effort to pull something modern-looking out of old-school methods. His particular focus for Lanvin was seamless draping, possibly the trickiest of all technical challenges. Elbaz also grasped at the slippery subject of slinky, thirties-era glamour—something that has emerged as a preoccupation of the season. Some of it worked, but not on every level.</p><p>The designer wrapped satin and taffeta around the body, with the edges of the fabric tied in loose, flat bows or emerging as bustles, ripples along spine lines, or asymmetric flicks flying out from the side of a dress. To emphasize the flow, surface detail was limited to two devices for holding everything in place: strategically placed hooks and eyes, and flat metal snaps. Edges were left raw.</p><p>The problem with this apparent simplicity is that it calls more attention to the aesthetic decisions made about color, accessories, and other intangibles of styling. Some of the dresses in silver or bronze sequins, with their twisted plunge necklines, looked effortlessly divine and right in step with the season. Ditto the pieces in lingerie-pale pink, coral, or peacock-blue satin. Yet Elbaz only demonstrated how hard it is to do charmeuse (and charm) when he brought on searing yellow, royal blue, or emerald, and his treatment of flashy gold sequins was equally jarring. What also escaped were crucial incidentals like footwear that can make a collection coalesce (knee-high black spiked boots, for example, clunked). Close up, there were many extraordinary items; but now Elbaz needs to mold and edit his technique to an image that's completely satisfying.</p></div>"
67,spring,2004,s2004,louis-vuitton,"When Marc Jacobs is on form at Louis Vuitton, he can make clothes so effortlessly, eclectically right that it leaves the audience tingling. In a season when old-time movie glamour, an adoration for saturated color, lovely textures, and glints of glitter are the materials of a woman’s fantasies, Jacobs had the last word on making all of those work every day—and every night, for that matter.</p><p>The sensation started the minute the auditorium darkened; music pumped and a projection of an LV monogram covered the entire space including the figure of the first advancing model. She was wearing an absinthe draped silk top with a little silk crepe de chine peacock-blue skirt and a pair of suede platforms, carrying one of the neat new LV monogrammed bags (this season, its chunky straps are picked out in juicy colors or gold). Jacobs worked to bring an antique richness to the clothes by using panne velvet, pressed sequins, and gold and silver lamé, but it never became overdone or literally vintage. The sequins could turn up banded onto a wear-in-the-street glazed linen trenchcoat, the gold lamé made into a cute blouse/jacket too great to save for special occasions. With the inclusion of pieces like Clam diggers and sailor pants for practicality, and items like small decorative dresses, tap pants, and a pale Lurex swimsuit for insane temptation, it was a collection that gelled all the elements of the way a young woman wants to look and feel.</p><p>That is Jacobs’s knack, although at Vuitton he generously reflects accolades back on his hip behind-the-scenes team. “It’s the things we like playing with, our favorite things,” he said afterward. “But it’s always about our favorite things of the moment.” Sometimes the best collections happen when designers don’t torture themselves to make a statement. This season, fashion is essentially about nothing more cerebral than finding a way to feel and look happy—and Marc Jacobs nailed it.</p></div>"
68,spring,2004,s2004,luca-luca,"On the heels of his all-black winter show, Luca Orlandi fervently embraced femininity and Mediterranean-inspired color for spring. His aim, he said, was ""to create the effect of a summer dream,"" and the music—<em>Love to Love You Baby</em> mixed with Vive la Fête and some steamy, heavy-breathing numbers—made it clear exactly what kind of reverie the designer had in mind.</p><p>Orlandi’s lingerie-inspired collection was worn by bed-headed models who heated up the runway in peach-colored silk satin tops, skirts, and jackets that were ruched, strapped, and corset-laced every which way. (The most interesting variation on the theme was a shrunken cap-sleeved, ruched leather jacket worn by Alek Wek.) There was no shortage of South Beach-ready club wear, from skin-baring, open-backed tops and halters paired with flowing silk pants, to the pajama-style jumpsuits which closed the show. Orlandi also nodded to the goddess look, offering long jersey dresses like a one-shouldered piece worn by Oluchi. For those who like it hot (the audience included T-Boz, Seal, Tweet, Ingrid Casares, Garcelle Beauvais, Roberto Cavalli, and Anthony Kiedis) there was plenty to applaud.</p></div>"
69,spring,2004,s2004,luella,"London-based Luella Bartley designed her collection this past summer as Europe was enduring its vicious heat wave and she was coming to the end of her pregnancy. So it’s no surprise that her spring line was full of breezy pieces meant to float off the body while keeping spirits from wilting.</p><p>The title of the collection was “a tribe called Luella,” a group which clearly shares some anthropological traits with the clan of Bananarama: There were outsized overalls worn over tiny tops; loose, lightweight cotton and silk blouses; dresses wrapped with ropy braided belts; and generously cut menswear pieces, like a giant V-neck sweater worn as a mini or a billowing blue cotton shirt with soft drawstring trousers. And though there were some tweeds worked into the mix, they steered clear of serious; Luella’s tiny minis and flaring boleros piped in Day-Glo are in no danger of being mistaken for Chanel (although her increasingly great handbags could start their own cult).</p><p>For decoration, Bartley strung her models in fetishes of all kinds: cheery leather skulls, crossbones, smiley faces, and hearts, as well as a few tiny Net MD Walkmans supplied by her corporate sponsor, Sony. If 2004 brings another cruel, cruel summer, at least the Bartley tribe will be dressed for it.</p></div>"
70,spring,2004,s2004,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"For his secondary line, Marc by Marc Jacobs, the designer habitually—and joyfully—recalls a time and a place most people are glad to forget: the hallways of Public High School U.S.A., circa 1979. Some seasons he re-thinks the clean-cut preppy set, while other times he zeroes in on the social fringe. For Spring 2004 he conjured tough boys and bad girls, the kind who get suspended for smoking and who put together their wardrobes from the army-navy store and the bins at Goodwill.</p><p>To a headbanging soundtrack (with the volume turned up to 11), Jacobs sent a torrent of punked-out girls and guys racing down the runway in his trademark, casually assembled collages. The first look included satin hot pants, layered T-shirts, a big canvas ballet bag, a trailing scarf, and a pair of sparkly combat boots. In contrast to the controlled palette and minimal adornment of his main line, Jacobs let loose here, mixing blue, pink, green, orange, black, and gold in a single outfit, and piling on scarves, bags, silkscreen patterns, embroidery, and lots of tiny pins. Under his masterful direction, it all looked cooler than cool. More importantly, his signature combinations included plenty of great pieces for grownups: slouchy cotton twill trousers, pretty floral dresses, skimpy ribbed T-shirts to wear under an artfully beat-up denim or corduroy jacket. But as fertile an inspiration as high school clearly is, wouldn’t it be nice to see what Marc would look like if it grew up and went to college?</p></div>"
71,spring,2004,s2004,marc-jacobs,"Packed onto metal bleachers, waiting late into the night in a sweltering auditorium, fanning themselves with damp program notes—it would have taken quite a presentation to lift the weary spirits of the audience members at Marc Jacobs. Instead of rousing the crowd with a high-energy sequel to his color-packed, tightly constructed Fall show, however, Jacobs soothed the savage mood with a sweet confection of a collection, full of pretty clothes and gentle colors.</p><p>It didn’t hurt that the first model out was the rarely sighted Gisele (greeted like a returning rock star), or that Beyoncé was on the soundtrack, or that the clothes were easy to like. Jacobs started his design career at Perry Ellis, whose insouciant take on sportswear and relaxed tailoring defined an era, and tonight he scattered references to Ellis throughout. Loose, menswear-tailored linen trousers and rolled-up seersucker shorts were worn with soft ballerina-wrap cashmere sweaters, or striped silk shirts feminized with scraps of ruffle. Deep-blue chenille was knitted wittily into “denim” jackets and coats, sometimes worn with slim cropped tuxedo pants.</p><p>Of course, there was plenty of present-day Jacobs, too. Lovely floral sundresses came in pinks and aquas, panne velvet skirts in muted blues and greens. There were gauzy sheer dresses with pintucking and stacks of rough-edged ruffles, a wonderful gilded trench coat, and a few saucy, sequined minis. And when Gisele closed the night in a swishy pink gown, the roar of applause showed that all was forgiven.</p></div>"
72,spring,2004,s2004,marni,"Consuelo Castiglioni’s early Marni collections sometimes looked like the artlessly lovely results of a girl’s home dressmaking classes, but she has moved on from all those seasons of naïve rosebud cottons, evolving to a point of graceful accomplishment. And while her work has always been distinguished by her affection for vintage-style fabrics and love of color and print, she also knows how to work those feelings in the right seasonal direction. For spring, she conjured a delightfully easy, nonliteral look out of the current obsession with the fifties.</p><p>A salmon pink-striped three-quarter sleeved coat opened the show, worn over a silky skirt in beige with white polka dots. Another coat, this one in lime, came with the polka dots billowing out from a loose lining. The deft color mixes—teal, turquoise, mint, raspberry, biscuit, and silver—looked mouth-watering, as did the prints: amusing versions of scribbly fifties curtain material, made into witty plastic swimsuits and canvas duffel bags.</p><p>The Marni twist—quite literally—came in the curved cutting and piecing techniques Castiglioni used to skew the retro silhouette, producing intriguingly puffy, rounded sleeves and dropped shoulder lines in jackets and coats; sexy, narrow bias-cut striped pants; and subtly rethought T-shirts and knits. But for all the experimentation—which also showed up in the technically enhanced, laundered couture fabrics—this was a collection that made summer dressing look beautiful and effortless.</p></div>"
73,spring,2004,s2004,martin-grant,"""He's just great. His clothes are exquisite,"" raved Lee Radziwill, one of Martin Grant's more high-profile fans, who arrived at the designer's show (held in a cloistered courtyard) wearing one of his tomato suede jackets. It wasn't hard to see why the Australian designer holds such appeal for the likes of Radziwill; his collection was the epitome of chic. And though it might be ready-to-wear, every piece—every stitch, even—showed a zeal for the craft of couture. From the first anthracite satin minitrench to the knife-pleated Lurex skirts worn with backless chiffon halters or narrow crepe jackets with pushed up sleeves, Grant's clothes were impeccable. Yes, they're Park Avenue grand—perfect for those polite ladies who never have a hair or hemline out of place. That's not to say they won't appeal to younger high-maintenance types too. It might be old-school technique, but the effect was dynamic and contemporary, without any need for gimmicks or fuss.</p><p>Backstage, the designer said the collection was inspired by his grandmother, who taught him to sew. ""Her thing was the shirtdress,"" he said. ""She always wore them."" His versions served as the bedrock of his collection, cut narrow, never tight, in long and mini proportions. But graceful glamour ended the show in the form of a strapless gown in wavy chiffon ruffles. If ever a Hollywood star needed some red carpet fashion credibility, she could do well to start here.</p></div>"
74,spring,2004,s2004,martine-sitbon,"""I wanted to take couture elements, like bows and flowers, but do them in a spontaneous, modern, comfortable way,"" explained Martine Sitbon. Hardly the torturously intellectual talk of a respected French modernist, but then this is Paris, Spring 2004, and designers everywhere are lightening up their acts.</p><p>Sitbon was no exception. For a section of clothes made from parachute silk, she raided the colors from the makeup counter—powdery blush, baby blue, a highlight of lime, lipstick magenta. But while the sweatshirts, ruched-sleeved parkas, and ice-skating skirts looked pretty, easy, and undemanding, some of the repetitive dresses did not: Loose cummerbunds bulked up the hips and large silk flowers were plonked on thighs, a little <em>too</em> spontaneously. Will the Sitbon customer really want to wear dresses so sugary sweet they resembled upside-down tulips? Will even her die-hard fans snap up the aprons covered in chiffon blooms?</p><p>Fear not, all you Sitbon lovers. Her alternative—a play on masculine/feminine tailoring—gave the collection balance and rescued it from the saccharine realms of cotton-candy couture. Crisp white frock coats, backless waistcoats, and wide cream trousers looked smart, imaginative, and sexy, as did the last few slithery black satin sheaths with twisted velvet straps—just the sort of strong signature pieces that her customers know and love.</p></div>"
75,spring,2004,s2004,matthew-williamson,"Like planets orbiting the sun, trends are constantly circling the fashion universe, and lucky is the designer who happens to be in the right place when his stars align. Brit favorite Matthew Williamson, who has been doing colorful and sexy his whole career, is perfectly positioned to enjoy the swingy, tropical feeling and lingerie-infused moments that are dominating New York’s runways.</p><p>That’s a good thing, since Williamson, whose first flagship store will open in London next year, would probably rather die than do, say, careerwear or minimalism. His opening outfit summed up his “where’s the party” attitude: a crisp white trapeze coat and a pair of jeans ornamented with tiny pompons on the back pockets. The whites, and some soft gray corduroy, were a foundation for a collection bursting with colors like cobalt blue, pink, and purple, as well as prints (especially a vivid peacock motif) and embroideries. The designer used chiffons, satins, and bold Jacquards to make butterfly-sleeve tops, cowboy shirts, and trim, decorative coats, and gave a few of his models big snakeskin satchels in—what else?—metallic lamé. (The same material showed up in his shoes, Williamson’s first foray into footwear.)</p><p>There were a couple of questionable pieces, like the poorly constructed embroidered dresses that closed the proceedings. But overall, Williamson provided plenty of choices for society girls and celebs (like Mischa Barton of <em>The O.C.</em>, seated front row) to wear out on the town.</p></div>"
76,spring,2004,s2004,max-mara,"One of Italy’s oldest ready-to-wear companies, MaxMara made its name in the fifties, mainly as a purveyor of quality coats, and is still motoring on that business today, selling stylish outerwear and tailoring to women all over the world. The challenge faced by the label each season is how to spin a trend around its solid brand franchise, and build it into something that makes a sustained statement as a runway collection.</p><p>The core idea for spring was easy enough to spot: soft, washed materials like canvas and leather, made into slouchy-pocketed jackets, trenches, and short, puffy bombers; plus a handful of masculine vests, some floaty, Stevie Nicks–type dresses (a few done in Zandra Rhodes–like prints), and a palette of muted, sanded-down, tea-stained colors. The collection included some of the fine-gauge cropped knits that are emerging as a seasonal essential, and touched on the current feeling for stripes and for lightened-up masculine dressing, featured in a pale blue-and-white seersucker three-piece suit with cropped pants. It was less successful in catching on to another key virtue of modern fashion: the art of the edit. Brevity is the soul of any strong statement, and this one was weakened by too much repetition.</p></div>"
77,spring,2004,s2004,michael-kors-collection,"Call it destination dressing. For his spring collection, Michael Kors created a wardrobe with a specific locale in mind: the tiny Mediterranean island of Capri, where pleasure-seekers spend their days yacht-hopping in the harbor and their nights table-hopping at the cafés.</p><p>The designer excels at giving classic cuts a sexy edge and a sly spin of luxe, and this season’s jet-set theme gave him carte blanche to pile it on. He added bright gold zippers and contrast stitching to slim jeans; cut miniskirts and motorcycle jackets out of supple suede; and wrapped a prizefighter-size gold belt around a suede romper. Typical Kors hallmarks included leather luggage straps in place of ties on a halter dress, nautical references, and his signature mix of high and low fabrics (silk and canvas, for example). He used white, black, and khaki as a backdrop to set off colors—like vivid orange, yellow, cobalt, and green—which were far more intense than the muted tones generally in favor this season.</p><p>For a major designer, Kors didn’t offer much in the way of full-out evening glamour, just a few simple gowns and one beaded dress as blue as the Mediterranean. But his color-blocked cashmeres, swingy silk jersey skirts, crisp organdy shirts, and dresses in blue-and-white awning stripes will certainly make his customer feel ready for Capri—even if she’s stuck in midtown.</p></div>"
78,spring,2004,s2004,miguel-adrover,"Miguel Adrover, one-time messiah and part-time pariah of the New York fashion world, returned to the tents with a collection entitled “thesurrealrealworld.” Divided into nine sections, the show opened with a face- and body-painted model who walked down a darkened runway to the sound of cicadas and the artificial lightning of a corps of paparazzi. From there, Adrover took his audience on a continent-hopping jaunt, finally returning to his aesthetic roots: tailored prep-school looks and uniforms, daring feats of drapery, and ingenious trompe l’oeil constructions.</p><p>Some of the show’s kookier experiments included a UPS man’s exit onto the runway (thank you, sponsor), a model whose cape was actually a banner calling for “world peace, please,” and a man who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders (via a Tom Sawyer stick from which hung a cloth globe). Mixed in among these, though, were some moments of genuine euphoria. Adrover used shredded cloth and ribbons of lining tape to make beautiful, African-inspired, plume-like capes and jackets and skirts. There were draped, dress-like jumpsuits; dresses whose back panels tied in front, apron-style; and lots of classic American prep--impeccably tailored suits, coats, and elbow-patched blazers, paired with oxford shirts and khakis and wonderful knits.</p><p>Adrover himself took to the runway in what looked like a top, a vest, and two coats, but was in fact all one piece (there was also a female version). The most memorable exit—perfectly illustrating both the designer’s extreme lyricism and his technical expertise—was a dress that was also a ship: long, hand-painted with masts, and with a white sail/train rigged to the back.</p></div>"
79,spring,2004,s2004,missoni,"With their slinky, striped knits, knotted-string halternecks, frizzed-out hairdos, and wooden platform sandals, the girls at Missoni might have been having a flashback to the 1970's. And why not? That was the decade when Tai and Rosita Missoni first made big news, and this show was an emotional celebration of their multicolored fifty-year run as one of Italy’s most-loved family businesses.</p><p>The Missonis’ daughter, Angela, has carried the company’s obsession with zigzags, chevrons, and stripes to a new high. Her delicately playful pop animal prints, swirly art nouveau–derived patterns, and flaring vertical lines—all controlled by a slim, body-conscious silhouette—make for an amazing spectrum of separates, dresses, and utterly desirable cutout swimsuits and beach cover-ups.</p><p>Angela’s collection was followed by a runway retrospective of her parents’ archives, a parade that illustrated the range of creativity and imagination that propelled Missoni to become a cult label of the rich hippie/jet-set era. It was like watching a knitted footnote to the history of fashion, weaving its way through space age to bohemian eclectic to Studio 54, offering kaleidoscopes of color in tapestries, patchworks, quilts, butterfly wings, and every variation of stripe imaginable. More extraordinary still, most of it looked absolutely wearable now. Perhaps that’s an observation on how all-inclusive trends have become; it also shows just how rich and inspiring an inheritance Angela Missoni has to play with.</p></div>"
80,spring,2004,s2004,miu-miu,"Sometimes the most inspirational fashion doesn’t come as an in-your-face design statement, but as a suggestion—like spotting a girl on the street who really knows how to put herself together. Watching Miu Miu’s collection for spring was just like that: a gentle mix of vintage and new, casual and decorative, anchored with the perfect accessories.</p><p>Miuccia Prada knows, for instance, exactly how to make one of those vibrant pink sixties cocktail shifts—the sort that come encrusted with jewels at the neck—wearable by throwing on a plain sage-green cardigan, pulling it in with a leather belt, and accessorizing with a pair of cute but grounding suede pumps. Voila, easy.</p><p>That kind of eclectic, offhand charm pervaded the entire collection from the little rumpled linen jackets and coats, to the denim shirtdresses and high-waisted pedal pushers, to the fifties dressmaker–style evening frocks. Better still, it was a show of irresistible accessories. In the hair, feathery fifties headbands. On the feet, printed plush-velvet high pumps or flat moccasins. In the hand, soft leather bags with bamboo handles or brilliant orange versions encrusted with beads. It all amounted to an idealized inventory of the lucky finds millions of girls spend their Saturdays seeking out at flea markets. Next season, no need to waste time: It’s all there, ready and waiting at that clever Miuccia’s stall.</p></div>"
81,spring,2004,s2004,moschino,"Schoolgirlish jokes are to Moschino what knits are to Missoni or psychedelic prints to Pucci: the core of its brand identity. This season the goofing around started with a rusty brown coat masquerading as a door—complete with panels, brass knocker, and house number—worn open over a bikini, with fluorescent over-the-knee stockings and satin wedges. From there the collection played a kind of sophomoric peekaboo with surrealism, referencing Dali (lip prints on silk dresses), Elsa Schiaparelli, and Christian Berard (pink georgette scarf-printed gowns).</p><p>For those who still didn’t get it, cotton underwear graffiti’d with slogans like ""too haute to handle"" (bada-boom) signaled to the general theme of messing about with the icons of Parisian couture. Chanel-inspired jackets had fringes clanking with plastic beads in hard-candy colors; fifties–style strapless tulle evening gowns were encrusted with safety pins or enamel badges to mimic embroidery. Some of the gags were misjudged, like a reprise of punk (not <em>that</em> old chestnut again!) and the use of far too much black to be funny. But there were plenty of pieces that toyed with summer’s trends in a way that won’t make Moschino shoppers feel they’re buying into a complete joke.</p></div>"
82,spring,2004,s2004,narciso-rodriguez,"As she watched the parade of models sway down the runway in Narciso Rodriguez’s sexy spring show, Julianna Margulies turned more than once to her front-row neighbor Stephanie Seymour and rolled her eyes in delirious delight. She wasn’t the only one. Inspired by Brazil, and especially the wild abandon of Carnival, Narciso Rodriguez sent out a collection that married his meticulously cool elegance to a steamy new sensuality.</p><p>What’s become his signature look—skintight dresses, molded to every curve—was still the heart of the proceedings. But this season, Rodriguez warmed it up with earthy, textured fabrics like linen, washed silk, and crisp white cotton. He inserted sheer panels of tulle or simply cut out bits of the bodice for a glimpse of skin, and made a lattice of lingerie straps across the back. Slim pants were worn with trapeze jackets or tops whose swingy peplums perfectly emphasized the model’s own curves. True to form, the designer sent out a wealth of lovely evening gowns, made from fluttering parachute silk (a welcome change from the season’s ubiquitous chiffon) in black, violet, rose, white, and nude, gently detailed with pintucks, tulle, or a bit of beading.</p><p>There may not have been any huge departure from the look he’s made so clearly his own, but Rodriguez designs according to his convictions, not the prevailing trends. Combined with his formidable talent, that relentless focus will keep his faithful customers very happy this spring.</p></div>"
83,spring,2004,s2004,nina-ricci,"""Lightness, color, femininity,"" said Lars Nilsson, summing up a sweet debut collection for Nina Ricci that focused on wispy, weightless daywear. But wasn't Nina Ricci the sophisticated tailor of her day? Didn't she dress ladies of a certain age in classic suits? Nilsson, who proved that he could cut a mean jacket and pants during his tenure at Bill Blass, abandoned tailoring altogether for his summer statement, save a single black wool gabardine jacket worn with knitted shorts. ""I was after something more sensual,"" he explained.</p><p>Hence all the super-delicate lingerie slips and bra tops with spider-web lace or tulle inserts that came with Bermuda shorts, flippy skirts, and silk blousons. The colors—lemon, tangerine, almond, mint—were delicious, especially when they sparkled with Lurex thread or were embroidered with transparent beads. And the dresses, from chiffon confections sprinkled with bows to slender jersey tanks, were perfectly in tune with this season's passion for all things pretty.</p><p>The purposeful femininity was no doubt intended to stamp the Nina Ricci brand with a strong, and much needed, sense of identity. But the collection overall was too floaty, and more tailoring might have anchored it better. We’ll just have to wait until fall to see how Mr. Nilsson cuts his trousers.</p></div>"
84,spring,2004,s2004,oscar-de-la-renta,"It’s virtually impossible not to get swept up in Oscar de la Renta’s confident vision of the luxurious life. The designer played to all of his strengths for spring, showing more of the pretty dresses, chic suits, and slim coats that have made him a touchstone of relaxed, modern elegance.</p><p>Judging from the cuts and colors of this collection, de la Renta has Palm Beach on his mind. He opened with a series of brightly colored dresses and skirts, some cut in a swingy, ballooning silhouette, others slim and paired with silk sweaters. The designer knows how to keep things young—by roughing up the edges of a turquoise silk skirt or tossing a boxy yellow alligator jacket over a slim white skirt—as well as how to dress those whose daily routine includes cocktails on the yacht (answer: a group of simple black dresses, each more Hepburn-perfect than the last, or a spangly pink pencil skirt worn with a cashmere top to fend off ocean breezes).</p><p>Turning up the volume for evening, de la Renta progressed from a long, cool pour of pink charmeuse, to a giddy yellow satin strapless dress covered in nosegays of silk flowers, to embroidered and embellished showstoppers guaranteed to make it a memorable night—red carpet or not.</p></div>"
85,spring,2004,s2004,paul-smith,"There’s still a boyish quality to Paul Smith, even though he’s a “Sir” now—not to mention the most financially successful Brit designer ever, and something of a national treasure to boot. Smith’s ability to play games with old English classics—deflating pomposity with color and wit, while never looking like he’s trying too hard—is what’s made him a worldwide hit in menswear, and guess what? That’s exactly how it works best for girls, too.</p><p>In a season when crisp shirts and V-neck sweaters are news again, Smith is in his element, having fun with stripes and ties, and turning school uniform-style fine-gauge knits into skimpy dresses. Cut close to the body, his suits, with their bracelet-length sleeves and their skirts caught up in a ruched detail in the back, are just naughty enough to avoid any teacher’s-pet primness. The designer also worked his blue-and-white shirting stripes into little camisole-top cotton dresses, and made printed silk scarves—that other bastion of ladylike dressing—into bright camisoles and strappy shifts. It added up to a happy, easy-to-shop collection that worked best when Sir Paul seemed to be designing off the cuff.</p></div>"
86,spring,2004,s2004,peter-som,"Peter Som will probably never have an avant-garde moment, and that’s a very good thing. His vision of cheerful, pretty sportswear has been picking up both momentum and fans over the last few seasons, and this latest collection will surely add a few more members to the club.</p><p>For Spring, Som connected fall’s mod mood to the light-and-lacy trend that’s been dominating the runways. Inspired by the wide-eyed optimism (not to mention the daring fashion movements) of the early sixties, he shortened hemlines, cropped sleeves, and raised waistlines, with happy results. Som combined airy, pale blues and pinks with white, gray, and green, and mixed up textures—chiffon, lace, satin, washed cotton, and a glittery blue-and-silver cloqué—to keep things interesting. Trailing satin ribbons and squashed silk flowers upped the femininity quotient even further.</p><p>The past may have provided the inspiration, but Som’s mind is very much on the present; his trim canvas jackets, slim cropped trousers, and skin-baring minis are clearly aimed at the toned twenty-first-century girl. Fortunately, this designer knows where to draw the line: The sweetly sexy guipure lace babydoll that closed the show balanced then and now in one seriously charming package.</p></div>"
87,spring,2004,s2004,pierrot,"In spring, wrote Tennyson, a young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love. In the case of quirky knitwear designer Pierrot, that sometimes means more of a triple-X affair than a tender, courtly romance.</p><p>Pierrot presented his collection on the soundstage of <em>The Maury Povich Show</em>, where he’d built a flimsy movie set, and had his models pretend to be making a porn flick, complete with roving film crew and cheesy props. It didn’t have all that much to do with the clothes, but there was a good-natured, low-budget charm to the performance. And with the exception of some disturbingly enthusiastic cameo appearances by Mimi Rogers (who, incidentally, looked pretty good in Pierrot’s clingy knits), it was all pretty G-rated.</p><p>As was the collection. Flippy skirts in delicate pink or white crochet, colorful little sweaters with humorously suggestive flower motifs, and pretty sweater dresses all make perfect springtime fare. Those who see knitwear as largely a winter category should take a closer look at this designer’s handiwork, with some caveats:The black knit chaps and the tops depicting very explicit sexual acts should probably go right back to wardrobe.</p></div>"
88,spring,2004,s2004,prada,"Over almost a decade of ground-breaking experimentalism, Miuccia Prada has explored everything from irony to deliberate ugliness to intellectual subversion. She’s been there, done that, and has the souvenirs to prove it. For Spring 2004, the designer turned her attention to the stiffest fashion challenge of the day: how to make feminine, happily nostalgic clothes without rehashing the clichés of vintage?</p><p>“It was about tourism and craftsmanship, many things,” she said of a show that revisited the optimistic fifties to bring back a full set of densely packed suitcases. Out tumbled every possible variation on the classic touring wardrobe: circle skirts printed with illustrated Mediterranean scenes, shirtwaists and Capri pants, sundresses and bathing suits, button-through skirts and lovely evening frocks, silk madras bras and little tulle full-skirted dance dresses.</p><p>What set the collection apart were the subtle twists, like the way Prada will gently mess up fabric with dip-dye and tie-dye, turn seams inside out, or leave edges raw. Something in the proportion of her neat little tops, belted slightly above the waist, to the fullness and length of her skirts, to the height of her T-strap shoes or pumps, inexplicably excuses the silhouette from the frumpiness of the literal fifties line. Meanwhile, students of Pradaology will note that her sight-seeing tour also revisits some favorite landmarks of her own career: the silk pleated goddess dresses, fur tippets, and grosgrain ribbons tied as belts, all of seasons past. Just another layer of complexity in a beautiful collection that will have women all over the world clamoring, once again, to go where Miuccia leads.</p></div>"
89,spring,2004,s2004,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi, one of several double-headed design labels in London, have good antennae; their Preen collection always manages to tune into the prevailing trends without losing its streetwear-inspired authenticity. For spring, the duo reconfigured used leather bomber jackets and cotton T-shirt materials into a body-conscious, lingerie-influenced collection that retained a gritty urban edge.</p><p>Preen worked puffy, asymmetric pieces of second-hand leather into jackets, jumpsuits, and outsize shoulderbags, and embellished with stretch beige foundation garments, garter belts, and falling-down bra straps. Vestiges of former garments, like the ribbed cotton welts of eighties blousons, or a trompe-l’oeil leather stocking-top, added an extra element of intrigue to the mix. Thornton and Bregazzi said they had been inspired by “glam-rock, David Bowie, and comic-strip superheroes,” and the resulting look—though it marches alongside that of Helmut Lang and Rick Owens—has a distinctive swagger all its own.</p></div>"
90,spring,2004,s2004,proenza-schouler,"In the great empty hull of the North Pavilion of New York’s Javits Center, Proenza Schouler floated out a sublime collection for Spring 2004. Changing course from fall's more structured shapes, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez loosened things up, describing their new silhouette as ""long and lean on top and full at the bottom, but all with a weightlessness and airiness."" To that end, silk charmeuse voile and gauze were worked up into flowing flapper dresses and breezy skirts paired with scoop-necked boyfriend sweaters worn down low over the hips. The twenties were also referenced with ropes of H. Stern pearls and black-and-white tweed jackets which nodded to Chanel.</p><p>To a soundtrack (by Brooklyn art/design collective Lansing-Dreiden) that evoked an appropriately nautical ebb and flow, summer classics bobbed up consistently throughout the collection. Canvas and seersucker were made up into sleek pants and highly covetous shrunken jackets. Eye-catching bathing suits and tank tops, in electric blue and mint, reprised the form-defining lines of the bustiers in the duo’s fall collection but with a bright, sporty twist. And for rainy days, there was a patent-leather, sequined raincoat so yellow as to challenge the sun to come out. Other highlights included a short black patent jacket, prepster staples like button-downs and shorts enlivened with a custom print, and a suede jacket in Nantucket red.</p><p>Makeup director Tom Pecheux described his brief for the show as ""sporty but fragile,"" which could well be applied to the entire collection—establishing Proenza Schouler firmly at the helm of a stylish vessel on a strong course.</p></div>"
91,spring,2004,s2004,rachel-comey,"Womenswear has been creeping gradually into Rachel Comey’s growing men’s line, finally reaching a critical mass for Spring 2004. In keeping with her now-dual focus, Comey (who also designs costumes for New York’s punk cabaret Gogol Bordello) opted for a straightforward runway show instead of her usual theatrical installation. Held in the outside promenade of New York’s Flatotel, it still had the dramatic flair that Comey’s enthusiastic young following has come to expect.</p><p>The first women’s exit was a little black jersey dress, constructed in layers, with crisscross ties and finished at the end with silver caps. Cut close on top, it was loose and forgiving at the bottom. Another black dress of tiered, crinkled chiffon, with a pencil-sketch print done for Comey by Clay Weiner, exemplified the “decorative but not too flashy” feeling she was aiming for. Most of the pieces she showed were designed, Comey said, as being “airy, light, and daytime,” which translated into an abundance of smart separates: tank tops worn under printed chiffon tops; a pencil skirt worn with a swingy, sharp-shouldered jacket; reversible blousons and shorts; and a lilac jacket with rip-stop nylon detailing borrowed from her sports-themed menswear. The overall mood was pure summer, and the collection full of confident, easy clothes for cool customers with discerning eyes.</p></div>"
92,spring,2004,s2004,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren sets out to beautify his customer’s life without complicating it, and that philosophy has served him well; his far-reaching lifestyle empire now brings in about $2.4 billion a year. With his confident, colorful Spring collection, Lauren once again demonstrated his time-honored skill at balancing classic sportswear with a sense of luxury.</p><p>He started with a group of cream and black pieces inspired by the athletic life. There were tennis-flavored dresses, one in white silk with a polo collar and a swingy pleated skirt, another inspired by the classic cable-knit sweater with a plunging V-neckline; a pinstriped baseball jacket worn with a matching pencil skirt; a sequined varsity cardigan; and a sexy white silk gown with a silver mesh racer back that suggested fencing gear. Lauren cuts a great jacket, and there were plenty of terrific options in black silk stretch or white cotton, with nipped waists and a bit of flare over the hips to emphasize the female form.</p><p>For the second half, Lauren exploded into color, assembling tropical hues of violet, lime green, yellow, pink, and fuchsia and sending out classic man-tailored pantsuits worn with vivid contrasting cashmere sweaters and georgette shirts. The designer ended with a handful of utterly simple, perfectly cut liquid charmeuse gowns, in bird-of-paradise colors guaranteed to intoxicate.</p></div>"
93,spring,2004,s2004,rick-owens,"Funny how out-of-town designers get whipped into shape once they reach Paris. Rick Owens—he of the dark, Goth, crinkled layers—has discovered a new, lightened-up way of expressing his aesthetic now that he’s immersed himself in this city’s competitive fashion culture.</p><p>Owens cited Frenchmen Rene Gruau and Jean-Paul Goude as the two main influences on his Spring collection. And, though it was hard to trace his new body-consciousness and use of color to either 1950’s fashion graphics or 1980’s photographic manipulation, there is a detectable change going on here. In place of unrelentingly dark floor-dragging shapes, there were short skirts with floating asymmetric trails and stretch-gauze tops wrapping the breast and torso. Even the designer’s familiar shades of gray were interrupted by surprising washes of pink, peach, coral, paprika, pistachio, and aqua.</p><p>Not that Owens has abandoned the slouchy, raw-edged attitude—or the incredible washed leathers—so adored by his huge band of followers. It’s just that now he’s added hacked-off versions of 1930’s charmeuse skirts and ultra-refined whitewashed leather jackets, twisted into a tie and fastening at the neck, into his repertoire—not to mention high heels, slicked-back hair, and pink lipstick. Though he still needs to shape all that into a more concise runway statement, Owens is clearly taking this collection in the right direction.</p></div>"
94,spring,2004,s2004,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli opened his latest extravaganza with giant screen projections featuring fast-paced stills and video clips of Cher, specifically her wild seventies moments. The throbbing momentum of movie and soundtrack was so dramatic that it came as a crashing anticlimax when the diva herself—Cavalli’s muse of this and many another season—did not appear on the mirrored runway. And for all his devil-may-care bravura Cavalli seemed to find the arch, razzle-dazzle couture of Bob Mackie, who created Cher's most eye-popping looks, equally elusive.</p><p>Nonetheless, prints, brilliant color, and cabaret sparkle are all big news this season and Cavalli had them aplenty; his heady mix even included raunchy rodeo queens in tiny python jackets with rhinestone-beaded yokes or finely-chiseled leather chaps. Skin-tight cowgirl shirts and hourglass dresses featured prints of swirling pheasant and guinea fowl feathers—often embellished with the real thing—or of frenzied kaleidoscope effects that evoked Pompeian tiled courtyards. Cavalli also tapped a softer side of seventies fashion with sexy, layered, drifting chiffon print dresses that recalled Swinging London designer Ossie Clark (who's currently being celebrated in an influential exhibit at London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum).</p><p>A fussier side of evening was revealed in deftly draped gowns with elaborately structured bodices that had the come-hither appeal of saloon gals in a fifties spaghetti western. Subtlety has never been Cavalli's forte—how about a spotted cat jacket with diamond cutouts for an airy summer effect?—and somehow his floor-length pieces, slashed and bared as they are, reveal more than most designers’ swimsuits. Overall, his flamboyant results—an ivory goddess gown seemingly held together with threads of crystal, or midriff-baring costumes with skirts of ostrich pompons—ended up looking more Vegas showgirl than Cher.</p></div>"
95,spring,2004,s2004,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens is blessed with a rare romanticism, shot through with an almost invisible thread of something darker. For Rochas, he gathers up the lace, taffeta bows, silver lamé, delicate pink silks, and roses of old-world couture, and re-presents them as a modern bouquet—an offering to girls who have never seen prettiness through the eyes of one of their own generation. “I didn’t want to do a sexy siren,” he said. “Not trendy, not street, but something like a goddess from another world.”</p><p>That vision translated first into black lace, covering silver-gray suits with bolero jackets over short, slightly flared high-waisted skirts. Then corsetry came into play, exposed in swooping cutaway necklines beneath suits or structured into strapless dresses. All the while, he worked with tiny decorative edgings and frills, introducing oval lace insets (he calls them “cocoons”) that finally took over as the pattern dominating a few grand evening gowns.</p><p>Although Theyskens respects beauty and rejects the shock tactics, irony, and edginess of a previous generation, there’s something febrile in his imagination, too. The structure of his clothes was inspired, he said, by the work of Aloise Corbaz, a schizophrenic 1920’s outsider artist who painted naïvely magical figures of women in breast-exposing dresses. That strange undercurrent didn’t prevent him from sending out a couple of voluminous tulle wonders that will walk beautifully on any red carpet. But it adds to the sense that this young designer is capable of skewing the apparently conventional in a fascinatingly different way.</p></div>"
96,spring,2004,s2004,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret, a Frenchman who has become something of a star in the London fashion world, brought his collection to New York for the first time this season. He came to the attention of the press over three years ago when he began to show what has now become his signature—seamless draped dresses held together with just a pin.</p><p>For Spring, Mouret reprised the themes of his Fall 2003 collection, which blended mod-style tailoring with <em>Barbarella</em>-inspired accents. Exploring the clash of hard and soft, he translated Fall's patent-leather harnesses into knit bathing suits—a new category for the designer—and showed a softly draped gown with an unexpected breastplate embellished with pieces of antique mirror. There were beautiful coats, like the strong white structured one that opened the show and the bathrobe-style piece in white satin, and several marvelous draped and layered tanks—some produced via extraordinary feats of suspension, others featuring beautiful embroidery. Dresses combined Grecian drape with flapper flow and came out short and sexy or with long, languorous, mermaid-like trains.</p><p>Less successful were Mouret’s attempts at raunch—zippered, leather proto-punk/biker vests and jackets—and gimmicks like Noel Stewart's Mickey Mouse hats, which detracted from the focus of the collection. Overall, however, the show lived up to its title: ""Smiling in the Bright Lights.""</p></div>"
97,spring,2004,s2004,saint-laurent,"“It was woman as dandy,” declared Tom Ford of the sinuous twenties and thirties feel he melded into satins and chiffons for YSL’s Spring collection. The designer narrowed and lengthened Saint Laurent’s original boxy, hard-edged lines, opening with louchely draped powder-blue satin suits. The jackets closed with wide hip fastenings over a new-shaped pant that was cut loose to the knee, then caught tight with rows of tiny covered buttons.</p><p>Ford’s skew on House retro synthesized masculine and feminine elements: a low-belted, gold-buttoned trench was paired with rib-cuffed jog pants, while petaled jersey skirts flew out from under skintight black leather jackets. Reruns of the classic smokings included tuxes, white vests, and mannish dressing gowns, cut floppy and liable to fall open at the breast at any moment. Together with the major frizzed hairdos and sexy high-heeled spectator shoes in leather and canvas, it added up to a new silhouette for the tall, sexually-in-control woman Ford envisions as the spirit of modern YSL.</p><p>She’s just as powerful-looking in a dress, of course. Karen Elson (who, with her alabaster complexion and ginger hair, is making a comeback as the perfect pre-war muse this season) symbolized that strength, striding out in palest pink bias-cut jersey, pieced in a twenties diamond-pattern at the hip and with handkerchief points flying from shoulder and hem. There followed a line of equally individual gowns in satin and chiffon, worked with curving scalloped layers and plissé skirts and held up by the finest shoulder straps.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gvxo9q""></div></div><p>The visions of pared-down, re-imagined Deco glamour kept coming. There were more sober options in black, with strands of jet beading moving over dark georgette, but they were finally upstaged by a sensational misty blue chiffon gown, delicately suspended from strings of crystal and swinging sparkling fringe, and a white dress smothered in gold coins with delicate pleats fanning out in the skirt. The details in this deluge of gorgeousness were equally unmissable: the new horn-handled pony-skin bags, and the enticingly luxe diamond jewelry. That turned out to come from Boucheron, not YSL—but since they are sister companies in the Gucci Group, it made for a clever piece of borrowing.</p></div>"
98,spring,2004,s2004,sebastian-pons,"Sometimes you <em>can</em> go home again. Sebastian Pons was born in Majorca, graduated from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, spent some time working with Alexander McQueen, and then moved to New York to join Miguel Adrover’s design team. Yet it was only after Pons returned to his native island that he debuted his first collection here, following an intensive period of research about the early history of fashion. If your idea of early means vintage, think again; his collection, called Itaca, was a sartorial excursion through the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, and Southeast Asia, with some contemporary Spanish spice sprinkled throughout.</p><p>Opening in ancient mode, Pons showed a one-shouldered toga in a natural tint, followed closely by another in Roman purple. He used linen, a fabric with an appropriately venerable past, for a series of marvelous dresses: one with simple decorative stitching, like a converted table cloth; another embroidered in blue; yet another painted by hand with a pomegranate motif. Some of the most chic pieces in the collection were the suits—a kind of <em>campesino</em> take on Chanel, with drop-waisted skirts and embroidered cardigan jackets that laced up the front and at the wrist. The concept was repeated to more bohemian effect with rustic Ikat prints and added fringes.</p><p>As the show progressed the clothes became more decorative, moving through knits in Arabian-inspired patterns and hues to end in a souk-like riot of color: pink and green chiffons stitched with semi-precious stones; a chemise entirely embroidered in colored threads and pieces of mirror; and simple dresses with floral prints and pretty ribbon trims. Overall, Pons achieved an impressive balance between the classic and the decorative, launching his fashion caravan on what looks set to be a thrilling journey.</p></div>"
99,spring,2004,s2004,sonia-rykiel,"How <em>does</em> she do it? Sonia Rykiel's collection managed to be both a recap of her greatest hits and yet still look fresh and in sync with everything currently hip in fashion. From her trademark skinny rib sweaters in multicolored bands worn with fashionably short microshorts to her signature floaty dresses (this season dappled with poppies, stars, and pansies), Rykiel was right on target. Ditto her quintessential black tailoring—but then long, lean, and languid never really goes out of fashion.</p><p>What's most extraordinary about this defiantly young-spirited woman (now in her 70s) is her passion for sexy clothes that never dip into vulgar. That's true even for pieces like the mesh black body stockings decorated with Rykiel's beloved crystal and presented so nonchalantly (one with a built-in G-string!); they looked like something a trapeze artist at a racy Parisian circus might wear.</p><p>Given Rykiel's frank enjoyment of the sensual, it seemed only fitting that she'd share it with her audience. For the finale, she sent out a troop of handsome men to spritz the air with her new scent, Rykiel Woman—and then let her bra-clad models smooch and canoodle with the boys. Now here's a woman who has perfected the twin arts of nice and naughty.</p></div>"
100,spring,2004,s2004,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki is a Greek designer who’s growing into the idea of letting her classical roots show. For spring, she used goddess-y draping and Fortunyesque pleating in tiny, sexy dresses and tops crafted to clasp around a perfect body. Working with a lightened-up palette of shell pink, pale terra cotta, and muted aqua, and an occasional sparkling underlay of Swarovski crystal, she also cast off her customary dark, new-wave influences—for the time being, anyway.</p><p>Kokosalaki has always had a knack for adapting elements of her cultural background to suit the mood of the season. When fashion was in a folksy moment, she made her reputation with Empire dresses that had a Cretan peasant feel. Now that she’s been selected to design the costumes for the Athens Olympics, it should hardly be surprising that she’s celebrating the beauty of classical Greek sculpture—in a form that a modern girl might wear clubbing. Was it a long, hot summer working in the Olympics office that also influenced Kokosalaki to cut her daywear down to a few pairs of shorts and the odd cropped leather shirt? If so, that’s a bit of a shame. The dresses will look fabulous in photos, but a little more in the way of daily clothing for mere mortals wouldn’t have gone amiss.</p></div>"
101,spring,2004,s2004,stella-mccartney,"Confidence, confidence, confidence! What a treat it was to see Stella McCartney in self-assured mode, her finger firmly on fashion's current pulse.</p><p>Gone were the tricky corsetry, the bland biscuit shades, the reworked vintage pieces of previous collections. Instead, McCartney sent out strong color—aqua, spearmint, jade, lemon, pink—and banished references to iconic designers’ past hits, relying on her own keen sense of what makes clothes graceful and cool. For the former, there were the dresses suspended by superfine straps, and filmy skirts of petal-like chiffon layers, all artfully blown by wind machines as the models struck their poses. Hip was defined by a crème de menthe silk blouson, or the sharp, sexy pants that came with milky-colored chiffon tops hung from latex straps. McCartney licked the ballet trend currently pirouetting its way through Paris, with second-skin jerseys and knitted rib warmers over floaty minis. The accessories looked great too: flesh-toned, transparent-strapped shoes and metal-trimmed bags embellished with enamel stones. Those, and the delicate eveningwear—embroidered and smocked with gold thread—will have her fans in raptures next spring.</p><p>Back to the confidence issue. Could it be her recent marriage to Alasdhair Willis that has finally anchored McCartney’s self-reliance? Whatever the reason, the Stella McCartney woman is no longer trying too hard. She's all grown up, and looks much better for it.</p></div>"
102,spring,2004,s2004,stephen-burrows,"Welcome to Stephen Burrows’ World—again. One of the preeminent American designers of the seventies, Burrows is beloved by the cognoscenti, but little known by the public, despite having won three Coty Awards and been one of only five American designers to represent the U.S. at the legendary 1973 fashion exposition in the Palace of Versailles. Last year, Henri Bendel, where Burrows had a hugely successful boutique back in his day, relaunched the designer with a brand-new, in-store atelier. For his Spring 2003 show, his first of the twenty-first century, he invited “the Misses” (his term for seventies supermodels like Alva Chinn, Pat Cleveland, and Karen Bjornson) to walk for him, but made no other concessions to the past. ""I want to be to be as modern as I can,” said the designer, and sent out a resolutely up-to-the minute collection to prove it.</p><p>Burrows prefers clingy, flowing materials like silk and jersey, and worked these into deceptively simple column dresses with wonderful variants on the halter top. Some incorporated ribbons, others were cut high on the leg, still others pulled off virtuoso feats of engineering, but all gave an impression of grace and fluidity. Daytime looks included a bright jersey dress with a track suit-like jacket and a black ensemble with red top stitching (a reference to the designer's original, signature, red-stitched lettuce hems). Long a champion of bold colors, Burrows built this collection around vibrant hues—citrus yellows, ocean blues, and orchid reds—inspired by ""tropical fruits and the lushness of an island rainforest.""</p></div>"
103,spring,2004,s2004,temperley-london,"Alice Temperley is London’s answer to Zac Posen, in female form: an out-of-nowhere designer who has already gathered an adoring posse of young socialites, fashion eds, and models who whip around town, flipping their pastel-hued, scallop-edged hems and passing on her name with delighted sighs.</p><p>Starting from her Notting Hill studio, Alice has grown and grown, almost entirely by word of mouth, to the point where she’s recently been able to open a “private dressing showroom” in a Soho loft. She makes dresses for urban nymphets who like liberal sprinklings of ruffles and fairy-dust sparkles in their midsummer night’s party-hopping wardrobes. Come spring, they’ll be calling Alice for an appointment to riffle through a vaguely thirties-cum-fifties collection that she describes as having been inspired by a James Thurber story about a princess who asked for the moon. Decisions, decisions! Will it be a rose-pink chiffon dress with ivory, crystal-beaded French lace at the shoulders and a ribbon tied in a bow at the waist? An innocent white eyelet gown with an aqua lining peeping through? Or that mouth-watering, full-length lingerie dress in palest mango sorbet chiffon with a cutout lace bodice? Whichever they choose, this is a collection that has no pretensions about altering the path of fashion. Temperley’s clothes will never cut it with London’s serious avant-garde, but rather will waft along effortlessly on the young lady-like breeze that’s blowing through spring—and manage it with a lot of charm.</p></div>"
104,spring,2004,s2004,tim-van-steenbergen,"Tap, tap, tap went the tips of their toes, as the Antwerp Royal Ballet School ballerinas modeling Tim Van Steenbergen’s collection pranced down the runway <em>en pointe</em>—an apt choice for his collection of balletic workwear.</p><p>Van Steenbergen is part of the new generation of Antwerp designers currently sweeping Paris. Coming from fashion’s creative petri dish, it’s to be expected that his clothes would be anything but literal; in other words, <em>Swan Lake</em> it was not. There were dance references aplenty: asymmetric hems cut from fluid layers, workout trousers with elastic cuffs, shrunken wrap tops, V-neck tanks with runs in them, and knitted leggings. But there were also bright green belted trenchcoats, voluminous bubble-shaped skirts gathered with rope at the hem, and dainty dresses embroidered with satin flowers and trailing ribbons.</p><p>And what on earth was that jacket with puffed wrists, embellished with great gobs of crystal and sequins, and dripping with beads? “I wanted to mix costumes that a dancer might wear onstage with her workout gear,” explained the 25-year-old van Steenbergen, confiding that he spent many an evening decorating said jacket on his sofa in front of the television. The costume element also explained a great white skirt layered over thick lace petticoats, like something worn by an antique porcelain doll. Romantic, yet original; it will be interesting to see where this young designer’s imagination heads next.</p></div>"
105,spring,2004,s2004,tommy-hilfiger,"“It’s about color,” Tommy Hilfiger said a few days before his Spring 2004 show. “Color and fun.” He might have added “ease,” too, because there wasn’t a stiff fabric or a tricky cut in his cheerful, carefree collection.</p><p>The show did have a few anxious moments: There was a rock star–worthy crush at the door due to the presence of Pharrell Williams, who performed the runway music. But once the beat kicked in and the clothes streamed out, the tension evaporated. Who could be stressed by a pair of light-as-air drawstring pants worn with a tummy-grazing silk pique tee, or a clean white taffeta dress with brisk orange grosgrain ribbon? Hilfiger has made his name—and considerable fortune—by dusting off preppy classics, and he repeated the trick tonight via hot hues like apple green, neon pink, orange, and blue, all played off white basics. He loosened up the silhouette, too, with full-leg jeans, billowy sheer hoodies, and silky pleated skirts.</p><p>While most of the styles were daytime-specific, the designer didn’t completely neglect the nightlife. A fluttery pink gown, or a hot-pink chiffon dress, its bodice wrapped in multicolored ribbon, kept the mood upbeat right to the end.</p></div>"
106,spring,2004,s2004,tuleh,"Bryan Bradley’s first runway show as the sole name behind Tuleh (he and partner Josh Patner split earlier this year) was brief—only 27 looks. But it was a perfect demonstration of the skills that make him the go-to designer in the socialite stratosphere.</p><p>Bradley sent out lovely chiffon dresses in garden-party colors like lime, lilac, rose, and lemon yellow, and incorporated witty tailoring touches like extended cuffs and geometric topstitching on a trench coat. This designer has an unusually sure hand with colors and prints: He paired a pink silk polka-dot dress with a pink-and-white silk brocade coat; put silver lace over a pink gown; and paired a khaki trench with an aqua lace dress. It wasn’t all about chiffon, either. Bradley worked in some nifty new fabrics, like a khaki tweed shot through with silver thread for a boxy little jacket, and a black silk faille with white pindots for a mod coat.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Bradley knows the answer to a very important question: Just how much sexiness do his high-profile customers want? Answer: more than a hint, but less than a salvo. He strikes just the right balance via fluttering ruffles (fashion’s way of saying “yoo-hoo!”) in all the right places; lingerie details like seams picked out in attention-getting black leather; and a figure-friendly cut that flatters the female form, but never makes unreasonable demands. Just like the ideal man.</p></div>"
107,spring,2004,s2004,undercover,"Jun Takahashi showed his collection on pairs of identical twins: How sweet! Each sister act came out with matching hairdos and wearing different versions of the same outfit—one playing it straight, the other a visual meltdown of the look, like a reflection in a fairground mirror. Takahashi worked his idea across a range of fashion standards, like sailor tees and khakis, white shirts and black pants, French trenches with Kelly bags, and American blue jeans and baseball shirts.</p><p>Shows like these are what fashion’s cool-seekers come to Paris to see: ideas that make you smile, but also engage the brain. For all its surface innocence and playfulness, the Undercover collection always has, as its name suggests, a subtext. This season, the pacifist Takahashi weighed in on the origins of current world conflicts. On the soundtrack, John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band raged against organized religion (“I don’t believe in Jesus...I don’t believe in Buddha”) while the twins massed together for a finale wearing T-shirts reading, “Violence invites violence,” “Silly to kill,” and “Who wants to be a soldier.”</p></div>"
108,spring,2004,s2004,valentino,"When the fashion chat is all about the ""new ladylike,"" it's not hard to give in to the methods of seduction Valentino has perfected. He's had ""lady"" down pat for years—for the genuine ones of the yacht-owning class, that is. His Spring collection covers the waterfront for that society, and those who aspire to it.</p><p>Valentino knows exactly how to translate this season's messages about lace and lingerie into infinitely fragile corseted dresses with gently falling frills. How to tie up a little rose chiffon dress with a lavender ribbon. How to decorate a summer suede jacket with a smattering of sequined bobbles, and fashion a suit out of the lightest, palest liquid satin. Get him on the subject of nautical, and he will show (on his friend Naomi Campbell, no less) how pristinely perfect something as simple as a pair of white sailor pants and a navy silk sweater can look.</p><p>There was also a theme of butterflies flitting through this collection in prints, on canvas day bags, belts, and hair ornaments, and set into the clasps of metal mesh evening purses. It all looked romantically pretty in the just-so mode that his clients adore. Yet the applause for this show was for the ultimately feminine evening pieces that appeared in his finale: an extraordinary turquoise draped jersey goddess dress, and a single, brilliant red chiffon ruffled gown, short in front and trailing out behind. It's the stuff of fantasy, certainly. But in Valentino's world, it's also the reality that will keep his many fans coming back for more.</p></div>"
109,spring,2004,s2004,vera-wang,"Pretty may be the trend for spring, but it’s nothing new for Vera Wang; she’s made a career of unfussy elegance. Her latest collection, full of lovely, understated separates and drop-dead gowns that are red-carpet ready, showcased her undeniable skill.</p><p>She touched on the season’s mood with stunning jersey goddess gowns in rich green and brilliant red that worked as perfect foils to Wang's diamond jewelry. The twenties feeling came up via cocktail dresses embroidered with scallops of gold thread and, in one example, embellished with a tart chartreuse ribbon. The slightly raised waistline that she used throughout the collection—even a snug navy coat had a high belt at the back—referred to a gentler, more ladylike era without ever getting sentimental or overly retro. In fact, Wang knows how to keep it modern, too: She paired a classic smoking with the most feminine tops (think pleated tulle, embroidered net) and beautifully-cut tuxedo trousers, a totally contemporary look that provided the perfect balance to her plethora of charming party dresses.</p></div>"
110,spring,2004,s2004,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho resists categorization. Though a citizen of Antwerp, she’s never been a Belgian Goth—but neither does she quite belong to the sunny, frilly side of fashion. Her focus, instead, is on making clothes that will allow young women to enjoy their femininity without somehow compromising their dignity. Her summer centers around just a few sound, unfreakish ideas: plain satin shift dresses and lace-trimmed slips, fine decorative camisoles and pleated wrap skirts.</p><p>Branquinho’s sensitive details include wing-shaped beaded motifs on the front of T-shirts, sheer trimmings at the base of scooped-out backs, and lace bandeau bras as underpinnings. She methodically offers those pieces, without fanfare or conceptual presentation, in black, cream, or vibrant vermilion. The mixed black-and-white striped print, or the occasional trenchcoat and ombré-dyed dress shading from brown to red varied her message. It didn’t qualify as one of the blockbusters of Paris fashion week, but when it comes down to summer wearability, Branquinho’s contribution on the subjects of lingerie and dresses looks appealingly practical.</p></div>"
111,spring,2004,s2004,versace,"With Beyoncé and Mariah Carey lined up as her front-row celebrity focus group, it came as no surprise when Donatella Versace trotted out an eye-popping spectacle of color and print. Versace’s multihued petal power overflowed with hothouse citrus, turquoise, pink, and violet—all those shades that look best in the sun, on utterly bodacious bodies.</p><p>Using a combination of stretchy draped tops, thigh-hugging pedal pushers, and a huge rush of floral gowns, Versace reprised something of the exuberant eighties optimism for which her brother Gianni was known. (Linda Evangelista walked the show as a reminder of those high old days.) There were halternecks, bra tops, and flouncy rumba blouses. A turquoise suit—if a jacket and a pair of micro shorts qualifies for such a description—came printed with magenta daisies. Tiny chiffon ruffles trimmed everything from plunging necklines on trailing evening gowns to provocative bikini bottoms. There were some calmer moments, like white suits and a couple of tooled leather, frill-embellished jackets and coats. But as the models strode up and down, big hair bouncing and curves outlined to the max, this looked like a collection aimed directly at divas.</p></div>"
112,spring,2004,s2004,versus-versace,"A runway collection inspired by a furniture movement: Is this a first? The Versus line for Spring 2004 was a fashion version of Memphis, Ettore Sottsass’s early eighties design company. Donatella Versace applied the group’s graphic blocks, striped bands, and screwy clashes of primary and pastel colors to all things tight and short, strapping clothes onto the body with stretchy harnesses or wide elasticized bands. Meanwhile, a mammoth screen at the back of the set showed lithe silhouettes dancing against the offbeat patterns—one like a print of medicine capsules—that appeared on the clothes.</p><p>The result may have been cleaner and more athletic than Versace’s usual trashed-up, rock-chick vision, but it was a sharp departure from the sweet and girly message the rest of Milan has been putting out. On the other hand, the odd bizarre item (like a teal-and-salmon printed leather anorak; or a pair of crazy multi-striped, color-blocked wedges) might strike a girl as just the thing to break up the monotony of next summer’s wall-to-wall prettiness.</p></div>"
113,spring,2004,s2004,viktor-rolf,"Here’s what fashion people expect of a Viktor &amp; Rolf show: surreal twists on convention and mind-bending sculptural exaggerations of normal clothing, ending in a crescendo of all-out applause for the quiet genius of the straight-faced Dutch duo. In a week when the two have celebrated their ten-year collaboration with an exhibition of their impressive body of work at the Musée de la Mode, the anticipation of the Spring show was ratcheted even higher than usual.</p><p>Strangely, though, this collection somehow failed to rise to the occasion. The well-established signatures—masculine/feminine tailoring, denims, and details like big, overblown bows—ranged the runway in many variations, but a high concept never quite materialized. A lot of audience second-guessing went on as the show progressed. Was this Viktor &amp; Rolf’s statement of post-conceptual commerciality? Were all the big white shirts and softened shapes their new ironic take on bourgeois ordinariness? If so, many of the pieces were rather too literally banal to jolt a reaction.</p><p>The designers’eveningwear picked up strength, with versions of tuxedo jackets cut so as to hang off the shoulder (a dangling motif that is recurring throughout the Spring collections). More promising still were the interpretations of grand 1950’s tulle evening gowns, their skirts morphed onto men’s dinner suits. At a time when young avant-garde designers are reinvestigating the beauty of traditional Parisian couture, that was a tantalizing contribution to the season. But it left Viktor &amp; Rolf’s fans longing for more.</p></div>"
114,spring,2004,s2004,y-3,"Go, team! With sports-inspired clothes becoming ever more firmly entrenched in the every person wardrobe, Y-3—Yohji Yamamoto’s collaboration with Adidas—is practically a fail-safe proposition. For spring, the project hit its mark with a high-energy collection that went from simple jackets and warm-ups to sleekly sexy swimsuits.</p><p>As might be expected from a line that celebrates the sporting life, the tops, trousers, and skirts were mostly kept lean, while anoraks and sweatshirts were oversized and slouchy, meant to be worn slipping off the shoulders. There were some specific references to track and field: referee stripes on maillots, for example, or plastic panels inspired by motocross boots attached to jacket sleeves. Mostly, though, Y-3 concentrated on making over generally utilitarian pieces like trim jackets and skirts with high-tech fabrics and sharp color combinations: black, white, and gray flashed with hot pink and electric blue.</p><p>Yamamoto’s sense of irreverence could be felt throughout. Logos were blown up to cartoonish proportions; men sported hot pink hoodies; a strapless one-piece sweatsuit was supersized way beyond the realm of the sporty. He also worked with Japanese artist Saeko Tsuemura on comic book–style graphics that were printed on tank dresses, fluid jersey pants, and generous wraparound leather jackets. Overall, it was enough to lure even hard-core couch potatoes into a shopping trip—preferably after a visit to the gym.</p></div>"
115,spring,2004,s2004,ys-yohji-yamamoto,"Having shifted his main collection to a slot during Paris's couture week, Yohji Yamamoto has deputized his secondary line, Y's, to represent him at the ready-to-wear shows. That didn't deter his audience, which was sitting up straight, pens poised, raring to see what new crimp the great innovator would be putting on the season. How about gauzy, droopy white knits and what looked like sweaters, dangling upside down from suspenders, worn as pants?</p><p>Legs in sleeves notwithstanding, Yamamoto’s floating, A-line asymmetries had the easy, nonaggressive air that has characterized his work from the beginning. Yet as model after model in neutral, wrinkled layers of crispy knit and floppy satin kept wandering down the runway, it became clear that there was not a lot of incisive new thinking going on. Things perked up when he sent out a shot of intense red washed satin, and a gentle version of the season’s shirt-dressing theme; otherwise, underwhelming was the word for it. Sure, Yamamoto is being realistic in showing his accessibly-priced collection now. But in the Paris spotlight, the world still expects more from him than a routine dilution of house standards.</p></div>"
116,spring,2004,s2004,yohji-yamamoto,"Once again, Yohji Yamamoto chose to show his Ready-to-Wear line during Couture, a full two months ahead of the usual schedule. This Spring collection, he said, was an exercise in “doing something graphic.” That meant working squares of fabric, linked Paco Rabanne–style with metal rings, into many variations of bodices, which came attached to long, flowing skirts. The surprise was the sense of body that came through—literally. Though he stayed almost entirely with his habitual black, cutting pinafore dresses and overalls suspended from complex straps and ties, the torso beneath was naked, save for body paint, applied in chalky blocks by Shiseido. The focus was mainly on evening, save for a series of arty takes on that most American of classic looks: the white tee and jeans. Skintight gauze T-shirts, again stretched over painted torsos, were paired with baggy, low-hanging, washed-out denims, a cross-bred version of hip-hop pants and Japanese workwear. The one shot of color in the show arrived in the footwear: chunky foam platform flip-flops—some attached to toeless, heel-less neoprene socks—in bright red, leaf green, turquoise, and yellow, that came over as a sporty take on Japanese geta. Naturally, all were emblazoned with three white go-faster stripes, in a nod to the designer’s ongoing collaboration with Adidas.</p></div>"
117,spring,2004,s2004,zac-posen,"He’s not just a one-hit wonder, after all. In a lovely and lively Spring collection, Zac Posen showed he can move beyond the hourglass diva dresses and turn out some seriously pretty clothing.</p><p>Posen’s whole silhouette eased up as he worked in lighter fabrics like charmeuse and chiffon, and in a classic pastel palette of lilac, petal pink, pale green, and shimmery gray. Skillful tailoring showed up in short jackets artfully seamed to curve in at the waist, and a delicate touch was apparent in pieces like a halter dress suspended from a single, thin twist of fabric. Still in evidence were handkerchief-point hems on a few short dresses and skirts, as well as a few of his signature mitre-stripe gowns. It’s clear that Posen has been taking notes during his many appearances on the social circuit: His eveningwear, like a silvery sequined dress or a flame-red chiffon gown, will certainly delight the cocktail-and-gala crowd. And indeed, the whole show had a distinct sparkle, thanks to the $30 million worth of Harry Winston gems (on loan, of course) the models were sporting.</p><p>Lest his audience might think he’d lost his costume-y sense of humor, Posen also sent out two dangerously flammable outfits made from raffia—inspired, perhaps, by the wild Philip Treacy wigs on show at Manolo Blahnik’s current New York exhibit.</p></div>"
118,spring,2004,s2004,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo designs for women who prefer sleek and spare over pretty and perky, and her cool, even-tempered Spring collection was a refreshing counterpoint to the season’s plethora of lace and ruffles. Cornejo opened with a series of clean, narrow dresses and skirts in black and white jersey, gently enlivened with inserts and sashes made from pale blue silk.</p><p>She limited herself to four colors, but kept the outfits interesting by juxtaposing fabrics like Ultrasuede and charmeuse. Even when the jolts of red came out, in a gently ruched dress, a stretch mini, and a pair of cotton shorts, they seemed more studied than outright sexy. Cornejo’s proportions owe a debt to Japan in general, and designers like Issey Miyake in particular, but she puts her own stamp on things by way of body-conscious cuts and modern fabrics.</p></div>"
1,fall,2004,f2004,a-f-vandevorst,"First, the bad news. While there was much to admire in A.F. Vandevorst's Fall show, there were a few reasons why it didn't fly quite as well as it could have. It's never a good idea to present your collection way out of the center of Paris at night—a very cold night, at that—and then keep your audience shivering on the sidelines for more than an hour in subzero temperatures. Serving Champagne—chilled, <em>naturellement</em>—might score brownie points with some, but at this stage in the evening hot cocoa would probably have been a bigger hit. Just why it was so cold became apparent when the show finally started. An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, the duo behind the label, had opened up the vast auditorium in order to allow the models to enter from outside, deposited by a fleet of Lexus limousines that drew up at the entrance.</p><p>Once the girls started to stalk the square runway in a complicated formation sequence, things began to heat up: An and Filip put their own sharp twist on the pretty, polished femininity that's a recurring theme this season, with a smart tie-belted cardigan jacket in a magnified houndstooth tweed; a lacquered black lace circle skirt; and a decidedly chic cream bouclé tweed coat. The good news also included the now-trademark looks with which they opened and closed the proceedings—a belted trench with voluminous caped sleeves.</p><p>Intermixed with these standouts, however, were endless military-influenced jackets and shirts strewn with braiding, or pinned with medals. It may have been a comment on war and the military, but it led the collection directly into no-man's-land—and a chilly one, at that.</p></div>"
2,fall,2004,f2004,akris,"Every season has one or two of those shows where a well-respected but not terribly exciting line suddenly whips off its glasses, undoes a few buttons, and shakes out its topknot, leaving jaded fashion-world regulars stuttering over their words and groping for notebooks. This time, that delightful transformation happened at the venerable, 60-year-old Swiss company Akris. There's always been an upper-echelon customer for its painstakingly perfect suits and coats, but over the past few years, with Albert Kriemler (son of founder Max Kriemler) at the helm, Akris has been quietly freshening and lightening its designs, and fall's show proved the transformation complete.</p><p>As much as this season's frill and flourish are fun to look at, ultimately women want clothes that can survive a grab-and-go lifestyle while still performing the important role of personal enhancement. Enter Akris' nip-waist jackets, trim trousers, pencil skirts, and snappy coats cut from cashmere, tweed, suede, and lamb, worn with luxe cashmere sweaters or silky tunics. Those kinds of basics can easily turn boring, but Kriemler has a gift for proportion and cut, and he managed to balance all the elements—rough with polish, bulky with airy—without getting bogged down in tradition. The silky dresses and gowns that closed the show emitted just the right amount of subtle sex appeal. And, while his fluttery smocked chiffon tops may have Swiss milkmaid in their genealogy, their flirty confidence was purely modern-day.</p></div>"
3,fall,2004,f2004,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti's dressmaker sensibility is a trump card in a season that's all about the pretty-vintage look. Her abiding love of fluttery fabrics, allied to her ability to cut a nice coat, made for a collection that trod a light path through the current trends.</p><p>Opening with a soft, raw-edged tweed coat, Ferretti hit on an easy direction that stayed just the right side of prissy. Using a motif of circular cuts with unfinished seams, she whipped up little silk dresses with multiple tiers in absinthe green, dusty amethyst, faded harebell, and poudre pink. For warmth—it's winter, after all—she added printed fur jackets and stoles, opaque tights, and chunky wedges.</p><p>With their hair in slightly mussed bouffant ponytails and their eyes smudged with dark eyeliner, Ferretti's girls projected a kind of undone, retro glamour that made the prospect of winter dressing-up look almost easy.</p></div>"
4,fall,2004,f2004,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Is eccentric the new normal? That's the odd inversion beginning to spring to mind, as more and more shows fall in uniformly behind the E word. Of course, there's nothing deranged or random about most Milanese designers' choice of inspiration: They know a commercial direction when they see one. In Alessandro Dell'Acqua's case, he called up an out-there muse of the moment in the form of Courtney Love, as he imagines she¿d look after rummaging through a twenties wardrobe that was actually designed in the seventies.</p><p>What does that mean? Antique-looking tiered velvet dresses pulled on over sweaters and glitter-heeled ankle-strap shoes, for a start. But this wasn't wholly a dose of grunge revisited after a heavy night out. For an indigenous angle on early seventies glamour, Dell'Acqua referenced the late cult Italian design hero Walter Albini. That came through in Lurex knits, worn with matching jersey turbans and paired with high-waist flares, and in a reprise of the mixed Deco-patterned jacquard sweaters that were part of Albini's nostalgic métier.</p><p>One outfit—a loopy pink-mohair backless sweater, worn with a sparkly silver shirt collar and a pair of white pants—nailed the disco-fabulous era nicely. There was rather more Miuccia than Courtney in this collection (fabric-covered, beaded disc brooches landed on jackets and dresses), but few designers anywhere can completely escape the influence of Milan's own great homegrown eccentric—especially this season.</p></div>"
5,fall,2004,f2004,alexander-mcqueen,"It's only understandable that if the man who's been at the eye of the whirlwind of negotiations about taking up the reins at Yves Saint Laurent might have been thrown into an emotional spin. As we now know, Alexander McQueen turned down the offer, saying that it was far more important for him to concentrate on his own label. But although his fundamental instincts may be sound, the pain, strain, and self-questioning of recent weeks showed in this collection.</p><p>McQueen's intention, he said, was to strip away ""all theatrics and focus purely on design."" In one way, his declaration is right on: Fashion, hedged about with so much overcomplicated stuff, does feel in want of a good, rigorous cleansing. Perhaps that's why the show looked like a strange kind of rebirthing. His first model, in flesh-pale slippery jersey from top to toe, looked like an embryonic alien being, stepping with horrible vulnerability from a spacecraft onto a kind of landing pad. She led out a parade of similarly nude-colored outfits in tweed, double-faced cashmere, leather, jersey, and chiffon, in which McQueen seemed to be trying to summarize the essence of his design identity. He pared it down to some of his familiar shapes—jumpsuits, molded hourglass coats, nipped-waist suits—all shorn of the elaborate fabrics and embroideries of past seasons. The best of his coats was an ivory swing-skirted shearling, one of the most believably commercial items in the collection.</p><p>Yet, throughout there was a sense that the audience was waiting for the moment when this sci-fi-accented show would take off in the usual, thrilling, turbo-charged McQueen manner. A couple of frosted Mongolian-lamb hooded jackets almost did it, but then the mood subsided again into evening, where the long jersey draped dresses looked as if they might have been designed in a mood when McQueen's mind really had been turned toward Saint Laurent.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ii5f08""></div></div><p>It was a pity—if only human—that the collection didn't quite live up to expectations at such a crucial time for McQueen. But then again, this is fashion. There's always next season.</p></div>"
6,fall,2004,f2004,ann-demeulemeester,"As Ann Demeulemeester's show drew to a close, it seemed the unthinkable was about to happen. The collection, shown to a sweeping, dramatic, classical score, had not a whisper (or, more appropriately, a wail) from the Belgian designer's favorite chanteuse, Patti Smith. But then the orchestra's strings faded—and the opening chords of Smith's <em>Horses</em> rang out.</p><p>Expecting Demeulemeester to abandon Smith would be akin to seeing her show bright, pretty florals: It's just never going to happen. She has laid claim to a dark, gothic sensibility that variously embraces military uniforms, slouchy tailoring, and raw-edged shearlings and furs mixed with tough leathers. The results tend to be of varying returns: sometimes rather wonderful, sometimes not.</p><p>This collection wasn't far from the former category. The drawbacks were the buckled straps that messily crisscrossed fur vests and dipping asymmetric skirts, and her penchant for partnering her sharp leather or ponyskin biker-style jackets with jodhpurs—surely up there with jumpsuits as one of the worst things a woman can wear. This aside, there was a lot that was good: narrow-shouldered, high-collared coats that buttoned on the side and oversized blousons that were based on the trench, the volume kept under control by their low-slung belts. And there were some wonderful surprises: a flash of silver from chain mail minis layered with big sweaters and tight pants; glossy leather gauntlets whose cuffs were lavished with fur; and a color palette that strayed beyond black to include chestnut brown, soft vanilla, and winter white—the latter at its best in a glazed-leather trenchcoat.</p></div>"
7,fall,2004,f2004,anna-molinari,"Bette Midler playing Janis Joplin in <em>The Rose</em> meets Virginia Woolf. Such are the entertaining tropes being used backstage to explain the outbreak of individualism in fall's fashion; that combination specifically was Rossella Tarabini's brief for the collection she designs under her mother's name.</p><p>The reality was thankfully much simpler. The house of Molinari always finds a way to do pretty dresses, whatever the mood of the season. This time, it was ragbag antique glamour with a seventies accent. Close up, the dresses—highly worked amalgams of dévoré velvet, chiffon, and outcrops of sparkly beading—could almost have been the trophies girls boast about finding at Saturday-morning flea markets. Aged and crinkled gold lameés, apparently retrieved after decades in great-granny's attic, reappeared in smocks and tiered skirts tied around the middle with silver sequinned belts.</p><p>Something always comes along to break the suspension of disbelief, of course; here, it was the decidedly contemporary colorways (from chrome yellow through violet and purple) and multiple variations on the theme. But when these drifty, faux-moldered frocks turn up in shops this fall, they're exactly the kinds of things the young Secondhand Roses and would-be Virginias will fall on with gusto.</p></div>"
8,fall,2004,f2004,anna-sui,"One of the things that makes Anna Sui’s show a Fashion Week crowd-pleaser is that she always seems to be having fun. She plays great rock ‘n’ roll, seeds the front row with her groovy friends (Sofia Coppola, Vincent Gallo, the sexily ravaged Psychedelic Furs singer Richard Butler) and gets the best models to sashay down her runway. And whether you take to her retro-boho pastiche sensibility or not, you always walk out smiling.</p><p>For fall, Sui rummaged through the great moments of glitter rock and summoned the ghost of Biba, the legendary late-sixties London boutique, with its stylized forties vibe and clientele of chic, dissolute waifs. She crimped the models’ hair, put them in brightly printed opaque tights and Cuban heels, then sent them out in colorful cardigans paired with flared skirts, suits enlivened by velvet trim, floaty ruffled printed dresses, and lingerie looks like bed jackets and lace-trimmed satin skirts. Restraint? What’s that? There were lamé boots, lamé gloves, lamé jackets, and lamé trim on her boot-cut jeans. She kept the accessories crew busy, loading each look with gold chains, wrapping leopard belts over jackets and coats, and pinning lots of brooches to lapels. It could easily have been discordant, but under Sui’s guidance the result was a burst of much-needed cheerful noise.</p></div>"
9,fall,2004,f2004,as-four,"Call up the As Four studio, and the voice at the other end will answer, “Future Planet of Style.” The flamboyantly avant-garde quartet applied a literal interpretation to that epithet this season, designing their first children’s clothes as part of a presentation they called <em>Ageless</em>. Throughout the show, kids—or, to use their official title, As Children—walked onto the silver stage in petaly getups that were one part Peter Pan whimsy, one part Halloween costume—and completely adorable.</p><p>The proceedings featured all the usual off-the-wall stimuli: a performance by the Icelandic Puppet Company; a soundtrack that mixed a tinkly, music box-like composition by Dan and Ben Brunnemer with clips from Vince Guaraldi’s <em>Charlie Brown</em> theme, Nina Hagen, and Shirley Temple; the antics of As Four’s pit bull, Powder; and the presence of the equally pugnacious Vincent Gallo. But like a children’s book that contains a message for adults, the presentation had depth as well as distraction. Adi, Ange, Gabi, and Kai undertook an inventive, tightly focused reworking of that proper wardrobe staple, Le Smoking. The group’s 13 all-black variations encompassed everything from lace leggings to a metallic-wool sweater to a look named the “Oscardress” that would be viable on the red carpet—and not just on Björk. “The collection,” said Kai after the show, “embodies the idea of what we call elegance—but can’t wear because we can't afford a cleaning lady!”</p></div>"
10,fall,2004,f2004,badgley-mischka,"When Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin sang, “I wanna give you every inch of my love,” he never seemed to have beads, tulle, and satin on his mind. Nonetheless, it was an apt (if remixed) soundtrack choice for Badgley Mischka, who passionately embellished inches—yards, actually—of luxurious fabrics for their fall show.</p><p>The result was a collection of amazing dresses meant for the kind of life that requires, well, lots of amazing dresses. Two semi-sheer tulle pieces, with caviar-size beads clinging to them like a shadow, stood out, as did a more formal evening gown in floor-length satin lamé. Daytime looks included suits and tight, embellished hunting jackets, often in herringbone. Other highlights: a mahogany mink coat with embroidered medallions and a burgundy shearling and mink coat that, despite a whole lotta luxe materials, avoided going over the top. No mean feat.</p></div>"
11,fall,2004,f2004,balenciaga,"Practical urban streetwear—a welcome rarity in these polite ladylike days—made a powerful re-entry into fall as Nicolas Ghesquière showed a slew of the aviator jackets he does so well at Balenciaga. He used them to open his collection, bonding generous curly goat-hair shearling lapels onto cavalry twill and pairing them with a pleated drop-waist pant, with a voluminous leg tapered to the ankle. Casual top, mannish bottom: It made for a loosened-up progression of Balenciaga's signature attractions.</p><p>It got better still when Ghesquière delved, with his usual rigor, into the house archive (""For the first time, I've done it,"" he said) to retrieve Cristobal Balenciaga's gazar balloon skirt. Paired with yet more tiny, nipped-waist flying jackets or his signature shrunken knits, the contrast was unexpected, contemporary, cool. Handling retro in a modern way? That's a rarity, too.</p><p>Still, Ghesquière can never keep himself away from an eighties reference—whether that means a Mugler-esque suit or a filmy nylon windbreaker—and this season he went there again with a few sporty motocross-cum-flying-suit assemblages inspired by a book about early eighties New York graffiti artists. His B-Girls, however, were followed by a pair of short, fluted coat-dresses, one in tweed with scrolled lapels, the other double-breasted, in black. For all their complex construction, they were outstanding examples of drop-dead simple French chic, made relevant for a new generation.</p></div>"
12,fall,2004,f2004,bcbg-max-azria,"After spring’s gently retro collection, Max Azria returned to a harder-edged feeling for fall, showing skinny pants, loose wrapped tops, draped dresses and generous blouson jackets that will help the young and the hip get through next season.</p><p>Although he cited Jean Harlow as an inspiration, Azria’s cuts and colors seemed drawn more from the seventies; what other decade would have dared put a mustardy yellow leather blouson with skinny royal-blue trousers, or a brown top, piped in blue, over red pants tucked into navy boots? The designer breathed some Hollywood glamour into daywear by mixing jewel-toned velvet pieces with sportier opposites like a long, bulky wool scarf or a pair of trousers cut from cotton bengaline. Then it was into the nightlife, where he boogied down with fluttery, skin-baring chiffon dresses and tops worn under slim-cut tuxedos—all guaranteed to win over any reluctant doorman.</p></div>"
13,fall,2004,f2004,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour knows how to set a mood with music. The soundtrack to her brief, sweet fall collection consisted solely of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s <em>Just Like Honey</em>, a hazy, romantic song that’s become inextricably linked to that last scene in <em>Lost in Translation</em>, where Bill Murray murmurs wistfully (and inaudibly) in the ear of Scarlett Johansson.</p><p>Sarafpour seemed in a bittersweet mood herself, having shaken off spring’s aggressive, patent-leather moment. She looked back to the innocence and femininity of the fifties with sunburst pleated skirts, crisp white shirts, and candy-colored cardigans delicately trimmed with ribbon and rosettes. The wide bateau neck on a lovely tweed dress gave the wearer an Audrey Hepburn grace, while a sturdy black wool trench or a brown tweed skirt with a fishtail hem evoked one of those mysterious, vulnerable, and ever-so-chic Hitchcock blondes. When it came to nighttime, however, Sarafpour snapped right back into the present, with slinky satin dresses held together by fragile lace butterflies and sparkly rhinestone collars dropped over T-shirts and satin dresses—very of the moment, and no translation required.</p></div>"
14,fall,2004,f2004,bill-blass,"In his second season as the designer for Bill Blass, Michael Vollbracht showed that he’s resolutely—some might say obstinately—devoted to the house’s heritage as a refuge of elegant sportswear. Emphasis on heritage: Vollbracht’s fall collection was almost a time capsule of Blass circa 1980, shown in a theatrical, dragged-out runway presentation that once again included some of Blass’ former house models, and clocked in at almost 80 looks.</p><p>Vollbracht has said from the start that he’s interested in dressing chic older women, the ones he feels fashion is neglecting. Nonetheless, modern business means appealing to a younger clientele and also catering to Hollywood’s insatiable appetite for glamorous gowns. At times, Vollbracht scored: A light butter-yellow wool crepe suit, or a rust corduroy jacket over a swingy kilt, had timeless cross-generational appeal. Other times, he missed: Too many of the double-faced wool and cashmere fabrics were tailored into long, boxy jackets that harked back to the old power-dressing days. Eveningwear was also a divided affair. A simple black chiffon halter dress with gold spangles creeping up from the hem was as pretty as could be, but a loose silk kimono jacket printed with a giant tiger (designed by Vollbracht, a gifted illustrator) needed to be tamed.</p><p>Vollbracht worked with Blass himself, so his firsthand knowledge of the great designer’s aesthetic can’t be questioned. But if he really wants to do justice to a great legacy, a little less reverence might help.</p></div>"
15,fall,2004,f2004,bottega-veneta,"In the nearly three years since Tomas Maier took over at Bottega Veneta, he's been inching methodically forward—from explaining the intricacies of the house bags and accessories to developing a full-fledged clothing line to go with them. What began as a few luxe sporty sweaters and jackets kept on a rack in the back is now a 60-piece collection, which Maier presented on models clustered on a series of podiums in the company showroom. ""It isn't like normal ready-to-wear,"" Maier explained. ""I had the concept of designing clothes like accessories. Everyone has their own personality, and will pick things out to wear in their own way.""</p><p>Maier's aesthetic is clean and ageless in spirit, with luxury worked in as a result of the extraordinary handcraft that goes into producing exclusive fabrics, prints, and finishes. He used salt-and-pepper baby tweed for coats, tunics, and pants; cashmere for double-layered cardigan coats in beige and chartreuse; and Deco-derived swirly and geometric prints for A-line skirts and drop-waisted dresses. The effect was feminine and modern, but it was still the accessories that kept the audience circling for a closer look. Most want-able are the new bags: a multicolored Mondrian-esque weave, a framed croc in poison green reissued from the sixties, and the chunky, rounded minaudières studded with tiger's-eye.</p></div>"
16,fall,2004,f2004,boudicca,"Boudicca are London's last remaining bastion of subversive design. ""The industry's boring right now,"" Zowie Broach said. ""Fashion has to be about more than just the clothes."" In a phase of standardized commercial showings, audiences welcome anything in the way of drama—always providing the clothes lead fashion somewhere new.</p><p>This season, Boudicca took to the stage of the Mermaid Theatre, creating a patch of moorland turf scored with what looked like chariot tracks, and played the soundtrack to the movie <em>Badlands</em>. Onto this melancholy heath strode a deeply hooded, black-clad figure, to open a collection that mixed sporty, protective clothing with sharp, militaristic coats lashed with narrow leather holsters. Called Hunter-Gatherer, the theme appeared to make some mysterious connection between Queen Boudicca's ancient British Iceni tribe and a modern post-apocalyptic dark age. Barbaric fur collars and heroic asymmetric stoles were slung around coats, interspersed with outfits made of slick, translucent hooded jackets and track pants. Among all this, Brian Kirkby's ace way of wielding the scissors produced the occasional amazingly fitted gored skirt that was beautifully in step with fall. That talent can't be obscured, but as a collection, it felt as if Boudicca had wandered back into a depressive place where few will understand.</p></div>"
17,fall,2004,f2004,burberry-prorsum,"In a Milan season that has seen even the most unlikely fashion houses embrace the concept of eccentricity, via quirky layering and madcap accessorizing, Burberry's Christopher Bailey was no exception. ""Very thirties-inspired,"" said Bailey of his charming show, more ironically ladylike and grown-up than his previous offerings—""a little bit Bloomsbury, but with a light spirit."" Of course, at this storied British company founded by Thomas Burberry in 1856 (and famed for the weatherproof clothes that kept the empire builders dry), Bailey has more claim than most to channel the eclecticism of his generation's It girls—who include the label¿s signature models, Kate Moss and Stella Tennant. (Stella was walking this season¿s runway.)</p><p>That thirties touch meant lingerie-light washed silky dresses in period colors including plum, teal, old rose, bottle green, and slate, and shapely coats with a military edge. And if the fluttering crepe scarves (some in a Schiaparelli-esque glove print), diaphanous cardigans, and swimsuit-backed frocks were surprising for a winter collection, the Burberry girl can keep warm with knitted hats and gloves in bright color accents. The retro palette extended to the hose, which was worn with thick-heeled 1940s lizard court shoes trimmed with crisp little bows.</p><p>But Bailey wasn't just thinking about dressing stiff-upper-lipped heroines like Celia Johnson in the weepy 1945 classic <em>Brief Encounter</em>. To a soundtrack of Status Quo, Elvis Costello, and the Communards, the designer leavened the nostalgia with a series of modern twists. As in seasons past, he played in subtle ways with the house's iconic trench coat—adding epaulets and knotted-leather buttons to skinny corduroy jackets, for instance, or veiling his looks with translucent plastic pieces like an electric-blue Mackintosh and a dramatic scarlet cape. Equally strong were the liquid silver and gold lamé fabrics used for skimpy, make-do-and-mend frocks, and a tiered coat that owed a debt to influential seventies London designers Ossie Clark, Jean Muir, and Bill Gibb—now enjoying a posthumous renaissance.</p></div>"
18,fall,2004,f2004,calvin-klein-collection,"It can’t be easy to take the wheel from a designer whose global name recognition is somewhere up there with Coca-Cola. So, it was understandable that Francisco Costa’s first collection as head of Klein’s women’s line, last spring, was somewhat tentative. Now it’s time for Costa to show that he’s fully in command, and his fall show came up disappointingly short.</p><p>Costa mixed supple, thin fabrics like washed silk, charmeuse, chiffon, gauzy mohair, and cashmere against bulkier wool felt, shearling, and ponyskin, in a typically limited color palette of black, ivory, cream, pinky-brown, steel blue, and peach. He showed flowing silk dresses and mid-calf skirts, slit up the thigh or sliced into awkward flaps along the hem, and loose, hip-length self-belted jackets. There were dramatic black motorcycle-type jackets, cut oversize from ponyskin or felt and worn over fragile underpinnings. Mixed into the outfits were some promising pieces: a short black wool jacket, a black angora and chiffon tank top, a sheer white shirt, some lovely pintucked dresses. But overall, the collection lacked exactly the kind of clean, effortless, coolly pretty clothes that Klein taught the world to want.</p></div>"
19,fall,2004,f2004,carolina-herrera,"Like the jaunty theme song from <em>The Triplets of Belleville</em> that looped through the soundtrack, Carolina Herrera’s fall show had infectious charm to spare. With her design team boosted by creative director Hervé Pierre and her daughter Patricia Lansing, Herrera’s designs have taken a turn for the lighter—always refined and feminine, but with a new sense of color and craft.</p><p>The inspiration for this collection was Europe’s grand ski resorts, but don’t look to Herrera for performance fabrics. This was old-school luxury at its best: buttery cashmere and alpaca, bulky knits and soft leathers in warm wintry colors (brown, deep blue, wine, and black), lavishly embellished with sable, mink, ermine, and fox. She kept it fresh with trim, flirty cuts, like knee-length skirts that flared just below the hips, and such intriguing details as roughed-up edges, cascades of square-edge ruffles, and fabrics stamped with patches of gold leaf.</p><p>Herrera amped things up for evening, creating a series of showstoppers. She dropped a gold fox-fur stole around the neck of a jade-green silk dress; stitched ripped bits of blue chiffon to a gorgeous chocolate gown; crocheted cream-colored cashmere into a ball skirt; and scattered bugle beads across an alpine sweater. The slopes have never looked so inviting.</p></div>"
20,fall,2004,f2004,celine,"So farewell, Michael Kors. In his exit collection for the label he's been designing since 1997, he conjured a straightforward roll call of ladylike personalities to wave good-bye to Paree. That meant, as he spelled out in his program note, ""The sporty American simplicity of C.Z. Guest and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy mixed with the youthful European sophistication of Leslie Caron, Jean Seberg and Audrey Hepburn."" In other words, no surprises, but a lot of luxe double-face camel-hair suits and coats, gray cashmeres, trim Donegal tweed, and <em>jeune fille</em> lace dance dresses.</p><p>Kors leaves Celine as he found it—a bourgeois, conservative French lifestyle label with a reputation for quality. His parting gesture—melding snappy, abbreviated mid-nineties American sportswear with mid-fifties European iconic fashion standards—efficiently summarized the kind of job he has done here. With never a hair or a seam out of place, and always scrupulously attentive to the correct matching of shoe and bag to ensemble, his chignoned ladies advanced in neat-waisted, belted, top-to-toe propriety. Working in a classic palette of beige, brown, gray, and red, Kors made his most ultra-deluxe daytime statements with a short, chocolate crocodile double-breasted jacket, and another in form-fitting astrakhan. For night, he worked the current feeling for fifties circle skirts into romantic, black, strapless lace-covered dance dresses, in honor of Audrey. As Kors took his final bow, he saluted Lawrence Stroll, the backer of his own eponymous New York label. That's where Kors's future now lies; as for Celine, the next chapter remains to be written. A successor to Kors is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p></div>"
21,fall,2004,f2004,chalayan,"A midday show under the gilded, chandeliered dome of the Grand Hotel in Paris, scene of so many haute couture presentations of old? You can't get more grown-up than that. To find Hussein Chalayan in these surroundings, rather than in some far-flung, freezing nighttime venue, made some in his audience sit up and do a double take. And so they should, for this choice of locale marked a watershed in the career of a designer who has been quietly moving from the experimental margins to a point of creative maturity. Guess what? Leave meanings and subtexts for a later discussion: First and foremost, Chalayan now wants us to look at his clothes.</p><p>And how wearably, beautifully in sync with the current dialogue about fifties couture/fur trim/pretty dresses those clothes turned out to be. Chalayan opened with a black fake-fur hooded coat, a fur-collared skirtsuit, and a sculptural fur-trimmed cape sitting atop a waisted bodice and a bubble skirt. Right there, without labored references, he nailed his claim to reinterpreting the silhouette, emphasizing a neat torso with gentle volume beneath.</p><p>Chalayan's original mind makes the leap from old world to new by fusing in elements of modern sportswear. He cuts jackets that incorporate trompe l'oeil boleros, horn duffel-coat toggles, baseball jacket-style knit ribbing, and frilled peplums—and still look unfussy. He's also doing his part to ease along the changing shape of trousers with his neat-waisted, wide-leg sailor pants. Chalayan's dusty-pink shearling jackets and coats, cut to a slim, flattering line with luxurious high collars, had more of those little peplums in back. And he ended by proving—to any remaining disbelievers—that he has a sensitive touch with eveningwear. After a few elegantly drapey silk-printed, thirties looks, he closed with short puffball dresses appliquéd with patches of embroidery.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""f1vdb8""></div></div><p>Later, Chalayan said that his show was based on the concept of solitude and personal identity. Perhaps, as an independent, self-financing designer amid a globalized industry, he feels those pressures more than others do. But in this collection, the aloneness of his talent shone with an exceptional brightness.</p></div>"
22,fall,2004,f2004,chanel,"Mercurial and easily bored as he is, Karl Lagerfeld knows exactly how to pick an appropriate Chanel theme—and when to drop it in a flash. For summer, his camellia-fresh pastel suits pinned down the ladylike mood to perfection; but now he's taken another of his 180-degree turns, setting off down the masculine/feminine road. Of course, that's hardly an egregious direction for this house. Coco Chanel went there first, when she purloined the jackets and cardigans of her British lover, Bendor, the Duke of Westminster, in the twenties and thirties. This season showed, for starters, exactly how far Chanel's iconic bouclé can stretch: dainty one moment, tweedy country-boyish the next.</p><p>The opening suits, in mixes of brown, came out matched with newsboy caps in a collection that played fast and loose with Lagerfeld's notions about androgyny, urban streetwear, young dressing, and the old house staples. He literally put his kids on the street—a long asphalt road—and played tricks by sending out pretty boys among the girls. (A man in a Chanel braid-trimmed cardigan jacket: Now that <em>was</em> a first.)</p><p>Lagerfeld stages shows the way he speaks—in a stream-of-consciousness deluge of ideas, references, puns, jokes, and digressions that is often too much for mere mortals to take in. The only way to click onto his crowded information superhighway is to stay calm, look for the big message (jackets and a proposed pant revival), and zero in on the items you'd like to wear. There were plenty of the latter—small jackets in oversized houndstooth tweed, coats in raggedy windowpane check, cute bags in tweed, miniature chain classics in black velvet or green mink, a novelty purse in the shape of a perfume bottle.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""wm9jmp""></div></div><p>Of the many non-tweedy ideas that came down the runway, some looked merely distracting, like an airing of the Chanel skiwear line, while others provided some calm, chic moments amid the melee. Three variations on men's velvet pantsuits (one with a cream lace jabot blouse) touched on a Little Lord Fauntleroy version of cross-dressing. And for those evenings when, frankly, a girl just wants to be a girl, there were a couple of gorgeous black, sequinned, thirties-inspired evening dresses.</p></div>"
23,fall,2004,f2004,cher-michel-klein,"Brave is the designer who decides to show his comeback collection under the stormy skies of an inclement Paris evening. Well, not strictly outside, but in the courtyard of the École des Beaux-Arts' Cour du Mûrier. Even braver is adding a snow machine that generates a storm of artificial sleet over the audience and the models. Perhaps Michel Klein—the hardy soul who made these decisions—felt that he had to come up with a show to remember. In which case, best start with the clothes.</p><p>Klein's collection was representative of a problem that has cropped up more than a few times this week:a few good looks lurking under the weight of a heavy-handed, generally old-fashioned approach to clothes. His shrunken cardigan worn with a full skirt, or a jacket with tattered and frayed mousseline panels on the shoulder, made a convincing case for his return. It's harder to imagine under what circumstances a woman would ever need—or want—a black georgette flared jumpsuit. And if any more evidence of Klein's bravery was needed, then it was his use of scarabs as a decorative leitmotif. They came swarming over an ivory silk kimono or printed onto the back of a Le Smoking, with more crawling up the sides of the pant legs. Creepy-crawly chic: That's one tough sell.</p></div>"
24,fall,2004,f2004,chloe,"Phoebe Philo hit her stride at Chloé with a neat view of how to get around the season's classic themes without ending up in middle-aged Frumpsville. Town-and-country styling, mannish trousers, camel coats, cable knits, conservative blouses, and fifties-femme dresses were all in her collection, but Philo applied a refreshing dash of girl-think to such pressing questions as, Will my butt look big in that?, and, Won't it make me look like Mom?</p><p>She¿d worked out a hip way of handling horsey. A generous camel-hair wrap and a big brown-and-white striped poncho nodded toward their horse-blanket origins without making a big deal of it. With them came the new Chloé pants, an item this young woman always cuts with a scrupulous eye for the crucial back view. Her wide-leg, cuffed trousers achieved the borrowed-from-your-man look while also conspiring to flatter, a point she proved by wearing a pair herself when she appeared at the end of the show.</p><p>What's nice, too, is Philo's knack for breaking up looks with her favorite little tops, like gathered-under-the-bust camisoles. They can lighten up, say, a pair of glen plaid pants or go just as well with everyday jeans. She also managed to navigate blouses, in high-necked cream lace or pin-tucked emerald satin, without making them seem insufferably prim.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gqnsvk""></div></div><p>True, some of her retro-influenced chiffon dresses couldn't escape the inevitable comparison to Marc Jacobs. But that's true of many collections this season, and it didn't detract from Philo's breezily cool grasp of what young women really want to wear.</p></div>"
25,fall,2004,f2004,christian-dior,"John Galliano has already proved how far he can push it with iconoclastic delirium at Christian Dior. Making over the staid old ""madam"" house to become a global, cash-creating engine for bags, perfume, cosmetics: Done. Faces painted in exaggerated theatrical/clown/kabuki masks: Done. Showing an over-exaggerated version of what will appear in stores? Seen and understood.</p><p>Galliano was up to his old merge-meister devices again for fall. The collection, he explained, was inspired by illustrated <em>Vogue</em> covers from the 1900s, using them as a route through to the Edwardiana/teddy boy revival of the 1950s. What that basically boiled down to was introducing humongous, Poiret-style fur-collared coats into the rockabilly canon of neon leopard spot, vast Elvis-does-Vegas lamé draped jackets, and 4-inch crepe-soled brothel creepers. It was, as usual, taken to the absolute theatrical max—which produced only an exhausted sense of been there, done that.</p><p>There were, among all this, some of the pretty, fragile evening dresses that Galliano confects so well: one in ice blue, sheathed in silver sparkles, another in eau de nil frilled with watery chiffon. Lovely—but these, too, now have the inevitable feel of a design sensibility set to autopilot. Fashion, especially now, needs to be astonished by new approaches to creating beauty for modern times. In the fall 1994 collection that won him his deserved place in the Parisian establishment, a pre-Dior Galliano proved himself prodigiously capable of that with only a few yards of black silk. If he could retrieve his sense of that dreamy simplicity, it would count for more than all the cacophonous entertainment he lays on now.</p></div>"
26,fall,2004,f2004,christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix returned to a real runway show this season after taking a 2-year hiatus, and looking at the clothes, it felt as if he'd never been away. Lacroix marches to his own drum, which means that there have been moments when he was been out of step with the rest of the fashion world (during the minimalism of the late nineties, for example). These days, of course, color and ornamentation have become the look du jour; so it should, by rights, be a Lacroix moment.</p><p>If only it were that simple. It's not hard to expect that Lacroix's break from shows, plus his success at Pucci, might have pushed him forward a bit. Yet it felt that things hadn't quite gotten up to speed. He's still just as assured in matters of decoration and color, and his silhouette was much less complicated than in the past. What worked was a plaid trench and blouson, a slim metallic floral coat, and, for evening, an Edwardian-looking lace blouse and floor-sweeping ruffled skirt. But his approach to putting all this together could get a little fussy and overwrought. Sure, odd-looking huge floral corsages are obviously meant just for runway wear, but they still detract from the clothes underneath.</p><p>If Lacroix needs a fresh direction, he could perhaps take a lesson from his own menswear. The few pieces he showed (it's a new venture for him) had all his characteristic richness—the claret velvet blazer with pink-and-khaki-checked tweed trousers or the gray tweed coat worn over a baby-blue hoodie—but worn with a beautifully modern, casual ease.</p></div>"
27,fall,2004,f2004,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro has always designed into the eclectic, decorative, nostalgic way of dressing the duo calls ""clunky couture."" Now, with the fashion mood swinging distinctly in its direction, the husband and wife team has come up with a great-looking take on glam eccentricity.</p><p>The first model set the tone, in a scrappy fox shrug, dippy dress patchworked from circus print and polka dots, and a smearing of emerald eye shadow. Part YSL forties collection, part King's Road glamorette, she looked like a vision of the mad, imaginative way young London girls put themselves together in the early seventies. With signature patterned cashmeres, coats in leopard spot or appliquéd with flowers, and a slew of pretty, undone party dresses, it looked like a great way to get that requisite deranged-decadent look for fall. ""I just felt it's time to do something more opulent and gorgeous,"" said Suzanne Clements, who said she and her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, had been inspired by that classic documentary of aristocratic eccentricity, <em>Grey Gardens</em>.</p></div>"
28,fall,2004,f2004,comme-des-garcons,"What was it that made Comme des Garçons' Rei Kawakubo, the leading light of intellectual fashion, decide to show at the Lido, the Parisian nightclub famed for its high-kickin' dancers? As Kawakubo¿s show progressed, no clear answer emerged. What the models wore was certainly a whole lot more substantial than anything that has graced the stage of the Lido in the past: The designer reworked the black jacket, showing it with full leg-o'-mutton sleeves and trimmed with bows and feathers. Some of these jackets were twisted around or looked like they¿d been intricately cut to be worn tied onto the body. In turn, they were partnered with endless variations on a black skirt: some with pleated taffeta bustles, others designed to be worn backward, a few short versions veiled in tulle. Also thrown into the equation were a few pairs of striped, pleated pants that looked like they might have started life as part of a morning suit.</p><p>What was clear was that Kawakubo was on tried-and-tested ground, returning to concepts she has explored in the past: the Victorian and Edwardian eras; the boundaries between masculine and feminine; and the purity of black. Still, those themes didn¿t stop the imagination from running riot, dreaming up little narratives to explain just why she had chosen this venue. Perhaps her muse was some kind of starchy, turn of the century governess who had run off to a life of debauchery and been ravished at the club? That would certainly explain the askew jackets and the smeared red lipstick. When it comes to Kawakubo's clothes, the possibilities are of course endless—which is sometimes how this show felt. There were some truly excellent pieces—the duchesse satin evening coats, in particular—but her showgirls could have gotten the messages across with far fewer turns.</p></div>"
29,fall,2004,f2004,costume-national,"Now, here's a conundrum. You are a designer who has created a highly successful signature that's marked by a way of dressing that's slick and sexy. But fashion is shifting away from that toward more romantic, dreamy, eclectic territory. What do you do? If you are Costume National's Ennio Capasa, you attempt to move to pastures (somewhat) new, by softening up and adding a richer sense of detail and decoration. Capasa's change in direction is also driven by the launch of the label's diffusion line, C'N'C. ""With C'N'C being so casual,"" Capasa said, ""it was really time to make the main collection that much more luxurious and couture-inspired.""</p><p>Did it work? Somewhat. Capasa kept his silhouette close to the body as usual but broke up his usual ultra-minimal look with intricately seamed and paneled chiffon dresses, tight-fit flight jackets with billowing bell sleeves, and fur-collared zippered satin trenchcoats. And he introduced rich jewel tones—ruby, emerald, sapphire—mixing them with the omnipresent black. But mixing brights with black is tricky: Neither ever really comes off looking as good as it could. One longed for Capasa to nix the noir all together and to focus on working his Asian-meets-psychedelic-inspired palette throughout the collection. Sometimes moving on means you really do have to take a leap of faith and break with the past.</p></div>"
30,fall,2004,f2004,d-g,"With almost every designer in the universe referencing vintage these days, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana cut wittily to the chase, showing their D&amp;G line in a faux vintage store. Still, given how young women shop today, acknowledging their flea market competition was as much acknowledging reality as it was putting on a clever show.</p><p>Decade-trawling made easy was the message cheerfully announced on T-shirts that declared ""J'adore le Vintage."" For fall, the D&amp;G racks will be full of excellent rummage finds, starting with Victorian taffeta jackets and moving on through velvet Poiret-esque coats, thirties tea dresses, tweedy Joan Crawford tailoring, Chanel-esque plaids, Courrèges go-go boots, Loris Azzaro gowns, and even a slithery homage to Versace chain mail. Just as impressive, the show's styling was a convincing approximation of how the cool girls really pile all that on, teetering on seventies wedges one moment, funking up chiffon dresses with tracksuits and trainers the next.</p></div>"
31,fall,2004,f2004,daryl-k,"Let all those other thirtysomething New York indie designers rehash the ironic/retro/ladylike thing ad infinitum. Daryl Kerrigan is not about to start pinning rhinestone brooches to her boyfriend jackets; and as for retro, the farthest back she's ever looked was to a Sex Pistols gig at London's 100 Club, circa 1977.</p><p>In her second season after a 2-year hiatus, Kerrigan took a big step toward reclaiming her position as the official dresser of the downtown rock 'n' roll crowd. Like her rocker inspirations, Kerrigan knows short and sharp make the point better than long and laborious, so she kept her presentation trimmed to 16 looks. That served her well, letting the details of her slinky, ruched-and-tucked tops and well-tailored skinny pants shine forth. Of course, Kerrigan's version of punk is hardly thrift store; each rip and slit is artfully placed, and her leather jackets have never seen the back of a tour van. And she wasn't all about tough stuff, either; a few of the season's soft-and-pretty ideas made themselves felt via an abbreviated lingerie slipdress, supersized fur, and even—gasp!—a ribbon bound around a high-waisted velvet dress. Hey, even Sid had his soft side.</p></div>"
32,fall,2004,f2004,derek-lam,"Derek Lam is one of the most promising young talents on the New York scene, a position underscored by the list of partial sponsors for his sophomore runway presentation—Ecco Domani, <em>Vogue,</em> Swarovski, Shiseido, Maurice Villency, and Saga Furs each contributed to the cost of the show, in the august confines of New York’s National Arts Club. The investment turned out to be a sound one. Lam’s 24-piece collection displayed the attitude, exuberance, and craftsmanship of a much more experienced designer (which shouldn’t be that surprising, given the fact that he spent 12 years working for Michael Kors).</p><p>Lam’s fall mood was part Viennese formality, part Gypsy ease, and his strength as a mixologist came through in some superb pairings: luxurious cashmere boyfriend sweaters with shiny jacquard dresses, or a striped mink scarf worn with lamé brocade pajama shorts. The designer reprised the softly structured strapless dresses he had shown for spring, rendering them in glittery fabrics with jeweled embellishments, and balanced comfort and opulence in a floral-print vintage-silk georgette dress that flowed with every step. He also introduced softer, longer tea gowns and Empire-waisted peasant dresses. The final evening gowns were stunners that lifted even the Some Girls lyrics on the soundtrack—“You’re the prettiest girl in the world”—out of the realm of irony or cliché. Lam’s collection was relevant, contemporary, and genuinely very pretty, indeed.</p></div>"
33,fall,2004,f2004,diane-von-furstenberg,"The peripatetic Diane von Furstenberg never stays in one place, or one decade, too long. For spring, she flirted with flappers, but her fall collection was dedicated to a less era-specific icon: the glamazon (which also happens to be the name of the newest addition to her growing beauty line).</p><p>This modern-day huntress gathers her fashion as she pleases; not for her a dull adherence to one style or another. The collection, designed as always by von Furstenberg and Nathan Jenden, drew heavily from the English hunting lodge, with its tweeds and tartans—although it’s doubtful anyone ever rode to the hounds in one of von Furstenberg’s skintight cuts, curvy jackets, or eye-dazzling color combinations. The designers called on Camelot as well, with touches of medieval battle armor: a metallic knit tunic with an attached hood, a dark-gray snakeskin leather jacket, a jangly spangled beaded tabard worn over a wool jersey top and leggings. There’s so much going on that it can be hard to follow von Furstenberg’s lead, but there’s no doubt she enjoys the sport of it all.</p></div>"
34,fall,2004,f2004,dkny,"Secondary collections sometimes suffer from neglected-sibling treatment, making do with hand-me-down rejects from their bigger sisters. Thankfully, Donna Karan avoids that approach with DKNY, giving the label a personality (smart, snappy, a little bit trendy) all its own.</p><p>Fall's collection was one of DKNY's best yet, full of right-on colors, fabrics and proportions. The palette was classic fall—greens, browns and plums in tones that ranged from acid bright to muted—all the better to back up the collegiate-bohemian vibe. The show opened with a generously cut tweedy overcoat worn over a body-skimming kneelength jersey dress, and followed up with lots of examples of the new trouser shape—narrow, cropped just above the ankle and worn with bulky boots or chunky heeled pumps. There were cozy, bulky sweaters that sat on the hips, A-line skirts made from bias-cut strips of fabric or sunburst-pleated for a swingy flare, crisp boxy jackets and fragile chiffon dresses, pintucked and pleated to a fare-thee-well. The only points of crossover with Karan's signature line were the soft, wrinkly leathers she used in her spring collection, but they were welcome additions to the party.</p><p>She may cherish her own identity, but the DKNY girl is happy to raid mom's jewelry box for a big glittery brooch, or grandma's closet for a swinging, three-quarter sleeve coat that she'll wear over tweed trousers or a silky jersey dress. When it comes to nighttime, however, she's strictly modern, heading out the door in a a skin-baring, jewel-toned satin slipdress. Don't ask what time she'll be home.</p></div>"
35,fall,2004,f2004,dolce-gabbana,"After last season's print-on-print delirium, this collection—an ode to the iconic images of the late, very great photographer Helmut Newton—was a remarkably sober offering from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But in the hands of Domenico and Stefano, of course, sobriety is a relative concept; there was no shortage of razzle-dazzle and built-in wardrobe malfunction.</p><p>Like Newton in the seventies and eighties, the boys presented a woman who was ultra-chic, groomed, powerful—and ripe for sexual misadventure. Small wonder that pride of place in the audience was reserved for Fanny Ardant, the agelessly beautiful French actress and sometime Newton subject, striking in the designers' shapely white pencil-skirt power suit. Or that the amazonian Nadja Auermann, another Newton favorite, strode the runway, more svelte and dramatic than ever.</p><p>Many of Newton's strongest pictures from this period feature the clothes of Saint Laurent (that's Yves, not Tom, for those with fashion-history deficit disorder), and there were several explicit, if playful, homages to that Parisian master—from the deep-green boxy fox chubby to the prim-but-sexy chiffon-and-lace full-sleeved cocktail frocks to an evening parade of skinny satin or velvet tuxedo pantsuits with a flash of lacy camisole beneath. Perhaps—prior to any official pronouncement about Tom Ford's replacement chez Saint Laurent—Messrs. Dolce and Gabbana are auditioning for the role?</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""kzejp""></div></div><p>In the meantime, they are having plenty of fun in Milan, subverting old-fashioned elegance with their own brand of highly sexed style. Even in a season of luxe effects, their fox-cuffed short evening coat, solid with diamond and topaz crystal beading and fit for a latter-day Marlene Dietrich, was eye-poppingly glamorous. Inventive notions included simply chic sweaters and satin shell tops garlanded with trompe l'oeil embroidered necklaces, houndstooth skirts inset with godets of naughty black lace, and a formal black coat that flashed open to reveal a lingerie slip beneath. As the girls—including Elvis' angelic granddaughter Riley Keough, in demure black velvet—clustered on the orchid-pink leatherette banquettes of the Regine's-inspired disco set, one model sped past in a high-neck, long-sleeve black lace gown that looked conservative enough for Mrs. Bush. Until she turned her back, revealing the sheer, unlined lace back that flashed an emerald-green bra and panty set. Perfect for the next Super Bowl.</p></div>"
36,fall,2004,f2004,donna-karan,"A black cashmere bodysuit shown against a backdrop of the New York City skyline by night. That’s how Donna Karan opened her fall show, drawing a direct line from her first collection, 20 years ago, right up to the present. That scrap of jersey kick-started Karan’s empire and changed the way women thought about power dressing, while the energy of the city was refracted in her thoroughly modern clothes. Two decades later, she’s still guided by the same twin stars.</p><p>The designer replaced the heated sensuality of her spring collection with a moody remoteness, reinforced by the sober palette: plum, brown, rust, ocher yellow, and chartreuse. She played that out in soft cashmere and wool jerseys, silk tulle, burnt-out velvets, and wool bouclé, often topped with little twisted fur neckpieces. Snug jersey dresses were inventively wrapped and frequently anchored by glass buckles courtesy of jeweler William Morris. Karan’s sportswear, as always, looked light enough to float, while the raw seams and rugged leathers added a gloss of dark charm. Evening dresses incorporating suede, cashmere, and velvet seemed more suited to a salon than a soirée, but Karan’s gold-sequin and tulle gown could light up the night all by itself.</p></div>"
37,fall,2004,f2004,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten could never see a woman as a power vixen or a sex bomb. His natural affections have always tended toward the eclectic, eccentric, intellectual type whose mind has been broadened by travel. This woman likes gentle, layered, softly colored, unrestricting clothes, and—Van Noten has discovered—she has a surprising eye for the odd, richly sparkling accessory or two. She is, in fact, his customer, so it's hardly surprising to find the designer staying true to the arts-and-crafts, twenties-thirties sensibility that just so happens to be sweeping fashion right now.</p><p>This season, she is personified as a poetry-reading Bloomsbury aesthete with a passion for chinoiserie. She lives in dusty, washed-out colors—mushroom, plaster pink, aged greens—made up into loose twenties blouses, block-patterned jacquard coats, and tweedy cardigan knits. She has traveled, probably by air (which maybe accounts for her eccentric insistence on wearing Red Baron-esque leather flying trews). One of her adventures clearly took her to Somerset Maugham's Singapore, for she has returned with embroidered silk pajamas and richly embellished Chinese jackets as souvenirs. For afternoons in her study (writing her memoirs in purple ink, no doubt), she sits comfortably in silken dévoré-velvet kimonos to summon the muse.</p><p>But that's enough of that. What practical fashion fiends will note from this collection is Van Noten's way with a great decorative scarf—an accessory category he has made almost his own. For fall, it's transformed into a little fur neck-collar with a jewel-encrusted placket—an instant must-have, even if you're not a paid-up member of the eternal Van Noten sisterhood.</p></div>"
38,fall,2004,f2004,dsquared,"<em>The Simple Life</em>, Season 2: Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie in Calgary. If that pitch flies in Hollywood, Dsquared has the wardrobe prepped and ready to go. For their fall collection, the irrepressible Caten twins took Canada—their home and native land—and its icons as the starting point for a kitschy meander through rugged winterwear.</p><p>The theme was introduced by a matched set of brawny, red-jacketed Mounties and developed by the parade of woodsy, lumberjack-flavored pieces that followed—bulky wools in windowpane plaids, plush fox-fur-trimmed coats, lots of little sweaters. In fact, when in doubt, the Catens miniaturize, creating shrunken jackets, plaid kilts that elsewhere would be called belts, and variations on their famously very low-slung pants (this season cropped at midcalf and worn with high-heel work boots). It was cute, cheerful, and wholesomely trashy, if a little far from both the sweetly feminine and luxe bohemian looks that are filling other runways. Then again, the Caten brothers have never followed anyone's map but their own.</p></div>"
39,fall,2004,f2004,emanuel-ungaro,"There are times when a show is in progress and, suddenly, a question crops up: Just exactly which season are these clothes for? That particular thought crossed the mind while watching Giambattista Valli's latest efforts for the house of Ungaro. Valli, rather guilty in the past of loading his outfits with too many extras (fedoras and fur wraps and feathery fripperies), stripped back to nothing this season but for some fabulous Buccellati earrings and the occasional gem-studded satin bag.</p><p>But perhaps this stripping process went too far. What Valli showed on the runway flashed enough flesh to make even a spring collection seem skimpy, yet these looks are meant for fall. When the weather turns chilly, is a woman really going to reach for a tiered floral silk mini or a nude beaded chiffon dress? It's hypothermia on a hanger—not to mention out of sync with where fashion is now. As the recent Academy Awards made clear, blatant skin-baring is out, and seduction is turning more subtle. If Valli's efforts to simplify what he shows had included more of those curvy tweed jackets and leopard-print wrap coats that did make it onto the runway, he might have given this collection greater substance—in every sense of the word.</p></div>"
40,fall,2004,f2004,emilio-pucci,"Christian Lacroix relaxed into his element at Pucci for fall—meaning there was more of his signature, slightly wacky styling on show. That¿s a plus in a season when colorful, offbeat eclecticism is the flavor of the moment, and even more so given Lacroix¿s practiced skill with color and complex, floaty asymmetries destined for the party circuit.</p><p>To start, Lacroix veered off piste from Pucci¿s St. Moritz ski heritage, choosing instead to stick to city tweeds and sweaters. He Puccified those herringbone coats, neat jackets, and knickers by printing them with an adaptation of a late-sixties/early seventies archive design called Moire. The mix of fox-fur collars, suede platforms, and trilbies made for combinations few might copy verbatim, but that¿s OK. Modern shoppers trawl Pucci to cherry-pick items, and Lacroix laid on plenty of quirky amusements, from multi-patterned sweaters to odd, bright psychedelic hats to oversized satin totes.</p><p>Still, Lacroix seemed happiest when he lightened his palette and moved into evening. Adding silver Lurex to the pink, green, and turquoise prints, knotting flyaway scarf details, and applying spiderweb crochet, he made fragile little dresses that will be life-enhancing additions to winter¿s dark nights.</p></div>"
41,fall,2004,f2004,emporio-armani,"With a video of skyscrapers flickering behind them, Giorgio Armani's new Emporio women marched out. They're a far cry from his serious, be-suited, go-to-work army of old, though; they may be business types, but they're still in the mood to face the day feeling, well, considerably foxier than the average straight-laced corporate recruit.</p><p>Crimped hair, dangly earrings, and high heels were the ever-so-slightly trashy foil for Armani's signature softly-tailored coats, rounded in the shoulder and flared at the hem. Biker jackets in pony and mid-calf flippy skirts replaced his more familiar office-proper suitings. As the collection headed toward evening, a Spanish Gypsy element cropped up in head scarves and heavy tasselled fringe on stoles and knits. The show ended with a burst of song from a young woman performer, Yu Yu—a lead-in to the music-business party Armani was to throw later that evening at his nightclub. Though some of the design specifics of the collection didn't gel, Armani's message was clear: He's in a mood to lighten up and let his women look as if they want to live a little.</p></div>"
42,fall,2004,f2004,fendi,"Sitting in a freezing, inhospitable industrial space waiting for the Fendi show to begin, the huddled, goose-pimpled audience was craving a major fur moment in more ways than one. When Karl Lagerfeld's slick-haired futuristic amazons began to stalk out, bristling with armfuls of metal jewellery, the knitted furs they dragged behind them did have an enviable survival-blanket appeal. But these surprisingly restrained offerings were hardly the kind of explosively creative pieces expected from the house that rewrote the rule book on skins and pelts.</p><p>There were no obvious references for the tight, sometimes hobbling silhouettes and aggressively hard-edged look Lagerfeld created (except, perhaps, for a touch of the sci-fi movie <em>Gattaca</em>). His army of women teetered the 100-yard runway in round-toed wedges, brandishing the new Fendi bags like totems (one with a shiny metal handle reminiscent of a transistor radio's, another a jewelled and mirrored minaudière). To be fair, Lagerfeld should get some credit for taking an anti-vintage stance this season—somebody had to do it, after all. ""It was not about any past,"" he declared. ""Certainly not my own."" That said, his drive to modernism had a dispiriting joylessness about it. Luxe fashion like Fendi's, which speaks in the details of incredible craftsmanship, doesn't necessarily shine in such cold and impersonal surroundings.</p></div>"
43,fall,2004,f2004,giles-deacon,"Giles Deacon had the confidence to harness the best of British spirit with relish and wit. In his debut collection, called Giles, he managed to marry a slightly peculiar, uptight-seventies-lady look—all nipped-waist suits, pussycat-bow blouses, and flowing printed gowns—with homegrown English craft. Deacon, 34, graduated from Central St. Martin's ten years ago with Hussein Chalayan and has spent the intervening years freelancing, with stints at Bottega Veneta and Gucci. So why choose London as a launchpad? ""I live here. I love it,"" he said. ""There's such a lot going on here if you dig around.""</p><p>Deacon's international experience shows in the polish of his silhouettes—and in the roster of supermodels (Nadja Auermann and Eva Herzigova among them) who wore his precision-cut wide-shouldered jackets, pencil skirts, cashmere tank tops, and fan-pleated skirts. That, plus the deliberately chosen materials—hand-loomed bespoke jacquards, custom-made psychedelic woodland prints commissioned from the Glasgow School of Art, luxe Linton tweed from Scotland, and leather accessories, molded into the shape of stag beetles by artist-craftsman Justin Capp—gave the show what Deacon calls ""a slightly odd, misplaced chicness."" With its underlying thread of perversity (covered-up dresses that showed intriguing flashes of garter and seamed stockings) and just a hint of trippiness offsetting the very sensible, Deacon's collection put down a marker for a new English look.</p></div>"
44,fall,2004,f2004,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani has a new focus. ""Women want to be diverse, not to follow a standardized look,"" he said of his fall show. ""They want to be motivated by something special. That's why they've started looking for vintage pieces."" Inspired by what he called ""a vague feeling for the 1900s, and Visconti's film <em>The Damned</em>,"" he sent out a romantic assembly of looks designed to be remixed by the wearer, rather than imposed as top-to-toe solutions.</p><p>Armani drew a long, supple silhouette with dresses, coats, and jackets that were cut close to the body and gently fluted toward the hem. Standouts included laser-cut and printed velvet pieces, scalloped-edge lace jackets, beaded halter dresses, and crystal-encrusted evening jackets crafted as softly as blouses. Huge sparkling brooches underscored the air of decadent eccentricity that is fast becoming the look of the season. Among the rich, couturelike handwork that has long distinguished Armani's evening looks, he also sent out a selection of his luxurious signature streetwear in the form of ankle-skimming, vaguely Napoleonic coats.</p><p>In condensing this show to a 20-minute sampling of his vast collection, Armani embraced the eclecticism that is a ruling factor in fashion right now. It looked like a beautiful step forward.</p></div>"
45,fall,2004,f2004,givenchy,"The time has come to bid adieu to Julien Macdonald, who leaves Givenchy after three years. Macdonald has not had the easiest of times in Paris. His natural inclination, as demonstrated by his eponymous London-based label, is toward a spangly, none too subtle glamour that would satisfy even the most blatantly exhibitionist starlet. Macdonald spent his time at Givenchy desperately trying to free himself from its history, dominated by the understated chic that its founder created for Audrey Hepburn in the fifties: little black dresses that tapered toward the knees, cropped-sleeve coats that shrugged over straight skirts, and sweet but sober evening dresses with one indulgence: a strapless neckline, say, or a judiciously placed bow.</p><p>Having resisted the pull of the past this long, Macdonald finally gave in and used the house's roots as inspiration for his last big blowout at Givenchy. The problem was that none of it really worked. His mix of voluminous furs, belted coats over billowing pouf skirts, and fitted cocktail dresses with frothy lingerie flourishes has already been seen elsewhere this week—and in much more convincing forms. Still, if there's anything positive about all of this, it's that Macdonald is happy to be free to concentrate on his own label. That's if the size of his smile as he took the runway at the show's finale is anything to go by.</p></div>"
46,fall,2004,f2004,gucci,"The emotional ending of the Tom Ford era at Gucci was a look back in glamour—a fabulous farewell in which this perfection-obsessed superstar of fashion seized the moment to run his eye over everything he has achieved for the brand, and then do it better. There is no doubt who the Gucci woman is: the embodiment of sexual confidence, burnished to a high gloss and bursting with predatory power. A symbolic figure of the past decade's hedonistic highs, she spike-heeled her way down a runway carpeted with pink fur, luxuriating in Ford's aesthetic one last time.</p><p>And it has become elaborate of late. Even when he cuts a mean-looking black skirtsuit, it will be fanatically worked to the body, ruched to the ribs, and pieced in multiple complex slivers to grip the derriere. So too with the jackets, which have become ultra-decadent amalgams of dyed fox, croc, and suede, cut to emphasize a big shoulder and clinch the torso in bursts of sunray patchwork.</p><p>The buildup began as Ford took his audience through a knowing, celebratory series of flashbacks. There were the blue velvet jackets of his first 1995 hit, paired with nude beaded pants from a later blockbuster. A new manifestation of the 1999 sellout white coat with a knotted leather belt, its glamour amped to overload with an entire white fox snaking the shoulders. Variations on the crystal-sprinkled flesh-colored goddess gown famously worn by Nicole Kidman at the Met, even more beautifully realized than the original.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""m21yq7""></div></div><p>Ford outdid himself as well with event-making eveningwear. There were slithering sequined mermaid gowns, the ultimate done in a fantastically evil shade of green and wrapped in an arrogant fox-and-chiffon stole. But the emotional crescendo came from the white cutout jersey dresses that closed the show. A reprise of Ford's favorite collection of fall '96, they came more softly draped and subtly constructed than the originals. He bestowed the best on Georgina Grenville, making a nostalgic comeback appearance in her role as the ultimate high-nineties Gucci model. She looked overwhelmed at the thunderous applause that accompanied her final walk, the perfect signoff to the extraordinary drama of Ford's years at Gucci.</p></div>"
47,fall,2004,f2004,helmut-lang,"The long-limbed stride of Helmut Lang's tribe is a uniquely confident forward march. From their elegant coats to the tips of their high stalking heels, his women go out to meet the real world with a conviction that leaves retro in the dust. For starters, theyre prepared for the weather (a consideration strangely overlooked in many of this season's lady-crazed collections). His deep-dyed shearlings in saturated blues and purples, some chopped short into multi-flapped shrugs, others cut as lean raw-edged coats, made an instant, powerful impact. Pragmatism with a personal, cultured background: Now, thats a beautiful sight in these days of skimpy fashion thinking.</p><p>Lang didnt neglect to show that other item that's scarce on the ground this season: a mean-cut pair of the great skinny tux pants hes always done, now narrowed to meet high-cuffed drawstring suede or shearling ankle boots. If it's the perfect black trouser suit youre desperate for, hes your only man. And once daytime is dealt with, he has some of the most coolly brilliant options for evening, too—like a gorgeous, just-off-classic white satin trench and a shaggy cream goat-shearling coat belted with white satin. As sophisticated as these pieces are, they have an easy wearability that lifted this collection clear of the shredded, strap-manic complexity of some of Langs recent work.</p><p>When you buy into Lang's aesthetic, however, you're also complicit with his subtly coded subtexts. That could be the white lace edge on the brim of a thigh-high leather boot, under a short black dress with a suggestive frill of white petticoat. ""Sort of a bit like an Austrian waitress, no?"" the designer laughed, afterward. Langs Mittel European roots also account for the pleated organza twisted onto evening gowns—from Hungarian folk costume, he said, just as the shaggy cream coat started life as a notion about Hungarian shepherd jackets. But none of these references were overt. Lang is too mature, and too sure of his touch, to resort to a one-note ""inspiration,"" and this collection was as far from ""folkloric"" as imaginable. With its small details of delightfully irrational crazy-chic—like the pony-hair tail sprouting from the back of a pair of pumps—it qualified as a modernist high point of the season.</p></div>"
48,fall,2004,f2004,hermes,"Jean Paul Gaultier is the new designer in the Hermès stable—literally. He showed his debut collection for the ultimate French haute-horsey leather-goods house at the École Militaire cavalry training ground, where the audience sat on bales of hay, under crystal chandeliers. Now, in a serendipitous turn, equestrian just happens to have been trotted out as a trend this fall. So, in a happy case of Gaultier-esque double-think, he barely needed to give Hermès a fashion leg-up to make it sit easily with the season. And because Hermès is haughtily blinkered to ""fashion,"" anyway, this collection was set to keep everyone in the audience—from thoroughbred traditionalists to nervy trend-jockeys—smiling.</p><p>An elegant top-hatted riding habit opened the show, followed by a couple of suede ""jodhpur"" skirts that curved into the knee—an amusing acknowledgement of the bubble-skirt shape that's been turning up elsewhere. From there, Gaultier played on all the house classics—discreet gray cashmere cardigans(with detachable fur collars), the distinctive Hermès orange canvas (as a sporty jacket), navy pea coats (with the proportions chicly exaggerated), and luxe fringed scarves (draped to become coats).</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>He also made a typically witty JPG transposition by taking the iconic brass hardware of the Hermès handbag and using it as fastenings on a camel toggle coat, as details on gloves and boots, and even as padlocked chokers on leather-trimmed halter dresses. Persuading Lou Doillon to walk in a leather jacket, pants, and riding boots, swishing a crop, was another excellent twist on Hermès culture (because, of course, as the daughter of Jane Birkin, the girlis dynastically related to that iconic bag). Speaking of which—the Birkin turned up remodelled in an elongated version that is certain to make the legendary Hermès waiting lists even longer.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vg31gv""></div></div><p>There were moments in this collection when Gaultier's penchant for perversity made a discreet appearance among the bourgeois classics. For the sharp-eyed, the harness head-straps made a sly reference to the notorious <em>Paris Vogue</em> shoot by Helmut Newton that depicted an unusual deployment of Hermès saddlery in a hotel bedroom. For the most part, though, there was nothing to frighten the horses in this collection. Quality and conservatism won out, which is probably just as it should be, for the time being. How Gaultier sustains the interest over the coming seasons will be something to watch.</p></div>"
49,fall,2004,f2004,imitation-of-christ,"Tara Subkoff is a new woman. In an about-face from her retro-inspired spring collection, which celebrated the glamour of Old Hollywood, the designer presented a vintage-free fall knitwear collection to an artist-heavy crowd packed into the small 94th Street salon of independent curator Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn. A decent portion of the audience had actually had a hand in the production: Paula Hayes’s <em>Forest</em> installation formed the backdrop, while Rita Ackermann helped paint the meandering paper runway, strewn with white roses and magnolia leaves. Also in attendance were Jimmy Fallon, Sam Taylor-Wood, and a gaggle of under-fives that included Mingus Reedus, whose saucer-sized blue eyes followed his mom, Helena Christensen, as she walked.</p><p>Subkoff’s theme was a kind of extreme take on the strong woman: half goddess (but not of the drapey sort), half Amazon. That translated into microscopically short, body-loving knits, mostly rendered in black, white, and metallics, accessorized with Erickson Beamon cuff bracelets and knee-high gold Puma boots. This was a tightly focused show that marked a departure from Imitation of Christ’s established brand image. Though reworked vintage will continue to be available by special order, Subkoff, for now, seems focused on her own original designs. This takes her out of an increasingly crowded niche, but how well she can fare in a bigger, more competitive arena remains to be seen.</p></div>"
50,fall,2004,f2004,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel, the third-generation designer behind the beloved-of-socialites furrier J. Mendel, is a wizard with a pelt. That’s why his sporty designs are filling the closets of women who wouldn’t give mom’s mink a second look. In the past few seasons, Mendel has been adding in bits and pieces of made-to-order clothing to his seasonal presentations; for fall, he went all-out with a fashion show in the Bryant Park tents.</p><p>Mendel drew his inspiration from Anna Karenina, Tolstoy’s sensually beautiful, irresistible heroine. And there were certainly clothes fit for a czarina: figure-hugging silk dresses in pale colors, trimmed with dangling knotted cords; soft crinkly chiffon skirts that swirled around the knees; and tulle skirts that burst in pleats, all decked with plenty of Cartier diamonds. Mendel worked fur throughout, cutting flawlessly constructed lightweight coats and jackets from sheared mink and broadtail and putting fluffy fox shrugs over satin gowns. He even made a dramatic black dress from feathers and strips of mink; it was old-world luxe with a hip new attitude.</p></div>"
51,fall,2004,f2004,jean-paul-gaultier,"Remember those heady days of the very early nineties, when the supermodel reigned supreme? And how some designers were up in arms about how much it cost to get them out of bed? Well, if only they'd stumbled on the stunt that Jean Paul Gaultier dreamed up for his show: Dispense with the latter-day supes, the Darias and the Liyas and the Karolinas, and use marionettes instead. (Oh, and a few model friends whom you have turned to time and again to walk your runway.) Working from a gantry erected onto the catwalk, Gaultier's puppeteers twirled their subjects round, even getting them to strike a few couture-y poses. But once the novelty wore off, did these puppets really make for an adequate substitute? The best runway-strutters project the same kind of allure radiated by Gaultier's guest Catherine Deneuve. Balsa tends to run a very poor second.</p><p>More importantly, did the clothes tug at the heartstrings of the audience? It was inevitable that they would a little, given that they represented Gaultier's homage to his own greatest hits. In a season where coats and jackets are shaping up to be more desirable than they have been in years, the designer's canny, commercial collection featured some of the best from his past, which looked just as good now. Standouts? A heavy herringbone tweed coat swathed in fox fur; a swingy, drop-shouldered navy caban; and an aviator jacket that mixed up a few of Gaultier's favorite things—tough distressed leather, Aran knitwear, corset lacing. And if these looks worked on life-size puppets, just think what they'll do when they make it onto real women.</p></div>"
52,fall,2004,f2004,jeffrey-chow,"The second time out is always harder than the debut; there’s more attention, higher expectations, greater pressure to impress. In a short and sweet fall collection, Jeffrey Chow (one of this year’s Ecco Domani winners) managed to avoid most of the sophomore pitfalls, while further establishing his distinctive take on luxe sportswear.</p><p>Chow showed lots of classic tailoring in traditional fabrics: loose-fitting tweed jackets, gathered at the back into a high-waisted ruffle; flannel trousers cut both wide and skinny, with a slightly raised waist; slim herringbone pencil skirts. His tunic-length hand-knit cabled sweaters, worn over slim bronze pants or some of his soft dresses, mixed well with the boho-preppy feeling that’s running through many of the young-designer shows this week. And his structured satin dresses, paired with fur jackets and capes, had the charm of a debutante’s ball. Chow spent a bit too much time fussing with some of his jackets—inserting various fabrics in the sleeves or adding extraneous embroidery—but overall he showed long-term potential. This is a young designer to watch.</p></div>"
53,fall,2004,f2004,jil-sander,"Clearly refreshed by the 3-year hiatus that ended with her spring 2004 collection, Jil Sander delivered a fall show that cut through the mixed-up flavors of current fashion like a palate-cleansing sorbet. Her new contribution is a gentler, less conceptual approach that embraces the desire for prettiness as well as coolly cut streetwear.</p><p>Sander offered a confident, contemporary parallel to mainstream fashion's current ladylike agenda, showing amazingly cut pea jackets, lean pants, tweed princess coats, and A-line skirts. The effect was simple and sophisticated, thanks as always to the judicious manipulation of quietly luxurious fabric. Sander's customers have always trusted her to dispel the nightmare complications of getting dressed for a busy day and now they have an equally happy one-step solution for great eveningwear: Put on her strapless, understated cream dress and—sans jewellery, furs, accessories, or fuss—you will turn heads like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn in a room full of gussied-up matrons.</p><p>Sander's comeback is proving the true value of personal, meticulously evolved design skills to the integrity of a brand. There is a clear difference between what we see now (the infinite care taken to mold the seaming and frame the stand of a collar in a herringbone tweed coat, for instance) and the generalized merchandising drive that prevailed in her absence. There's nothing intellectual about it, either: Countless women will relate to the easy simplicity of pairing a sweater with a black fan-pleated skirt, with a flash of silver in the front, or running off to work in a neat white half-belted trench. Sander's loyal customers are already back in droves: With this collection they're likely to be joined by a younger generation, shopping shoulder to shoulder.</p></div>"
54,fall,2004,f2004,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart seems to have found a show format she's comfortable with and she stuck with it for fall, opening—as she did last season—with a well-tailored coat and closing with a bias-cut gown. Spring's emphasis on lingerie gave way to a lot of tweed, as well as a series of riding-style looks—tight jackets with a Victorian-Russian flavor, worn with cigarette-slim pants. Among the designer's signature vintage-inspired looks were a multitude of pretty dresses, like a tiered, silver lace piece worn by Luca Gadjus and several delicate chiffon dresses beaded in a simple starburst pattern.</p></div>"
55,fall,2004,f2004,john-galliano,"John Galliano cited ""romantic, poetic seafarers of the Yemeni tribe"" as the basis of his fall collection. Quite what they were doing tangled up with gigantic <em>Cold Mountain</em> crinolines and corsets exploding with ruffles we needn't question too closely; all this means is that we're off on another colorful trip into Galliano's psychedelic, ethnographic imagination.</p><p>The pileup of fun and spectacle started with the towering constructs on the girls' heads. Little bowlers teetered on top of arrangements that supported, variously, floral head scarves, huge coiled fake-hair plaits, fox tails, silver jewelery, and whole canteens of miniature pots and pans. All <em>that</em> mirrored what was going on in the clothes—an insane collision of piratical stripes, vivid gypsy florals, Galliano's signature newsprint chiffons, and knitted patchworks, accessorized with dangling Coke cans and empty plastic mineral-water bottles.</p><p>Galliano¿s shows make a mockery of solemn fashion reporting. He knows, and we know, that no one would ever wear a 12-foot-wide crinoline over a baggy pair of printed drawers with, perhaps, a pair of plastic carrier bags on the feet. He's not even suggesting it. Perhaps what he's saying with this crazy scavenger look is that most canny shoppers simply pick over current fashion to appropriate what they want to add to a lifetime's collection of personal treasures. He is not one to laboriously dictate what goes with what.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ag8ikn""></div></div><p>At any rate, this time, the visual mayhem didn't conceal the garments that will translate directly from runway to hanger. Tiny, form-fitting jackets were the news, some in rose-embroidered chamois leather, others cut as bugle-boy military spencers or as eighteenth-century corsets in shearling. Great knits were also nonchalantly thrown in—a cream cardigan with fluffy pom-poms here, a raspberry-striped long-sleeve polo shirt there. All that seemed missing from Galliano¿s regular menu were his fragile evening dresses, one of the foundations on which he has built his name.</p><p>One thing is certain: For all the provocation Galliano likes his presentations to stir up, the real surprise is how scrumptiously pretty it ends up looking in the store.</p></div>"
56,fall,2004,f2004,jonathan-saunders,"The kaleidoscope of British talent periodically shakes out brilliant print designers who can look at color and pattern in mind-bending new ways. The latest is Scottish-born Jonathan Saunders, so skilled in manipulating surface design that he engineers his patterns to flow over body contours.</p><p>Using hard-edged combinations of orange, gray, ochre, purple, black and white, his sharp-angled geometrics are interspersed with zig-zagging zones of herringbone pattern—like Art Deco processed by a cyber-brain. Saunders applied his patterns to a troupe of second-skin dresses and bodysuits that looked like a muted, psychedelic echo of the days of Thierry Mugler's glamazons. There was too much repetition, but the glam-rock mood was on target with a growing London trend.</p></div>"
57,fall,2004,f2004,junya-watanabe,"Perhaps only Junya Watanabe (or his mentor, Rei Kawakubo) could cut an Edwardian gown out of what looks like a black nylon sleeping bag—and call it ""classic."" But if you're tuned in to Watanabe's romantic, avant-garde wavelength, with prior knowledge of his body of work, the idea actually made a kind of sense— eventually. During the show, his deeply padded stole necklines evolved into Poiret-like wraps and then on into sweet renditions of utilitarian, down-filled jackets. Classic couture meets classic streetwear, if you will.</p><p>Watanabe also revisited his favorite personal classics—the tweed and denim he's worked to stellar effect in the past. He used micro-tweed in jackets with tiny accordion pleats circling sleeves and waist, and took the padding theme to the insides of a forties-style, turquoise and brown Donegal skirtsuit. His signature aged denims came cut into low-riding skirts and as a great pair of loose-fit jeans. Watanabe also developed this season's cape obsession, turning it into a fine layer of knitted lace, like a sophisticated version of a bed-jacket.</p><p>In the end, this was not one of those vintage Watanabe collections that set copyists off on a new path for seasons to come; but his inventive touch had a quiet appeal nonetheless.</p></div>"
58,fall,2004,f2004,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole’s fall collection was aimed squarely at the time-starved but fashion-loving modern woman who has minimal time to spend in front of her closet before dashing out the door.</p><p>Aiming for can’t-lose classics, Cole showed simple tailored sportswear like full-leg wool flannel trousers topped by fine gauge sweaters and neat, belted trenches; motorcycle-style jackets cut slim to the body with broad, dramatic lapels and worn over skinny pants; slim, knee-length skirts; and easy jersey dresses. As might be expected from a man who started out in footwear, there was lots of leather, worked into the clothes or done up on its own into long swinging coats, roomy bombers, over-the-knee boots, and big totes.</p><p>It wasn’t all dress-and-dash, though; Cole showed his charming side with Art Deco-detailed slips and bias-cut satin frocks, worn with fuzzy sweaters or one of those motorcycle jackets. Because even the hardest-working professional has to make time for nightlife, after all.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""z3azog""></div></div><p>—Janet Ozzard</p></div>"
59,fall,2004,f2004,lagerfeld-gallery,"Karl Lagerfeld has always been pretty adept at drawing on a wide range of disparate references to make one very satisfying collection. Such was the case with his fall show at Lagerfeld Gallery, where sports influences, menswear tailoring, and slinky chiffon eveningwear all mingled happily on the same runway.</p><p>Lagerfeld opened with a selection of sexy, sportif snow parkas and anoraks, which then morphed into masculine wool pantsuits, some featuring leather panels inlaid at the waist, worn with substantial-collared white cotton shirts. He also showed some great zippered jackets, cut close to the body from purple astrakhan or brown leather. Evening meant a series of slinky chiffon dresses, long and short, which came pleated and trimmed with leather. At the close of the show, Lagerfeld made another reference, this one inadvertent: He quick-stepped around the runway in a natty silver-gray suit that would have looked just as good on one of his models. The designer himself as inspiration? Now there's a source worth quoting.</p></div>"
60,fall,2004,f2004,lanvin,"Alber Elbaz has been putting an inordinate amount of thought into making his vision of glamorous dressing an easy, relevant proposition for modern women. The most striking example came midway through his show, when an elegant twisted loop in the back of a short black silk dress was unpinned to fall from the shoulder, transforming itself into a starkly simple train. Every woman in the audience got this immediately: Two fabulous dresses for the price of one.</p><p>There were other such devices, like a kind of draped silk apron that untied to leave a bare shift beneath, or a gray sheath that came with a couple of removable net layers. For day, there were vests that could be worn over or under coats, and detachable shirt collars and cuffs to pop into dresses according to mood and occasion.</p><p>More simply, Elbaz reprised some of the elements that have brought him a growing following (a wide age span of fans that includes both Kate Moss and Gretchen Leach, wife of the American ambassador to France, both sitting front row.) The collection featured his taffeta trenches, the satin ribbon details he's made his own, a slew of his signature dresses, and his much-copied use of jewelry. He pinned slightly antiqued crystal flower brooches on day dresses and popped shredded chiffon roses in buttonholes; evening saw a reprise of his sparkling ribbon-backed neckpieces, now grown into long multiple strands. Still, it was the simplest of his dress ideas that stood out as the most modern and provocative: a white satin tank dress, knotted up the side with bows, slipped under a glamorous cloud of tufty, gray-tipped fox.</p></div>"
61,fall,2004,f2004,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele has a delicate way of tearing leaves out of fashion history and lightly rewriting them for a new generation. For fall, he said, he was thinking of ""Balenciaga, Chanel, Vionnet. The beauty that once was, as an ideal—but we're in today."" Almost everyone is referencing the twentieth-century greats these days, either literally or at some crumpled remove, but Steele isn't one of the shredders. His version of fall's now-familiar equation—silky dresses, camisoles, little skirts, and furs—comes out with a meticulous finish.</p><p>Contriving to infuse a sense of chic into his collection, Steele also managed to sidestep the inherent pitfalls of both ladylike frumpery and saccharine girlishness that beset many designers who set off down the well-trodden retro road. Some of that came through his subtle way of mixing soft sorbet shades of the same color in the same outfit (a <em>bois de rose</em> angora cardigan with a flesh-pink skirt, say, or two mismatching tints of green), and resisting the temptations of over decoration. He also leavened the frilly fragility of the dressy look with a few cool yoke-backed coats and dresses taken from the book of Balenciaga. Simply styled with bead-encrusted satin pumps, the look had a certain abbreviated modernity that set it refreshingly apart from standard vintage rehash.</p></div>"
62,fall,2004,f2004,libertine,"“It was seamless!” said Cindy Greene, half of the design duo Libertine, shortly after the label’s debut runway show—a somewhat ironic statement coming from someone with a penchant for exposed seams and other deconstructive details. Established in 2001, Libertine is a collaboration with a twist: The New York-based Greene is separated by 3,000 miles from her partner, Johnson Hartig, who lives in Los Angeles. That hasn’t stopped them from developing a cult following for their one-of-a-kind, reconstructed vintage pieces, which work a feeling that Greene describes as about “nature, the macabre, and early Americana.”</p><p>The presentation, in the café attached to St. Bartholomew’s Church, attracted an audience—many members decked out in Libertine gear—that included Michael Stipe, Jimmy Fallon, Helena Christensen, Patti Hansen, and Monet Mazur. They gave an enthusiastic reception to the label’s quirky reworkings, like tweed pants printed with falling autumn leaves or a fifties beaded sweater embellished with ribbons, brooches, and a screen-printed skull. Kilts, trenches, capes, and dresses were equally transfigured via prints of eyes, dancing bears, bird heads, and even a portrait of Lincoln. At a time when polished prettiness is ruling the runways, Libertine’s strikingly individual pieces stand as a kind of fashion-world call to live free or die—and to look good either way.</p></div>"
63,fall,2004,f2004,london-roundup,"The city's fashion week is in a state of flux, as some designers decamp for more visible pastures, others cut back, and a (rare) few expand to the runway. Here's a look at some who still call London home.</p><p><strong>Hamish Morrow</strong> was a no-show this season, opting to present his technically complex collection—he likes to integrate high-tech concepts with traditional methods of making clothes—in a Paris showroom. For fall, he ran lengths of stretchy industrial cord through silk jersey to make dresses and tops which can be draped, ruched, and tightened by the wearer. Prints were derived from thermal imaging, which mapped the body to show clusters of color—swirling forms of purple, magenta, and green—at the stress points. As always, his knack is melding opulent, feminine surface effects onto sporty bases: One outstanding piece was a slick coat panelled in champagne sequins. Why the change in venue? ""It's a time when I felt it sensible to reorganize and concentrate on selling,"" he said.</p><p>Sometimes, London fashion is more about a scene than a show. Looked at in a crowd or at a party (and especially after a couple of drinks), the way Kate Moss and her crowd mishmash their clothes can seem a work of genius. Such is the milieu of <strong>FrostFrench</strong>'s Sadie Frost and Jemima French, who have wisely until now presented their cute bits-and-pieces collections in various faux-party settings. This season, however, the amateur charm evaporated when they put the clothes on the runway. The vaguely gypsy layerings of teeny skirts, smocks, denims, and hand-knits fell pretty flat—even with Moss beaming supportively from the front row.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""5przk9""></div></div><p><strong>Alice Temperley</strong> has won her place as London's girly-dressmaker-in-chief in the space of three short seasons, with her flapper-esque frocks, cute Cubist knits, and little coats fast gaining a following of young socials on both sides of the Atlantic. For fall, her references were plucked from the demimonde of fin de siècle Paris. Nothing too literally historical, of course—just a good excuse for Temperley's usual sprinkling of beads on tulle and silk.</p><p>Aaron Sharif and Sachiko Okada of <strong>Blaak</strong> want an international challenge, so they're showing across the Channel. ""London has been good to us, but we've reached the stage where we're not new any more, and we want to see how it is in Paris,"" they said at a walkthrough of the fall line. Named Blaakistan, the collection plays up their fusion of ethnic sensibilities (his parentage is Pakistani, hers Japanese; they live in London's East End), twisting inspiration from Central Asian textiles into brightly layered, punkish looks.</p></div>"
64,fall,2004,f2004,louis-vuitton,"From the moment 16-year-old Lily Cole, wearing a belted, fur-collared tartan coat, set her dainty high-heeled golden bootie onto the snow-covered runway, it was clear this was about to be one of Marc Jacobs¿ delicious Louis Vuitton blockbusters.</p><p>Making tartan and solid country fabrics young and sexy isn¿t easy—as all too many designers have proved this season. Jacobs clinched it, though—cutting plaid tight, on the cross, in tiny leg-o'-mutton puffed-sleeve blouses and making slim tweedy skirts explode into flirty, petticoated godets in the hem. On top, he would add girlish tippets (one in faux ermine) tied with a satin bow and accessorize, accessorize: There were velvet bags printed with the house monogram and trompe l'oeil hardware, furry purses, and a myriad shoe-temptations (high plaid spectators, patent stiletto ghillies, brocade ankle boots fastened with ribbon).</p><p>""Scotland, Tissot, a little Foujita,"" said Jacobs, reeling off his research references. To elaborate: His design team had taken a tour of the Highlands, circling Balmoral (Her Majesty the Queen's grand Scottish bolt-hole), then patched in the frothy French prettiness of James Tissot's bustles and lace. The work of Tsuguharu Foujita, a Japanese traditionalist painter who worked in Paris in the twenties, also got pinned to the inspiration boards, striking a cute note for Japan's legion of LV fans.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6p1hrm""></div></div><p>The Tissot prettiness—swagged tartan taffeta, bustle bows, lace-framed décollétes, frilled fur capelets—just prevented the collection from tipping over the Scottish border into a full-on Vivienne Westwood homage. (Though, since her retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is imminent, Jacobs is probably ahead of the curve in saluting her.) In fact, this show, so delightfully full of rich pickings, was dedicated to another design great who had a profound influence on Jacobs. Stephen Sprouse, the friend who collaborated on the famous Louis Vuitton graffiti bags, died this week, and Jacobs acknowledged his loss in a moving program note.</p></div>"
65,fall,2004,f2004,luca-luca,"Luca Orlandi said that the guiding spirit for his fall collection was Lara Croft, the danger-loving adventuress of <em>Tomb Raider</em> fame. And the slithery, revealing looks he sent out for fall certainly seem likely to land their wearer in precarious situations—which she’s clearly equipped to handle, of course.</p><p>This tough-but-sexy babe dresses primarily in black, although it’s anything but basic: shiny silk satin, fur-trimmed wool, and, naturally, lots of leather. The cut is scuba-suit tight (all the better for sliding out of tight squeezes) and accessorized with ruching, Swarovski crystals, bias ruffles, lacing, and fur. The accessory of choice? A teetery stiletto (which doubles handily as a weapon). Orlandi mixed in some neat wool coats and even a cozy bulky black sweater for days when his heroine is laying low, while the scattering of rose-petal pink dresses are perfect for those moments when a little old-fashioned femininity is called for. For evening, Orlandi sent out high-drama body-hugging gowns that a latter-day Lara will happily sport—especially if it’s on a red carpet.</p></div>"
66,fall,2004,f2004,luella,"Luella Bartley’s delightful fall collection was inspired by one of the most beloved English archetypes—the bohemian aristo who wears a cashmere sweater with Wellies, drives a Range Rover filled with muddy dogs, and can tell equally risqué personal anecdotes about the Rolling Stones and Henry VIII.</p><p>Bartley’s fall basics for this character (and all who would emulate her) include drainpipe jeans, cut tight right down to the ankle and worn with frilly voile blouses or a short, sporty navy car coat; little tweedy blazers that end at the top of the hip; and motorcycle jackets in black or pale lavender goatskin. That’s for mucking about in the stables (or roaming Portobello Road); for tea time, she goes a bit more feminine with indigo blue or acid-green sheer mini-caftans over tights or trousers. Popping up to town for a day calls for the jersey and suede cardigan over a neat little pencil skirt, worn with chunky high heels tied on with wide satin ribbons. She trucks this all around in one of Bartley’s ever-popular leather “Gisele” satchels, decorated with all sorts of whimsical stencils and leather charms. After all, noblesse oblige means never being seen carrying any old grotty handbag.</p></div>"
67,fall,2004,f2004,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Sometimes familiarity breeds <em>content</em>. Marc Jacobs’s secondary line is now well enough established that its retro stylings, shrunken fit, and resolutely seventies vibe no longer look remotely quirky. Quite the opposite: The label has become a reliably hip commercial success. As if to confirm this comfortable status, Jacobs himself seems to have lost any vestige of pre-show jitters; he spent the last few minutes before the lights went down strolling the runway, posing for photos, and chatting with friends.</p><p>Against a soundtrack of Dinosaur Jr. and the Pixies, Jacobs showed the sweeter side of fall. He used soft fabrics like pinwale corduroy, moleskin, mohair, fluttery silk, cotton jersey, and even a bit of fur, in a color palette that was calm and muted: pale blues, greens, yellows, and creams, mixed with mocha, tan, navy, and black. He threw in a few printed blouses and some fuzzy sweaters, plus lots of the pea coats, T-shirts, and denim pieces that have become staples of the line. But the real fun comes in watching him balance the mix: a white T-shirt under a blue printed blouse, under a brown silk dress; a ruffled black velvet dress over a blue-striped sweater. While only a few of his customers can pull off that kind of eclectic styling, they all know that if they’re looking for just one cool piece to freshen up their whole closet, Marc can likely provide it.</p></div>"
68,fall,2004,f2004,marc-jacobs,"Sending Gisele Bündchen out to open and close your show is not the gesture of someone who shies from the spotlight. Coming from Marc Jacobs, it seemed a declaration of a new direction: After spending the first ten years at his own label as the indie/artsy crowd's favorite designer, he’s itching to move over into the multimillion-dollar mainstream. And why not? If knockoffs are the opinion polls of fashion, he’s won by a landslide, season after season.</p><p>Adept as he is at reading his customer's mind, Jacobs knows she doesn't take well to dictates; her closet is her playground. For spring, she's got a proper/naughty thing going on: sort of <em>Mona Lisa Smile</em> meets <em>Secretary</em>. (Wait, isn't that Maggie Gyllenhaal in the front row?) The proper showed up as elegant fit-and-flare tweed skirts, printed and pin-tucked silk blouses, lace-covered dresses, and great tweedy coats with just-so mink collars, all in superb fabrics and whispery soft colors like cream, mint, turquoise, and icy blue. And the naughty? That would be the earsplitting Distillers soundtrack, the saucy plunge necklines, and the teetering Vargas Girl pumps that gave the models' runway walks a hip-swiveling come-hither attitude. Jacobs' eveningwear gets more sophisticated each season, and this time he recalled Hollywood at its height; his gowns were tumbling cascades of chiffon or charmeuse in jewel tones that polished off the show, literally.</p></div>"
69,fall,2004,f2004,marni,"The typically dreamy, barefoot-in-the-kitchen Marni woman has become increasingly chic over the past few seasons. For winter, she's done her hair in a cool rockabilly quiff, donned high-heeled pumps and a fur shrug, and apparently purloined pieces from her man's wardrobe to go with her own favorite vintagey finds. ""I felt it was time to be a little more grown-up,"" designer Consuelo Castiglioni said, ""and to have a certain luxe, but without ostentation.""</p><p>Castiglioni did ""eccentric"" years before the fashion community began to use it as a term of approval. So, it was interesting to watch her clean up her silhouette, cinching waists with corseted obis, and calm her colors to classic beige, gray, navy, and bottle green. If that sounds a little dull, it didn't play that way. While the gray flannel trousers and fine-gauge sweaters looked new, there were also quietly confident renditions of all the things—three-quarter-sleeve coats, romantic prints, chiffon dresses—that the label's followers love to collect.</p><p>Most interesting, though, is the turnaround in the look of Marni's furs. The house started out with a mission to change perceptions about fur by creating playfully irreverent, undone patchworks and shapes that would look like completely different animals from the things Mom used to wear. Now—lo and behold—fashion has gone full circle. Marni's fall furs look almost exactly like softer renditions of fifties and sixties shrugs, boleros, and capes—and are all the more irresistible for it.</p></div>"
70,fall,2004,f2004,martin-grant,"Free advice to off-schedule designers who want to get an overextended, appointment-crazed Paris audience on their side: Start on time and get it over with quickly. Slapped wrists to Martin Grant for breaking the code, thereby filling the room with irritation before he'd even started. As a civilian lady invitee whispered, after looking at watch for the fifteenth time, ""Is this normal?""</p><p>Part of the charm of the grown-up, well-considered clothes Martin Grant designs from his workshop in the Marais is the small-scale immediacy of what he does. His followers expect an elegant seasonal shortcut into the kind of classic style that looks youthful (but rich) at any age. Some of that came over in his signature coats, done just so in a single-breasted pony version trimmed with leather, a narrow-waisted black Lurex evening trench, or three-quarter-length fifties tweed. This season, though, a heavy-sense-of-fashion theme made the magic evaporate.</p><p>Grant started with a belted cape-dress, proceeded to a coat-dress with capelet shoulders and a black-and-white tweed trench with the same cut, and followed that with tight black-and-pink brocade tweed cocktail dresses with a light hint of Suzie Wong. (Grant explained he'd been watching ""old Japanese gangster movies and Marlene Dietrich in <em>Shanghai Express</em>."") But all the lightness and color Grant captured in his last collection, and which fashion is craving this season, somehow eluded him. As a matter of fact, he isn't a designer who suffers from pretentiousness, but the couturelike surroundings he chose and the agonizing repetitiousness of this show almost made it seem so.</p></div>"
71,fall,2004,f2004,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon and her art director partner, Marc Ascoli (the man who has worked on advertising campaigns for everyone from Jil Sander to Yohji Yamamoto), are one of the boldface fashion couples of the City of Light. Naturally, their show often attracts the hipper, artier elements of Parisian society: If there isn't a groovy little contingent of women who look like Jane Birkin circa <em>Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus</em> and men with scruffy hair and (deliberately) scruffier suits, then something is amiss.</p><p>But it's not just Sitbon's status that draws the crowds: Her collections lure them in, too. She has perfected, over the past few seasons, a move away from her stark, severe look to something that's much easier—a kind of dreamy romanticism shot through with a street-cred sports vibe. She's also demonstrated an original way with color: This fall¿s combinations, as evinced by the paneled velvet and silk dresses that closed the show, might include mushroom, cream, scarlet, and sapphire blue.</p><p>The best of the bunch were the thirties dance dresses that looked like they could have stepped out of a Brassai photograph—all layers of pearl pink or creamy white chiffon, undulating hems, fluttery sleeves, and intriguing decoration. One had a gently quilted bib front and cap sleeves. There were also some fine cable knits—a slow-burner trend in Paris—here used for short fitted sweaters that had sleeves like tiny shrugs. Some of the tailoring, however, didn¿t make the grade, partly because the idea of reversing jackets and coats so that the linings show is never wise, partly because the cut was so ungainly it committed the cardinal sin of making the models look dumpy. The next time Sitbon shows, it will be those chiffon dresses that grace her front row.</p></div>"
72,fall,2004,f2004,max-mara,"Who thinks about the working woman these days? That¿s a down-to-earth question that doesn¿t appear to blip across many designers¿ radar screens in the twenty-first century, at least not when they¿re lining up runway parades for the press. MaxMara, on the other hand, is one of the few solid supporters of the belief that a woman in winter may (at the least) need a good coat in order to get through the humdrum A to B. This season, as it happens, a savvy style choice could well be an updated camel-hair classic. MaxMara has been in that business since the fifties, and this season's show revolved around its iconic belted coat, along with other aspects of town-and-country outerwear. There were small Norfolk jackets and shearling aviators that seemed nicely on-trend yet not limited to the category of one-season-only fashion statements.</p><p>The problem comes in fleshing out that pragmatic core as a fully realized collection. Yes, big flaring skirts are part of the current scene but they don¿t necessarily do much for the hips in blanket-weight fabrics. Ditto cable knits and Swarovski crystal when married into the same sweater. MaxMara can also stretch its credibility by feeling the need to show eveningwear. This season, the design team picked out the crystal-encrusted jersey keyhole disco gowns of the late seventies designer Loris Azzaro as a trendy reference du jour. Fine, but it¿s still those elegant coats that will keep the MaxMara woman coming back for more.</p></div>"

He spent five years as the head of Jil Sander’s design team, launched Burberry’s apparel collection and designed it for three years, and put in a season at Cerruti.</p><p>“We were thinking, What are the needs of this new generation?” said Menichetti, at the low-key presentation of his new signature label. “They live in a world that’s more of the senses, and less of the mind.” Refining that vision over almost two years, Menichetti, a minimalist at heart, has pared things down as much as possible. “No jeans line, no secondary line,” he explained. “You have everything here. A simple sweatshirt, next to a T-shirt, next to a cashmere sweater. This is how people dress now. It’s all about versatility.” It’s also about clean lines, luxurious Italian fabrics, and a simple mix-and-match palette of white, black, khaki, indigo blue, and pink. Now that he’s back behind the wheel, Menichetti is raring to go: His 5-year plan includes footwear, fragrance, even home. Stay tuned.</p></div>"
74,fall,2004,f2004,michael-kors-collection,"Bursting with confidence: That could describe Michael Kors’s ideal woman, his fall show or, these days, the designer himself. In the past year, Kors has been on a business-building rampage. He sold his company, tripled his staff, moved into a mammoth new office space, and introduced a lower-priced line with multimillion-dollar ambitions.</p><p>The collection was rooted in Kors’s favorite luxe materials (cashmere, fluttery silks, fine-gauge knits, suede, and lots and lots of fur) and strong tailoring. As expected, there were classics aplenty—suede jeans, an Aran-knit tank top, dramatic sweeping coats, and perfect little sweaters. But there was also a new friskiness on the runway. Kors jettisoned his usual neutrals for juicy colors like lavender, light blue, coral, and chocolate, and mixed in lots of pieces that require a certain youthful bravura (not to mention great legs) to pull off: fringed suede minis, slippery silk blouses, and clingy jersey dresses with rippling knee-length skirts. He piled on the accessories, too, topping the outfits with hefty belts, tooled-leather bags, floppy felt hats, or a knitted mink scarf in a spun-sugar color. In this kind of mood, Kors certainly isn’t feeling like an early-to-bed guy; he closed the show with a handful of high-glamour evening gowns, including one bronze beaded showstopper that glowed like a bright new day.</p></div>"
75,fall,2004,f2004,missoni,"Last season, the house of Missoni celebrated its golden jubilee with a spectacular parade of outfits representing 50 years of vibrant creativity. For fall, Angela Missoni, who has inherited the mantle of many colors from her parents, company founders Tai and Rosita, had clearly been inspired by that rich summation.</p><p>In a season dominated by the eclecticism and luxe bohemianism that is the house signature, Missoni evoked both ladylike Camelot elegance—Lurex-knit sheath dresses complete with velvet clutch purses and upswept hairdos—and the hippie looks that first put the label on the map in the early seventies: swirling Art Nouveau prints, knit capes, fringing, and chiffon palazzo pajamas. Capes were a strong theme, from the short zigzag-knit number in Neapolitan ice cream colors that opened the show (over short shorts) through the chiffon minidress with a floor-length fringed cape in back. Giant silk cabbage roses worn on chokers at the neck or pinned to the hip were a pretty touch (and ready for a Sarah Moon close-up), although knee socks worn with the high-heeled court shoes were definitely not.</p><p>Missoni's stylish furs cleverly referenced the house's trademark knits, as horizontally banded mink or fox coats were subtly graduated from collar to hem in tones from black to white or arctic to red, respectively. Organic, Lava Lamp appliqué details recalled the wacky spage-age looks of Pierre Cardin, currently the subject of a retrospective at Carla Sozzani's Corso Como gallery. With true pan-generational appeal, the show included pieces suitable for Rosita Missoni, as well as looks that were perfect for her granddaughter, It girl Margherita.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qdvey""></div></div><p>Dramatic evening gowns in colored Lurex or vibrant kaleidoscope prints, suspended from jeweled halters, suggested Sharon Stone¿s va-va-voom wardrobe in <em>Casino</em>, while a fringed knit dress looked as though the model had wrapped herself in a gypsy shawl—a dramatic gesture worthy of the Belle Époque dancer Loie Fuller, actress Eleonora Duse, or society beauty Consuelo Vanderbilt, all of whom Missoni cited as influences.</p></div>"
76,fall,2004,f2004,miu-miu,"The Miu Miu label is ideal for those times when we feel like scanning the stores for an inexpensive simulacrum of a designer look—as in, every other Saturday, minimum. And when fall rolls around, and we are seized by the urgent need for a long plain boyish V-neck cardigan, or something tweedy and vintagey with a sparkly detail and a scrap-of-fur collar, or a dress with a semi-destroyed sexual allure, Miu Miu will be right there with the goods.</p><p>That's hardly surprising, because it was Miuccia Prada who invented, or reinvented, this look in the first place. Not that Miu Miu is an ersatz replica of Prada (leave that to the copyists). In this collection, she added original extras, like beat-up washed-leather jackets, long-line maxi coats, slim calf-length dresses, and skirts reminiscent of early seventies Ossie Clark. Beaded, jewelled details were applied to the oversize buttons on tweed coats and small forties-styled jackets, the edges of inverted pleats on skirts, and the toes of dainty brocade pumps. All of this was held together by a magically subtle color sense—chestnut, mousy browns, grays, maroons, and dull flashes of bronze, copper, antique gold, and green.</p><p>While some of the signature, crinkled lining-silk dresses looked irresistible, others—especially the sheer printed frocks—presented a what-do-I-do-with-this challenge. Ninety-nine percent of this collection, though, was totally liveable, mixable fashion—testament to Miuccia Prada's commercial intelligence, as well as her storied talent.</p></div>"
77,fall,2004,f2004,monique-lhuillier,"Despite her very French name, Monique Lhuillier is a West Coast-based designer who started out in bridal before showing her first ready-to-wear collection in 2003. Her dresses have been appearing with increasing frequency on the red carpet, but, as her fall show demonstrated, Lhuillier knows how to appeal to a demographic beyond just celebrities.</p><p>Trading in the flirty florals she favored for spring, the designer mixed a little bit of naughty in with the nice. Delicate corsets peeked out from under cashmere cardigans and Chanel-y ribbon-trimmed tweed jackets, while a chocolate velvet tuxedo had a sexy, sophisticated edge. Not all her silhouettes worked. Sleek, super-narrow looks (exemplified by a double-crepe suit and a lovely A-line dress with lilac cummerbund) shared the stage with full-skirted and ruffled pieces that were more prom than cocktail. The real stars of the collection were Lhuillier's coats: Her bronze lamé trench and fox-trimmed embroidered overcoat would catch the eye of any paparazzo.</p></div>"
78,fall,2004,f2004,moschino,"The jaunty little creature who pops up on Moschino's runway every season doesn't distress herself over the subtext of her clothes. No retro irony for her; she's more interested in the best opportunities to look cute. This season, of course, the young-lady-in-the-fifties look will suit her purposes to a T.</p><p>From the little wired ribbon-and-velvet hair ornaments to the Betty Boop pumps, Moschino's young woman has that down pat. There was a matchy-matchy moment, played with a silver-threaded tweed suit with a fluffy white Peter Pan fur collar worn with a swinging bag in the same fabric. The show ran on at length, through Chanel-inspired tweeds, tiered skirts perked out with tulle petticoats, and any number of flirtatious printed afternoon dresses. For all its cheeriness, though, a heavy air of inevitability is beginning to hang over collections like this. Moschino will be heaving with sweet, no-brainer, period pieces for fall—like so many others who have taken an obvious cue from Miuccia Prada, but skipped the intellectual thought process that puts her leagues ahead.</p></div>"
79,fall,2004,f2004,narciso-rodriguez,"It’s not by chance that Narciso Rodriguez calls his meticulous jackets and dresses “constructed.” They’re cut, shaped, and sewn with a relentless attention to detail that might have made Mies van der Rohe reconsider his calling. But for fall, Rodriguez’s chilled-to-perfection, skintight dresses and suits got a bit warmer with the help of plush fabrics, a sprinkling of fluffy fur, and even (gasp) some ruffles.</p><p>Never fear, Rodriguez followers: His signature body-hugging designs in monastic black or cream are still clearly the engine that drives the line and delights his front row (which included Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, and Claire Danes). But there’s a new sensuousness working its way into the intellectual exercise: Electric-blue piping streaks around the torso of a black dress; satin ribbon hugs the curves of a black pencil skirt; cozy little shrugs come in ballet-pink cashmere or a pouf of black shearling.</p><p>While he showed a few slim trousers, Rodriguez loves skirts and dresses, and that’s where he really cut loose. Alongside his beloved pencil, there were flippy gored styles, ruffly satin cha-cha looks, and some lovely A-line pieces packed with rows of tiny lace ruffles. For evening, he twisted yards of sheer ribbon around the torsos of satin-skirted gowns; just the right wrapping for his smart, cool customers.</p></div>"
80,fall,2004,f2004,nina-ricci,"The current spate of designer departures from European houses has taught the fashion world a very important lesson: Know thy customer. Tom Ford at Gucci knew exactly what kind of woman he was dressing and succeeded. Julien Macdonald at Givenchy clearly didn't and failed. Does Lars Nilsson know who the Nina Ricci woman is? He certainly has the talent to rise to the occasion but he is also clearly still fine-tuning the answer to that question.</p><p>He isn't helped in this elusive search by the label's total lack of identity. Unlike those other moribund houses that have been given the kiss of life (with varying degrees of success), Nina Ricci, the fragrance aside, means absolutely nada. It had no defining moment in its past; it has no design icon that can be reworked for a modern audience; and, while it's French, it doesn't resonate with the kind of magical chic that some Parisian houses do.</p><p>These are not, of course, problems of Nilsson's making, but they add to the challenges he faces. Oddly, he seemed far surer of where to take the house last spring, when he showed a fine, focused color palette of brown, blue, yellow, and orange and a sophisticated mix of sharp suits, soft dresses, and sweet lingerie. This collection felt more muddled in its approach. Given Nilsson's strengths with color and decoration, it was inevitable that he would be drawn to the vintagey, just-pulled-it-out-of-my-closet, highly personal feel that is driving the season. The ruffled tweed jacket and cropped pants that opened the show worked, as did the billowing silk blouses; the tulle-veiled dresses worn with sparkly shawls didn't. And the cumbersome triangular shrugs were just odd from a designer who never normally does tricky. Perhaps next season will prove that old adage: Third time's a charm.</p></div>"
81,fall,2004,f2004,oscar-de-la-renta,"Fabulous handiwork; rich, spicy colors; shapes cut to flatter. These are Oscar de la Renta’s calling cards, and his socialite-packed front row is testament to the designer’s mastery of the opulent-meets-elegant genre.</p><p>For fall, de la Renta played up the curves, showing hip-hugging pencil skirts and bias-cut A-line shapes that undulated beneath slim, snug jackets or lush cashmere sweaters. Tweed is the fabric of choice this season, but de la Renta never let his fabrics get too heavy; a neatly cut, nubby grey dress ended in a waft of flirty fluff at the hem, while a brown flared skirt got a lift from a spray of guinea hen feathers. De la Renta also loves a fur trim and he worked sable, shearling, mink, and lamb into places both expected (collars, cuffs, vests, and coats) and otherwise (the edge of a skirt).</p><p>De la Renta’s evening looks, all garnished with Fred Leighton jewels, hit a series of luxurious highs. A Balenciaga-esque cascade of satin poured down the back of a strict, fitted satin sheath, while a dramatic black-tulle bustier was paired with a swinging beaded skirt. And for those with a fairy-tale ball in their future, any of the designer’s star-spangled tulle gowns will be just the ticket.</p></div>"
82,fall,2004,f2004,perry-ellis,"Aside from snapping cameras and chattering editors, the only sound to be heard at the Perry Ellis show was that of a nail being hit squarely on its head. In his pitch-perfect second collection for the label, Patrick Robinson captured the season’s pretty, eccentric femininity with just the right dose of color, wit, and lightness.</p><p>As with his spring show, Robinson staged the collection as a walk-through, posing models in a tableau that allowed the audience to examine at leisure. There were nostalgic references to decades past in the loose coats and trim pencil skirts done up in camel hair or tweed, the cardigans with jeweled buttons, the A-line skirts in pastel colors, and the vintage brooches that glittered on almost every lapel—not to mention the models’ twisted updos and rosebud lips. But the mix also included some very modern, city girl-tough pieces like a slouchy trouser suit, a pale pink satin puffa, and a nifty fake-fur vest worn over a slim green jacket. Perry Ellis made his name with just that kind of finely observed, slouchy chic, and it’s now quite clear how well Robinson understands the spirit of the venerable house.</p></div>"
83,fall,2004,f2004,peter-som,"Peter Som’s fall inspiration was a giddily off-the-beam aristocrat of the <em>Grey Gardens</em> genre: the kind of woman who piles a big gold heirloom brooch (or three) on her unraveling tweed and pulls herself together with the help of a thin alligator belt (and maybe a midmorning martini). It was a great starting point for a lighthearted, swinging collection that touched on the season’s emerging trends with Som’s usual charm.</p><p>Som poured on the colors. He mixed apple green, chocolate brown, and lilac in the first outfit alone and then added in pale blue, deep plum, taupey pink, and navy. His fabrics had plenty of texture to play with, as well. There were the season’s darlings, tweed and chiffon, in addition to soft cashmere knits, moiré taffeta, wool gabardine, tulle, a vine-printed silk twill, and heavy duchesse satin, all decked with fox, sheared mink, and plenty of gleaming Verdura pins. He kept the silhouette ladylike but not fusty: There were pencil skirts, boxy jackets, sheath dresses, elegant collarless coats, and great low-slung trousers, worn with Alexandra Neel’s sexy, strappy stilettos. As his socialite-packed front row attests, Som is a dab hand at the special-event wardrobe. This time, he showed a lovely fluid black charmeuse camisole with the skirt covered in fluttering chiffon leaves, an elegant black silk moiré sheath with a deep-plunging back, and a pink-chiffon beaded confection that will tickle the fancy of bluebloods far and wide.</p></div>"
84,fall,2004,f2004,phi,"It's rare for a debut to be as slick and sophisticated as that of Phi, a sportswear company that showed its first collection in a mammoth, sun-drenched Chelsea industrial space on the last afternoon of Fashion Week. But Phi (pronounced ""fee"") is funded by Susan Dell, the very deep-pocketed wife of billionaire computer entrepreneur Michael Dell, so production values were in the money-is-no-object realm (up there, where Guido Palau is your go-to hair guy).</p><p>The collection's creative director is Tim Gardner, a former Calvin Klein-Jil Sander designer, and his loyalty to that school of luxe minimalism came through in the limited palette of black, wine, cream, and brown, and in the attention he lavished on utilitarian pieces like beautifully cut motorcycle jackets in leather or tweed, smart trenches, elegant long coats, and safari jackets. He played delicate off rough with fluttery dresses made from raw-edged silks worn with stompin' high-heeled motorcycle boots and detailed his pieces with silver D-rings and bits of sheer fabric. Bulky black knits got a bit heavy with walls of hanging fringe, though. Phi may be funded by a wealthy woman, but it's clearly no vanity project; this was a complete, thought-out collection filled with great pieces to make its front row—including the professionally glamorous Diane Sawyer—very happy.</p></div>"
85,fall,2004,f2004,pierrot,"Pierre Carrilero loves to spin a tale as much as a piece of yarn, and his Pierrot shows are always encased in some clever, cracked conceit: fairy tales, seaside frolics, triple-X filmmaking. It's a wise move on his part. His knitwear may have charm to spare, but he's still working in a very limited genre. For fall, the designer took a far more traditional route, making his show resemble the old French salon presentations, with running commentary on each outfit and models mincing demurely down the runway (to the far-out accompaniment of a theremin).</p><p>Carrilero has been doing slightly twisted, retro femininity for years, so his lacy, sex-addled pointelle knits and tiny flouncy skirts fit right into this fall's growing taste for the look. Ditto his bulky yarns, worked into cozy snug sweaters with various <em>très francais</em> intarsia designs (Eiffel Tower, poodles, etc.) worn over slim pencil skirts. His color choices got a bit loud at times, and skintight leggings are rarely flattering, but a Pierrot show always leaves its audience with a smile on its face—not to mention a yen for a few new sweaters.</p></div>"
86,fall,2004,f2004,pollini,"Rifat Ozbek, the Turkish-born designer who first made his name in London in the eighties, stepped back onto the runway with a show of 27 looks for the Italian footwear company Pollini. ""It's modern, exotic, Tibetan!"" he said of a collection conceived as a brief introductory statement of intent for the new line.</p><p>Melding ethnic influences to contemporary shapes has always been Ozbek's thing. He brought together digitalized jewel prints, tiger stripes, brocades, double-faced felts, and herringbone tweed into a tight collection aimed to appeal to the city woman's inner hippie. Standouts were neat coats in ivory or rust wool, implanted with Himalayan embroideries, and the coin-decorated leather boots with low heels picked out in color. Backstage, his loyal fan base cheered Ozbek's promising return to the scene.</p></div>"
87,fall,2004,f2004,prada,"Audiences always arrive at Prada shows tingling with anticipation, braced for Miuccia Prada's next departure from the last season¿s plot. This time, she confounded expectation again, not by taking off in a new direction, but by developing the cache of ideas layered into her spring collection. That, of course, was famously about the fifties lady tourist, with an overlay of hippie-ish tie-dye among the circle skirts and knits. For winter, she took that same woman into new realms of intellectual exploration on the print front: back to the future, in fact.</p><p>""It was a dream of extreme romanticism,"" she said. ""The idea of eighteenth-century painting, with video games. A romanticism between past and future."" The cyber fantasy came in computer-generated prints on her signature big, puffy skirts and the odd quirky robot appliqué on gray T-shirts. Yet none of that seemed jarringly obtrusive in a collection that concentrated again on the in-and-out silhouette she established last season. For colder months, she¿s added more layers, adding in dip-dyed cable knits and buttonless cardigans betwixt tweeds and bejeweled fifties-style couture-like pieces. What held it all together, literally, were the cinched waists, circled in narrow grosgrain ribbon or with tie-on belts encrusted with sparkle.</p><p>It was that idea of jeweling, on collars, belts, and fabric brooches, that added the news. In a brilliant leap, she transposed those crunchy patches of decoration onto fitted down jackets—a perfect conflation of old-world luxury with classic Prada techno fabric that stood as the symbol of the entire collection.</p></div>"
88,fall,2004,f2004,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton are generally thought of as gritty Portobello deconstructionists, so it might come as a surprise to find them quoting that classic of French-movie style, <em>Belle de Jour</em>, as the inspiration for Preen' s fall season. Still, even though it's probably the most clichéd fashion reference of all time, the designers applied the haute bourgeois aesthetic in their own way, and it put a refreshingly polished accent on their usual streetwise repertoire.</p><p>The jolt of sophistication began with a long, high-belted, skinny camel coat with a pointy standing collar, followed by a pair of smart beige trousers and a matching cashmere sweater. The designers gently advanced that calm sense of normality by piecing fragments of shearling into other asymmetric camel coats or by fusing tweed into lapels. Their signature jerseys (descended from sweatshirts, somewhere along the way) appeared as flared, slinky dresses, falling below the knee and sprouting bits of rib-knit in odd places. For evening, there were bunchy baby dolls, whose tiered frills were assembled from cutoff shirt collars. Though their neat, to the body aviator shearlings came over as too near Balenciaga to be completely original, for the most part, this collection earned Preen new respect as designers who are gaining real maturity.</p></div>"
89,fall,2004,f2004,proenza-schouler,"No more Mr. Nice Guys: For their Bryant Park debut, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez forsook the sweet all-American girl who had inspired their spring show in favor of a woman straight out of a Helmut Newton portrait: intense, sexy, strong. They dressed her in pants that were seamed, lashed, and tied, and sent her stalking down the runway to a dense, bass-heavy soundtrack in ferocious back-laced boots.</p><p>The opening look featured a wool felt trench with shoulders that Claude Montana could love. It was the first of several coats and jackets that emphasized the shoulders (broad) and waist (small) and were worn layered, in what has already become signature Proenza Schouler style, over intricate bustiers in metallics and muted jewel tones. Feathers, fur, lamé, and sparkle upped the luxury quotient, which reached its apex in a mink sequin coat cinched with a jeweled belt. McCollough and Hernandez played deftly with proportion, especially in jackets like the double-faced cashmere bolero with oversized pockets, and ended with a series of seductive dresses, seamed and fitted to cling to every curve, in which no woman could fail to claim the night.</p></div>"
90,fall,2004,f2004,ralph-lauren,"While it’s great to see new talent finding its wobbly way down the catwalk, sometimes it’s nice to relax in the hands of a professional—especially when he’s at the top of his form. Ralph Lauren’s fall collection, shown on the last day of Fashion Week, was smooth as charmeuse from start to finish: simple, perfectly cut clothes in excellent fabrics, worn by flawless models, to a mellow soundtrack courtesy of Fleetwood Mac.</p><p>Lauren opened with some body-hugging camel-hair pieces—a bateau-neck sweater, a high-waisted slim skirt—that were as cozy as they were sexy. Then he took firm possession of the tweedy trend running through fall, slamming out one great nubby piece after another: a chocolaty mélange, a bold black-and-white check, a frothy black bouclé occasionally dusted with sequins, that he made into trim little blazers, pencil skirts, classic trousers, and pretty ballerina skirts. His outerwear, particularly a generous trench cut from the sparkly black bouclé, was another home run, and Lauren even put a new twist (literally) on the now ubiquitous shrug by making it from a generous loop of cashmere. For drama, he added some blood-red velvet pieces and a lovely, spare black dress with a collarbone-framing scoop neck and graceful swirling skirt. And while the rest of the world is raiding grandma’s jewelry box for her big gold brooches, Lauren’s customer is going her own way, sporting big chunky antique Navajo belts, necklaces, and earrings that keep her suits from getting too fussy.</p><p>For evening, Lauren simply took the great sportswear motif and cut it with a little more va-va-voom. (Who knew a tuxedo jacket could have deep décolletage?) His closing gown, an inky stunner paved from head to toe with winking bugle beads, put a gleaming exclamation point on a very strong statement.</p></div>"
91,fall,2004,f2004,ralph-rucci,"Ralph Rucci will never be a trendsetter. He sets himself apart from all that nonsense to focus on—some might say obsess over—more serious matters like fabric and construction, adopting an intellectual approach that can sometimes get ponderous.</p><p>But the designer has been lightening up of late, and his fall collection proved that brainy and pretty can happily coexist. Using cashmeres, wools, and silks in muted colors—gray, taupe, dark green, violet, and black—Rucci cut slim pants, close-fitted skirts, and easy jersey dresses that are bound to please his discerning clientele. He also showed plenty of his boxy, swingy jackets, the construction of which recalls those other thinker-designers Geoffrey Beene and Cristobal Balenciaga. Rucci even addressed some current trends, via a simple dress covered with stacks of rouged-up mousseline ruffles, a pin-tucked suede skirt, and lots of fur accessories. But he did it all with such acute attention to detail as to transcend any sense of passing whim. (It takes commitment to perfectly tailor a pair of trousers from Russian broadtail or to insert sections of lambskin into the curves of a brown wool-crepe dress without creating a bump or buckle.) And in the case of a waist-length clutch jacket covered with gently wafting guinea hen feathers, the result was a tour de force.</p></div>"
92,fall,2004,f2004,revillon,"Rick Owens knows how to make a deconstructed fur look luxe, and that squares the circle at Revillon…almost. Put it this way: It's easy enough to believe that a woman of good yet conservative taste might comprehend the extravagant chic of, say, his white blanket-wrap mink edged in satin—maybe even see it as an investment, not a trendy buy. Ditto how a cash-rich, low-key coolster might rush to assimilate his dippy, dangly, tuft-sprouting shrugs, scarves, and fierce gauntlets into her wardrobe. Still, even for fans, there's something peculiar in the continuity between the clothes we recognize as Owens' own and those that turn up with a Revillon label.</p><p>Owens has certainly given his all to Revillon. That includes the cropped pants, his up-here, down-there skirts, his shades of greige and mouse, and the strange, almost hairless pallor of the models seen in his own show. Granted, for Revillon, he replaced his beloved denim with needle cord, abused in patches to the point of threadbare, which is certain to be influential. (And he swears those pieces aren't just fillers—they'll definitely be made and sold alongside the fur.)</p><p>In a certain way, all this shows integrity. On top of that, Owens deserves kudos for forging an anti-retro vision for fur. On the downside, why risk cannibalizing his own collection in this way? And grafting an underground aesthetic onto the classic ladylike Parisian fur-store experience is bound to produce certain, er, cultural misunderstandings. What kind of welcome will those scruffy Owens fans receive when they show up at Revillon's very proper front door?</p></div>"
93,fall,2004,f2004,rick-owens,"It's becoming clear that Rick Owens will never deviate from his core look. That drapey, goth-gone-overground thing is just what he does, and no amount of outside pressure is ever going to make him add in, say, a fifties print frock or a pie-frill blouse for the sake of hitting a seasonal trend. Still, the progress of his familiar, heavy-sandaled horde is interesting to watch. The asymmetric, traily things they're wearing for fall—all dipped in a delicate palette of mushroom, mouse, palest lemon, and robin's-egg blue—are actually an undercover version of incredibly wearable luxe.</p><p>Granted, to appreciate this we must first avert our eyes from the saggy-crotched, ribbed men's-underwear leggings: a definite boo-boo from any angle. Instead, for an appreciation of Rick's relevance, refer instead to his jackets. His signature washed-leather and boiled-cashmere compilations have now grown their own version of a peplum, which puts them coolly in line with some other current collections. Others, in curly-haired shearling or fur, are cut with a long scarflike attachment that gets draped and wrapped across the body in a generous cowl. Under these, it's all about layers, as always. The designer's cardigans, some knitted as finely as baby shawls, are flyaway additions to his basic long, skinny T-shirts.</p><p>Owens' pieces are now collectibles that find their way into the wardrobes of many kinds of women the world over. In other words, he's running a real business here. All he needs to do now is cut the repetitions in his presentation, please.</p></div>"
94,fall,2004,f2004,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli's runway, wrapped in gilded purple brocade, and his spectacular set—suggesting a Renaissance palazzo with its four-poster bed smothered in spotted fur and flanked by sculpted elephants—could only hint at the fabulous excesses to come. This season, dressing à la Cavalli involves an enticing melting pot of influences, from the lush fabrics favored by the princely merchants of sixteenth-century Venice to the Hapsburg splendors of Sissi, the beautiful nineteenth-century empress of Austria—all leavened with a dash of Johnny Depp-ian piratical swagger.</p><p>And youd need a pirate's ransom to get these clothes on your back; the great Parisian embroidery workrooms had clearly been toiling into the night to embellish Cavalli's collection, which was unbeatable for sheer, decadent luxe. A chinchilla chubby? Smother it with crystal frogging. A Persian lamb hussar's jacket? Lavish it with golden braid. A fabulous shearling, cut like an eighteenth-century man's coat? Encrust it with sparkling jewels. From the Lesage archives came a dazzling sunburst emblem, originally created for Schiaparelli in the 1930s, representing that other giddily opulent Sun King, Louis XIV. The designer gave it new life, lavishing it on furs, using it to anchor artfully draped jersey gowns, and even embroidering it on his teetering cavalier boots.</p><p>For the Cavalli gals fleeting daylight moments, he laid on elaborately seamed second-skin pants, doublets from a Bronzino portrait, and pirate shirts in brocade-print chiffons. Furs ran the gamut from outrageous to even more outrageous—the season's abbreviated bolero shape was pierced with crystal-bordered cutouts, and even a classic pony trench was overprinted with zebra stripes.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dsjjq""></div></div><p>But after dark, things really let rip. Cavalli was clearly thinking of grand seductions à la <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>—and what more could a great seducer hope for than a romp with a Cavalli diva, barely clad in a wispy chiffon dress, falling off a pale rose satin corset? (Or in anything from the playful finale lineup of short frocks with Madame de Pompadour bodices and a flurry of temptingly rustling skirts.) Yes, Cavalli's heroines just want to have fun—and in this heady collection, the designer served up a treasure trove of exactly that.</p></div>"
95,fall,2004,f2004,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens describes his role at Rochas as acting ""like a hinge between past and present."" That image helped explain the video projection of butterflies, opening and closing their multicolored wings, that played as a backdrop to his fall show—visuals that alluded to the fragile femininity and evanescent color that is emerging, slowly and methodically, from the chrysalis of this long-slumbering Parisian house.</p><p>The renewed look of Rochas has taken shape according to a fifties-couture template. Sculpting his silhouette around the idea of tiny bolero jackets and belled skirts, Theyskens has added his own, next-generation fascination with the structure of old-world underpinnings. Small suits and coats, often cut with curving volume in back, were interspersed with corset-dresses and flounced skirts made of the sheer, stiff crin that once formed the unseen underlayers of haute couture. ""It's really interesting that modern fabrics can evoke these old constructions,"" he said. ""But now we can use techniques like laser cutting, and that can make it better than the original.""</p><p>Theyskens moved the collection forward by sending out his girls in not-so-demure pointy metallic high-heel pumps in candy wrapper-bright turquoise, violet, green, and cherry red. A touch of fluidity and draping turned up in silk camisoles—loose at the breast, tucked into skirts at the back—to create new, bloused, flyaway volumes. As a contrast, his new coat shape, a molded couture duffel, came fastened with ""hinge"" toggles. In all, this collection was a concise, measured development of the brand-building look Theyskens has been working since he joined the house.</p></div>"
96,fall,2004,f2004,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford left the stage with a vividly memorable performance—polished, mature, and perfectly pitched. And that was just the clothes. As for the man, and the way he acquitted himself at a crucial hour, precisely the same description applies. The central player in the most seismic fashion drama of recent memory bowed out smiling, fielding kisses and congratulations with affectionate thanks and a dash of Texan good humor. Tearing an overwrought woman off the shoulder of his red velvet smoking jacket, he said, ""Oh, come on. I'm just takin' a break, that's all!""</p><p>This is a man (an actor by first calling, after all) who knows how to play an emotional scene light. Not that it can't have been nerve-wracking, to say the least, to design the collection that, for better or worse, will go down as his last big statement at Yves Saint Laurent. Which chapter of YSL history to call up for his grand finale? As it turned out, he chose the unexpected: the 1977 Chinese collection that coincided with the launch of Opium. Why? ""Instinct,"" he said. ""I felt the pagoda shoulder was right. And it was a period I hadn't mined.""</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>So, the pagoda shoulder (albeit far more rounded and up-there than Yves's original squared pads) it was—as well as the opportunity for Ford to show what he can do with the concept of chic color clash. The opening look said it all: a crimson silk Mao jacket, a scarlet satin pencil skirt, and a pair of purple velvet wedges with wicked curved-in heels. Then came that shoulder, also with a slither of lingerie satin skirt, a twinning repeated in a series of color contrasts: turquoise with leaf green, poudre pink and grape, and so on.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""547wm""></div></div><p>Ford worked the chinoiserie theme in many keys: subtly, in furs shaved in the pattern of dragon's scales; or full-on, in a tight jet beaded jacket as shiny as a lacquered cabinet. It became both more delicate and sharply sophisticated with the eveningwear. Fragile cheongsams came many ways: fitted sleekly to every curve, in nude silk with an erotic fluff of fur tracing the fastening, in cut-out embroidered lace, or as a full-length cascade of red chiffon flounces.</p><p>The designer also pared away the famous Saint Laurent smokings to become nipped one-button jackets with a deep luxurious wrap of black satin collar. It was the finale dresses that will likely prove the lasting image of Ford's leave-taking, however. Vividly patterned, totally sequined slink-gowns, they slithered along the runway trailing the kind of Hollywood glory for which this man will surely be remembered. Until, of course, his next act…</p></div>"
97,fall,2004,f2004,sebastian-pons,"Sebastian Pons presented his sophomore collection, inspired by Inquisition-era Spain, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, a former synagogue on New York’s Lower East Side.</p><p>Pons showed some beautiful pieces and confirmed his power as a storyteller with looks like his “communion” suits and a “cardinal” coat. (Though there were times when his narrative got the better of him—who, after all, really wants to look like an altar boy?) The superb craftsmanship that established him as a designer to watch was evident in a print coat with center-front lacing (an update on the stunning Chanel-y suit he showed for spring), some flirty knit skirts, and two very wearable medieval-style dresses featuring chain mail and crystal, courtesy of Swarovski. This was a show that would not have been complete without a fairy-tale ending, which it got via the final look—a strict, chic gown with a subtle train in white and gold brocade. Amen to that.</p></div>"
98,fall,2004,f2004,sonia-rykiel,"A Sonia Rykiel show is, as they say, a French thing. Season after season, year after year, her collections always look the same. That's not to criticize what she does, but simply to say that Rykiel is so deeply involved with her version of <em>Ça C'est Paris!</em> chic—foxy forties frocks, slinky skinny sweaters, fur stoles, and always, always black hose— that she never feels the need to deviate. Trends of the moment might make themselves felt on her runway, but always in the service of Rykiel's true muse: the <em>très jolie</em> mademoiselle of Left Bank café society.</p><p>But—quelle surprise!—this season, Rykiel threw in some looks that wouldn't be out of place at Pastis, like a curvy brown houndstooth tweed coat, a black astrakhan jacket pinned with a diamanté bow brooch, or a floral chiffon tea dress that showed just the tiniest hint of the peach silk slip underneath. As for her recurring accessory of choice—a black beret with a jewel pin—well, some things just don't translate.</p></div>"
99,fall,2004,f2004,sophia-kokosalaki,"It is rare to find a 30-year-old who has a completely thought-out aesthetic that can sustain the flow of a collection without wavering or breaking the spell of its own coherence. Sophia Kokosalaki, the diffidently impressive Greek designer, is such a talent—quietly carving out a coolly elegant way of dressing that springs both from her ethnic roots and her reality as a young, urban, cosmopolitan woman.</p><p>Kokosalaki is great at dresses, to begin with. For fall, she draped and twisted bronze and antique-gold jersey into short, sexy shapes detailed with tiny pleats. The provocation was tempered with opaque tights and tough boots. For evening, her little black dresses, like a jersey smock with a raw tulle-ruffled neckline or a draped strapless tulip dress, were stellar.</p><p>In between, she served up her signature glossily patinated leather jackets, great pants, and tiny, flattering blazers. As an erotic surprise, she slipped a plunging cross-laced bodice beneath a skirt suit. The layered complexity of this collection came not just in the way Kokosalaki put pieces together, but in her personal connection to them. The flat pleating and discreet but quietly rich embroideries that Kokosalaki has claimed for her decorative devices all come from the folk costume of her mother country. But in her hands, it became clothing for Everywoman. Her final outfit, a heavy fur vest emblazoned with medallions of real antique Greek embroidery and worn over a high-waisted dress, had the international press rushing backstage for a closer look.</p></div>"
100,fall,2004,f2004,stella-mccartney,"With Tom Ford (and CEO Domenico De Sole) now out the door at Gucci Group, these must be unsettled times for the other designers whose houses are owned by the company. This might account for the lack of focus that came across in Stella McCartney's collection. Generally pretty tuned in to what her girl wants to wear—and, just as importantly, how she wants to look in it—McCartney was a bit wobbly here. Some of her excursions into volume looked a little troublesome: Anyone for a huge satin and nylon quilted coat that looks like you just swiped the duvet off the bed and went out the door? Thought not.</p><p>But there were moments that worked. McCartney was on much-surer ground when she took her silhouette closer to the body and let the swing of the godets on a slipper-satin skirt or a jersey dress introduce a touch of fluidity and fullness without ever overwhelming the body. She also had some success when her street-savvy tailoring didn¿t stray into the realms of the supersized, such as with a close-fit houndstooth jacket in pale caramel and pink tones, worn with khaki pants tucked into faux-leather seventies-style boots.</p><p>There was the return of the chunky Peruvian sweaters that McCartney must have remembered from her childhood (worn, no doubt, by mom Linda), now looking like a neat update on Fair Isle knits. And there were some good accessories, always a challenge for someone dedicated to never using fur or leather. The standout: a canvas sneaker resting on a high rubber heel.</p></div>"
101,fall,2004,f2004,tim-van-steenbergen,"If Belgian designer Tim Van Steenbergen were a movie director, he would probably be part of the Dogma group, radically challenging the norms of what we expect from the medium. Van Steenbergen cast his fall show, as he did last season, from dance and music schools in Antwerp. ""No professional models!"" he said proudly, just before the show kicked off, and they proceeded to walk the runway while singing their version of ""Mad World,"" the theme from <em>Donnie Darko</em>. At the end of the show, the students lined up looking like some kind of Belgian conceptualist choir. There would probably be a huge demand for them on the alternative cabaret circuit.</p><p>These high jinks shouldn't detract from the seriousness with which van Steenbergen approaches the task in hand. (Sometimes too seriously: While not as wildly conceptual as some, he doesn't always grasp that fashion should flatter. There was an unpleasant moment when a patchwork velvet skirt that could have been worn by about three people hovered into view.) That misstep notwithstanding, Van Steenbergen is down with what a certain cool girl wants to wear. He understands that there is just as much room in her closet for crepe de chine as there is for washed, worn-looking cotton canvas. The faded navy parka with a voluminous back and deep ribbed cuffs was wonderful, ditto the wasp-waist jacket with leg-of-mutton sleeves and the washed silk bias-cut dresses in scarlet or chocolate.</p><p>On the runway, the way these clothes are put together can look like too much. But the trick with a designer like this is to cherry pick; the individual finds can be rather good.</p></div>"
102,fall,2004,f2004,tuleh,"Anyone who has ever run screaming from the word ""ladylike"" might take a look at Tuleh, where Bryan Bradley has successfully unstuffed that formidable term and made a new generation of women yearn for elegance. The label has been a socialite mainstay for years, but it’s only recently that the company has reached for a broader audience—hence the runway shows.</p><p>Bradley’s brief, buoyant fall collection (his second in the tents) showed his deft hand with tricky elements. There were delightfully unexpected color combinations (a yellow wool coat trimmed with gray fox, a coral and green lace dress) and intense, attention-grabbing fabrics, like bold tweeds or elaborate jacquards shot through with metallic and layered with lace. Beautiful tweed jackets had Tuleh’s signature twists: raw edges, extended cuffs, and dressmaker details, plus an occasional camellia-adorned lapel, to make clear their debt to Chanel. For night, he turned the volume down, showing only a few mutely simple black silk dresses and gowns.</p><p>The designer wisely kept silhouettes simple and tailored, occasionally adding a knee-grazing scarf or some giant clear buttons for a bit of whimsy. And that’s the secret to Tuleh’s success: a sense of fun that came through loud and clear in the tissue-thin cashmere T-shirts, printed with a Tuleh logo that looked like it could have come off a bottle of barbecue sauce and a range of mottos, including “we is (sic) family.” Those T-shirts, layered over silky dresses and blouses, are destined for socialite closets worldwide—along with the rest of this collection.</p></div>"
103,fall,2004,f2004,undercover,"It¿s always somewhat dispiriting to hear the hectoring tones of Patti Smith as a show gets underway; it normally means that, fashion-wise, doom and gloom are on the agenda. Thankfully, this wasn't the case at Undercover. It was Ms. Smith's androgynous, 1970s New Wave style—her layers of dinner jackets, striped vests, and slouchy shirts, worn with stretch leggings or faded denims—by which designer Jun Takahashi was inspired.</p><p>Yet, unlike the many Japanese teenagers in Tokyo and beyond who copy the styles of rock icons with staggering accuracy, Takahashi wasn't interested in merely paying sartorial homage to the woman who gave us <em>Horses</em>. He has a sly, witty way with fashion and he used Smith's style as the starting point for an exploration of how clothes change with wear over the years. As the show progressed, Takahashi's designs appeared to soften and age: The jackets, some lightly quilted, became a little more oversized and slope-shouldered, while the T-shirts stretched to become tunics. Even the felt fedora hats seemed to get floppier by the minute.</p><p>Takahashi also explored the way in which clothes get made more personal as time goes by: tying a clutch of scarves onto the waistband of a pair of pants; decorating a shawl by pinning it with stuffed felt charms in the shape of medals and keys (these trinkets were inspired by the work of artist Anne-Valerie Dupond); giving a jacket random buttons—as if his wannabe Pattis had simply been too busy mosh-pitting to even consider replacing the fastenings they'd lost with ones that matched.</p></div>"
104,fall,2004,f2004,united-bamboo,"Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham have been part of New York's indie art-fashion scene for half a decade now, but this season marked the United Bamboo duo's runway debut. Held on Park Avenue at the Scandinavia House, a venue chosen for its clean modernity, the show drew Proenza Schouler's Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough in the front row, and featured a live soundtrack of breathy vocals and acoustic guitar by Together, the brand-new musical collaboration between Rusty Santos and Noah.</p><p>United Bamboo like to play on all-American, usually preppy, staples, and their fall show was billed as ""downtown chic going to an uptown party."" The uptown quotient predominated in a succession of proper ensembles—tweedy and pleated skirts, pin-tuck trousers, bow-tied dresses. While a certain amount of irony was implicit, it was a relief when fur- and scarf-trimmed box jackets were removed to reveal more adventurous, even punky, layered and pieced tops. There were also some interesting tailoring details, such as a removable tail on a tuxedo suit. The ""disheveled glamour"" Aoki and Pham aimed to evoke was most successfuly achieved in a striking outsized navy stripe trenchcoat, pea and duffle coats with expandable pockets, and a pleated skirt gathered by a wool harness at the waist.</p></div>"
105,fall,2004,f2004,valentino,"With so much softness, lightness, and unabashed luxury everywhere this season, it would seem obvious for Valentino to take his collection in that direction, too. After all, what could be more perfect for <em>le jet set</em>? But the designer doesn't seem to feel that way. Instead, this fall, Val's gals are as intent on creating a charged erotic frisson as they are in looking elegant. Think of the work of the late photographer Helmut Newton and you'll get the general idea: predatory women who like to flaunt whatever God did (sexy curves) or didn¿t (serious rocks) give them.</p><p>Valentino played up that feeling with references to the divine decadence of Marlene Dietrich in her <em>Blue Angel</em> era. That inspiration was best expressed by the black chiffon evening dresses that closed the show: slim columns, their simplicity complemented by a draped bodice or a back or front sliced to reveal an embroidered or satin bra.</p><p>While the designer showed mostly black for evening (and put on the runway only one of his trademark red dresses, a taffeta number appliquéd with flowers) there were welcome flashes of color in his daywear: a reed-thin mauve silk charmeuse dress, a pale pink organza shirt worn with a floor-length ruffled skirt. To ward off a night chill, there were fur boleros that looked like a more substantial version of the evening shrug that has been a recurrent idea on this season's runways. Valentino might have been inspired by a platinum blonde from days gone by, but it's intriguing to think what a more contemporary version—someone like Gwen Stefani, say—might do with one of those dazzling evening dresses right now.</p></div>"
106,fall,2004,f2004,vera-wang,"It’s getting increasingly difficult to categorize Vera Wang as a designer. Her clothes are thoughtful, but romantic too; artistic, but eminently wearable; and sexy, without being overtly so. Of course, you could just call them beautiful and leave it at that.</p><p>Although she’s still best known for her evening and wedding gowns, Wang’s daywear is coming on strong. For fall, she worked in a muted palette, mixing dusty, tea-dipped colors like taupe and pink with intense greens and purples as well as black and brown. She cut slim skirts and trousers with neat, narrow waistbands that sat low—but not too low—on the hips and showed them with soft blouses, bare-armed chiffon tops, and tissue-thin cashmere sweaters. There were strict, sharp wool coats over satin dresses, gleaming furs, and wispy, pin-tucked dresses, often paired with chunky fur shrugs. Wang even dabbled in abstract prints, like a muted wine-toned splattered silk that showed up in a lean little dress with an inset waistband of raw-edged tweed.</p><p>The designer showed a similar restraint in her evening looks. She shaped her chiffon confections with bias cuts or hand-sewn details and touched them with just the right amount of beading or ruffles—as well as plenty of pieces from her own line of diamond jewelry. And why not? Having put together a collection this strong, Wang has earned the right to gild her own lily.</p></div>"
107,fall,2004,f2004,veronique-branquinho,"With a simple dimming of the lights and the switching on of a projector, Veronique Branquinho transformed a downbeat Paris dance hall into a midnight woodland—stark trees silhouetted on the walls, will-o'-the-wisp mist rolling ankle-deep across the floor. Into that magical setting, she sent a new take on her reserved but strangely forceful vision of young, self-respecting womanhood. From the moment her first long-silhouetted girl began stepping her way through the mist in a wax-coated jacket, ankle-length jersey skirt, and high glossy boots, it was clear the audience was in for an experience out of the ordinary. ""I wanted it to be strong but elegant—and intimate,"" she said.</p><p>With covered-up primness a growing trend this season, Branquinho is firmly on the territory she began staking out with her first Victorian-influenced collection in 1997. Yet as high-necked and unrevealing as her clothes may be—from the turtleneck tweed blousons to the silk print long-sleeve shirt-dresses—there is nothing in the least bit dowdy about them. Instead, her look has the quiet sexual power of the girl who knows she needn't flicker so much as an eyelash to turn heads.</p><p>The hallmarks of Branquinho's clothes are part seventies Ali MacGraw, part Brontë heroine, and entirely Antwerp individualist: lanky lines, a slightly puff-sleeved shoulder line, wrap dresses, and accessories like long knitted scarves. For winter, she's also added sparkle to the look, in brown or cobalt sequinned skirts and vests. Balanced beautifully between romanticism and realism, this was a collection that sent the audience out chattering with admiration.</p></div>"
108,fall,2004,f2004,versace,"Donatella Versace can relate to the cross-generational appeal of punk. Her brother Gianni frequently referenced it (remember that famous safety-pin dress), and for fall, she revisited the 30-year-old style as a kind of house classic. Strangely enough, it worked as a perfect medium for dressing the chic modern mom. As proved by the soundtrack—Chrissie Hynde at her gritty best—age cannot dim the spirit of the hardcore rock chick, and this show translated that attitude into some great daywear.</p><p>Donatella is not the first to try shredding the edges of tartan, but her plaid suits, in combinations of red and white, purple and black, or yellow and white, had a fierceness of cut that was pure Versace. And with their back-combed chignons and dark glasses, her women can throw a cashmere cardigan over a houndstooth sheath (complete with sparkling brooch) and make it look a million miles from frumpy. That in itself was a cheering sight in a season that poses many potential styling problems for the grown-up woman: classy, but just sexy enough to show you ain't retired yet.</p><p>By comparison, Versace's eveningwear was more predictable, with the photo-op possibilities ranging from several slashed black dresses to the anatomically sliced red finale. Though these will be much in evidence on the red carpet in coming weeks, it's the strong daywear that's likely to pull in new customers for the house.</p></div>"
109,fall,2004,f2004,versus-versace,"Here's the news about Versus this season: It's not so much a collection that young, rebellious women will go out to buy for themselves, as it is a safe destination for mother-and-teen-daughter shopping. Donatella Versace (who of course has her own teenage daughter, Allegra, to bounce ideas off) was recently taken by a story in the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> that discussed how the punk ethos has been sanitized over the years. The article (reprinted from <em>The New York Times</em>) pointed out that now even private-school kids are weekend punks, tolerated and often encouraged by their world-wise parents.</p><p>That explains Donatella's program note, describing the punk-inspired Versus show as, ""A subversive mixture of education and rebellion."" She addressed the eternal parental fashion-control issue by allowing her junior collection to go out the door looking like a shorter, tartier, big-haired version of the grown-up Versace line. That meant a lot of tartan mini-kilts, orange biker suits, and tiger-patterned denims, and a loading of metal hardware in the form of heavy Medusa-head cuffs and chain belts. For extra measure, she also threw in a few skimpy asymmetric jersey dresses, just to prevent those daughterly raids on Versace Mom's eveningwear closet. So, now the moral becomes clear: A girl who gets good grades might just be rewarded with a little trip to Versus. After all, as we know from the dear old Osbournes, the family that rocks together stays together.</p></div>"
110,fall,2004,f2004,viktor-rolf,"Viktor &amp; Rolf's audience is still trying to adjust to the Dutch duo's surprising segue into commercial clothes. After the recent 10-year retrospective of their ultra avant-garde work, the pair moved on to a new phase: producing their version of real-life fashion. Their fall show featured headgear that was still up there in the conceptual ether—antlers for some, Bambi sprouts for others—and a soundtrack that added the threat of hunters' gunfire. But underneath, all the clothes were reworkings of regular garments. As Rolf Snoeren explained, ""We wanted to create a sort of fashion fairy tale. We've always loved classics and we think they are something special, which should be protected.""</p><p>The walk in the woods began with a sensible loden, high-collared belted coat. It was followed by an outfit that, in its way, commented on all the ladylike silhouette-crafting that's going on in the fashion mainstream: a bolero jacket over a ribbed gray turtleneck and a wrap skirt fastened with a sparkling jewel. A camel car coat with a double collar was a reminder of the exaggerated multi-lapels the designers have piled on in former times; the device reappeared later, much watered-down, in double-fronted shirts. For all their reputation as out-there performance artists, Viktor Horsting and Snoeren are now displaying a canny knack for trend. Wide-leg pants, newly emerged this season, were in their collection, nicely done in fluid tuxedo suits. Ditto, brooches—great, big rose sprigs or slightly sinister oversized spiders were pinned to the breasts of coats or at the throat on scarves.</p><p>Perhaps all this connectedness is down to the guys' decision to get out of the house more. Like the thorough students they are, they recently embarked on a fact-finding mission to the Golden Globes to research Hollywood celebrity. The results could be seen at the end of their show, in a series of glamour gowns. Swarovksi glitter sheaths came out swathed in chiffon, emerald charmeuse goddess gowns were studded with golden jewels, and plunging black lace floated over nude linings.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tgg0gj""></div></div><p>Something, however, is slightly wrong with this picture—and one can never help suspecting (hoping, even) that the effect is a conscious stroke of irony. Because the last thing anyone needs to see is a pair of extraordinary talents like Horsting and Snoeren—designers who have blown our minds in the past—subsiding into something indistinguishable from normality.</p></div>"
111,fall,2004,f2004,ys-yohji-yamamoto,"Heavy cotton drill parkas? Check. Huge cargo pants? Check. More than a little noir? Check. Season after season, there are certain elements that Yohji Yamamoto includes in his Y's collection. The only things missing this time around were the enormous chunky knits that have been so appealing to him in the past. (Though he did manage to slip a few into the proceedings—layered, if you can imagine, over short military surplus-style anoraks.) The designer also gave a nod to both his past and his present: the former via some Edwardian-era tailcoats with a complicated arrangement of buttons and the latter with the very Y-3-like, sporty biker jackets in a mix of neoprene and leather. Just in case those assembled didn't quite register the provenance of the zippered jackets, he dropped a heavy hint by emblazoning their backs with the logo ""YamaMOTO."" The designer's usual subtlety had obviously roared off somewhere on a 50-cc engine.</p><p>That's not to say that everything was familiar: Yamamoto gave a contemporary spin to some khaki cotton suits by pairing them with rockabilly-style crepe-soled shoes. And, in a season where the chiffon blouse has been reinterpreted over and over again, there was something alluring about his cool, crisp cotton shirts—reworked to perfection with panels of fabric that looked like deconstructed bows affixed to the collar or the cuffs.</p></div>"
112,fall,2004,f2004,yohji-yamamoto,"The first fall offerings from Yohji Yamamoto were six soft, multicolored, printed tailcoats, laid out on the floor of a freezing school hall. Perhaps the result of a journey to Tibet, Uzbekistan, or somesuch folkloric pilgrimage? ""No,"" he said laconically. ¿I just wanted to prove I can do color.¿ The patterns¿flowery, mini-paisley mixes, ink jet-printed on double-faced flannel¿suggested, he said cheerfully, ¿a cheap hotel.¿</p><p>Then in filed a Yamamoto army of quiffed rockabillies, picking up the coats and shrugging them over layers of printed tunics and slouchy cuffed trousers in a nice m¿l¿e of dusty blues, violet, ocher, and cinnamon. Having made the color point, Yamamoto reverted to his beloved all-black avant-garde cutting, this season scissored into an Edwardiana-meets-rocker kind of elegance.</p><p>Variations on high-collared cutaway coats, shown with cropped pants and biker boots, have a lanky swagger. While some are hung with chrome chains and others come with snowflake-knit sleeves, the most sophisticated tailoring is paired with bunchy velvet bows, spilling artfully from the front. Another experiment (a subtle dig at the alarming proliferation of must-have bags, maybe?) places big leather pockets at the front of skewed pea coats, receptacles roomy enough to allow a woman to roam the world hands-free.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""cuwyd""></div></div><p>The best came last: a striking sequence of sweeping greatcoats and capes with layers of collars and oversize brass and chrome buttons. Part military, part highwayman, the variations include a tiny-waisted version, its huge collar trimmed in white sailor braid, and a trench whose detail is picked out in red patent leather. The effect¿gutsy and chic at the same time¿reveals Yamamoto leading fashion¿s forward march once more.</p></div>"
113,fall,2004,f2004,zac-posen,"To provide a backdrop for his fall collection, titled <em>Blixen</em> (as in reindeer), Zac Posen carpeted the floor of a Bryant Park tent with black Astroturf and installed a grove of silvery tree sculptures. Of course, Posen’s audience is its own decor (this season it included Claire Danes and the artist Chuck Close), but the designer is a born showman and he loves to set a stage.</p><p>He’s also, five seasons into his career, developing real range, not to mention an inventive sense of color and solid craftsmanship. His signatures—the neckline that arches chinward and then plunges deep into the décolleté, the hourglass fit, the mitered stripes—were all present and accounted for. But there were new developments, too: Posen worked in a lot of jersey and knits, which softened his edges and produced some lovely looks, like a pink cashmere dress or a charming black knit T-shirt, trimmed in blue ribbon and worn with a simple black pencil skirt. Even the pieced geometric dresses in contrasting hues fell on the wearable side of artsy.</p><p>The designer’s evening showstoppers included a figure-hugging polychrome lace sheath, a fluttery pin-tucked organza dress, and a dreamy blue organza ball gown. It may have all been based on fantasy, but Posen produced a real-life wardrobe that goes from morning coffee straight through to the last nightcap.</p></div>"
1,spring,2005,s2005,a-f-vandevorst,"Antwerp must have a pretty great nightlife, if the rock-club-inspired spring collection from Belgian duo An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, collectively known as A.F. Vandevorst, is any representation. They play great music (Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood's trippy duet ""Some Velvet Morning"" made the soundtrack); they have modest but effective light shows (here, a curtain of multicolored bulbs); and the crowd is always hip-looking.</p><p>It's not the first time that clubbing has worked its influence on the world of A.F. Vandevorst; the duo once memorably turned their runway into a vast mirror ball. This year, the inspiration was at its most obvious in the touches of silver or gold that sparkled amid their mostly monochromatic palette, and their disco-ready glittery boots and strappy wedge sandals. But Vandevorst and Arickx used it in a far subtler way, by drawing on the grunge/rave club cultures of the nineties. Out strode the models, in the usual zigzag formation, wearing zippered hoodies and leggings with ruffled dresses and trenches, or soft, slouchy shirts over tiered skirts with lace-trim petticoats peeking out beneath. All of this was an imaginative lesson in layering clothes in an interesting and effective way. This collection was also a reminder of how, season after season, Vandevorst and Arickx rework their signature pieces to make great fashion. Some of this show's strongest offerings came from the biker jackets and cardigans that fastened with leather saddle straps, and the presence, yet again, of those billowing, masculine trenches.</p></div>"
2,spring,2005,s2005,akris,"Unlike many labels, the Swiss house of Akris doesn't use ear-splitting music or crazy styling to jazz up its understated urban staples. This season did, though, see a small yet significant change: Instead of showing at its chic Paris HQ, the house chose the Carrousel du Louvre, the location favored by the likes of Chanel and Valentino. Quiet and refined or not, designer Albert Kriemler just may be trying to edge Akris into the spotlight.</p><p>Either way, Kriemler's spring collection was as clean and fresh as an alpine morning. He referenced the innocence and purity of his roots via billowing, snow-white linen peasant blouses and flared cotton skirts. But Switzerland is also home to some really hefty bank accounts, so the Akris woman is well versed in the language of international moneyed chic: Witness a white cotton double-faced trenchcoat with tulle edges over supernarrow trousers, or a white linen bustier with a full organdy skirt etched in shell-like swirls of cotton. From there on in, the collection embraced some of the season's key colors (sage green, sea blue, sweet pink) and gotta-have-'em pieces (cuffed shorts, little jackets, billowing skirts).</p><p>Kriemler closed with lightweight tulle evening dresses in shades of taupe and beige; while some were worn with heels, it was the few that came out with flat thong sandals that looked most in step with spring 2005.</p></div>"
3,spring,2005,s2005,alberta-ferretti,"""Liberty and freedom!"" declared Alberta Ferretti backstage at her pretty spring collection. No, she hadn't been taking notes from a presidential candidate's speechwriter; the mantra reflected her belief that ""fashion is a form of freedom … [and] the new lightness reflects a liberation of the mind.""</p><p>In runway terms, this translated into a Sarah Jessica Parker-esque layering of eclectic elements—a striped matelot sweater with a bell skirt, a tight rib-silk Victorian or rajah jacket with Capri pants—in off-key but surprisingly charming color combinations (pansy purple and teal; mint with scarlet and Parma violet). Ferretti's feel for the season's breezy new proportions led her to layer her ravishing signature chiffon dresses (often laser-cut to evoke the elaborately slashed doublets of Elizabethan courtiers) over voluminous puffball skirts in stiff faille, so that her hemlines billowed like up-ended mushroom clouds.</p><p>Keira Knightley might have been contending with SJP as Ferretti's muse of the season, for there was a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> spirit to the décolleté milkmaid dresses and smocked A-line bodices, and to the deliberately handcrafted effects. Patchworks of different-colored chiffon were sewn together to create elaborate evening gowns; other dresses featured panels seemingly held in place with a cross-lacing of plaited chiffon ties—bearing the saucy promise of instant disintegration in a light breeze on the high seas.</p></div>"
4,spring,2005,s2005,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Even before Alessandro Dell'Acqua's spring collection had begun, his audience was suffering from dampened spirits after being plunged, on a sunny morning, into a dark hall to view eveningwear. Since Dell'Acqua's signature is light, flighty dresses and tops, the vaguely twenties-through-sixties cornflower-blue and nude pieces with which he opened had a familiar charm. Fine—but after that, the pressure of expanding the show to fill a long runway led to a distinct lack of focus.</p><p>Like every Milanese designer this season, Dell'Acqua felt the pressure to show something Indian influenced. That resulted in a sort of eighteenth century raj theme: short paisley caftan dresses, palm tree- and animal-embroidered silk jackets and microshorts, and, in the pant department, the baleful influence of jodhpurs. It all got even more confusing when the designer sent out a couple of black lace items that nodded emphatically in the direction of Rochas.</p><p>No doubt the inherent prettiness of the clothes will be more evident in the surroundings of a boutique. But Dell'Acqua would do himself and his audience a favor if, next season, he edits more ruthlessly—and shows in a less deadly venue.</p></div>"
5,spring,2005,s2005,alexander-mcqueen,"“It was a lot of McQueen, all in one big collection.” Thus spake the designer after a performance that came across as a positioning statement—in more ways than one. The presentation summed up all his experience in sharp tailoring, spectacular romantic dresses, couture richness, and downright showmanship. And, with every look laid out on a giant chessboard, it couldn’t help but suggest a metaphor for the workings of the fashion industry.</p><p>The chess device allowed McQueen to redo all his greatest moments, but in a prettier, lighter, more accessible way. He used the 1975 film <em>Picnic at Hanging Rock</em> to work a girlish Edwardian theme, starting with tiny sailor jackets, school blazers, ticking-striped shirts, and gray knee-length shorts, then adding lovely white lace blouses and dresses. From there, it was onto the eighteenth century, in the form of precious flower-embroidered jackets over candy-striped puffball skirts, and dreamy floral chiffon dresses floating from Empire bodices.</p><p>By the time the 36 models had taken up their positions, reminders of all McQueen’s past signatures and silhouettes were in place: the Savile Row-sharp tail coats; richly embroidered Japanese kimonos; streamlined sci-fi bodysuits; rigid molded corsets; and stiff, flounced godet skirts. En masse, it was very impressive. And even if this comprehensive résumé didn’t move his game along, most of the ideas had benefited from the designer’s revisions. They looked even better second time around: more feminine, less aggressive, and much more desirable. Checkmate!</p></div>"
6,spring,2005,s2005,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Alexandre Herchcovitch is nothing if not industrious—he designs seven lines (exclusive of licensing) in his native Brazil. This season, he defected from the Paris schedule to show his men's and women's lines in New York. ""Children walking through a geometric garden,"" was the theme of the women's collection. He started the mood by building a big, circular maze of flowers on his runway—a lovely setting with a double meaning, given his September 11 show date. ""I am giving to New York big, big flowers—especially today,"" the designer said. The models, their faces obscured with crisscrossed braids, navigated the runway like twirling dancers in a jewelry box.</p><p>To his credit, Herchcovitch's clothes held their own in this theatrical setting. He chose a kaleidoscopic palette, and mixed prints and patterns, creating ensembles with strong separates. The show opened with a romper and ran to a lovely stamped-rubber swing dress, worn by fellow Brazilian Cintia Dicker. More-accessible options were the many swing tops in patterned and pieced silks, and colorful Empire dresses with a small flounce in the back. In the past, Herchcovitch's execution has sometimes been heavy-handed; with this spring show, he achieved a pleasing (and fragrant) balance between the two.</p></div>"
7,spring,2005,s2005,alistair-carr,"You have to get up very early—or stay up extremely late—to catch a new entry on the London fashion scene these days. Alistair Carr—whose name might (just) have rung a bell with anyone who attended the Central Saint Martins master's degree show a couple of years ago—made his official debut at a breakfast presentation in the Royal Academy of Arts. Nice venue—but there was plenty of pre-show grumbling among the valiant ranks of attendees who waited interminably for his act to begin. Why <em>were</em> we here, anyway?</p><p>The answer wasn't all that clear even by the time Carr's last outfit—a double-tiered meringue of white and ombré blue tulle with a kind of sport top—had made its exit. His collection had worked its way, puzzlingly, around voluminous techno-fabric blousons, hammerhead studded decoration, pleats, and dresses in which the skirts were suspended from the tops. While many of these novelties have been seen before, Carr did pull off a single merge that had the stamp of genuine innovation: a couple of shiny black nylon wraps with romantic, puffy chiffon inserts bouncing in the hem. That hasn't been seen before, and Carr really may have what it takes, over time. In the meanwhile, though, he needs to learn how to focus a collection on a couple of ideas, and get them across in the quickest way possible.</p></div>"
8,spring,2005,s2005,ann-demeulemeester,"At first glance, an Ann Demeulemeester show looks like the homeward march of a tribe of Belgian Goths after yet another lost weekend in an Antwerp club. But in fact, Demeulemeester's business success is thanks to a following, not of club kids, but of women in their thirties and forties.</p><p>Strange but true: All those pieces—malleable, crunchy paper-light leathers, coolster blazers, asymmetrically traily knits, slouchy pants, and great boots—meld quite happily into the wardrobes of women who've been too busy working and raising children to have been near a basement dive for years. They'll sift through this collection as they always do, finding in it a way to wear color (shades of orange, this time) or adapt a frill to their lifestyle (on a dippy layered skirt, perhaps). The fashion crowd may lose patience with Demeulemeester's measured, skeptical approach to trend—not to mention those persistent dangling straps— but her customers would no doubt be horrified by too much change.</p><p>It's amazing to realize that Demeulemeester has been designing for almost 20 years; she emerged in Antwerp at the same time as Dries Van Noten, who celebrated his 50th collection with a massive party in Paris this week. Demeulemeester commemorated a personal turning point of her own, in a very different way, for spring: Some of her favorite signature T-shirts were printed with a black-and-white photograph of her son Viktor, who is now 18. ""He left home this week to go to art school in Brussels,"" said the proud mom backstage. Sweet.</p></div>"
9,spring,2005,s2005,anna-molinari,"Some of Rossella Tarabini's spring dresses are so delicate, they had to be laid out on the floor like a bevy of reclining fairies before the show. Handmade, wispy concoctions of blush-hued plissé georgette, charmeuse, and lace, they looked like the contents of a Victorian trousseau. ""They are my dream dresses,"" Tarabini said, a combined result of her obsession with fine lingerie and a photograph of the Russian royal family she had pinned to her inspiration board.</p><p>On the runway, these dresses were interspersed with shorts and cropped pantsuits—sometimes in the shiny, candy-wrapper metallics that are appearing all over Milan—and balanced on seventies-esque wedges. Tarabini's little jackets were occasionally funked up with Pop Art plastic pins in the form of lips, stars, and wings—but as she said, this collection was more about pure romance than rock chick. When the final group of pleated chiffons came out, the barefoot models looked as if they were channeling Madame Récamier on her way to bed. This is Tarabini's own personal vision, and while it might not change the direction of fashion, some of her special pieces have the air of lovely collectibles.</p></div>"
10,spring,2005,s2005,anna-sui,"Anna Sui often pegs her collections to a certain era: In recent seasons, she's spun through on hippie chic, mod style, and moody, sixties-era Biba girls. This season, Sui drew on the rich romance of the American West in the late nineteenth century, plucking bits and pieces from cowboys, Indians, settlers, soldiers, and (in a more modern moment) rhinestone-bedecked rodeo girls. ""With all the interest in Victoriana right now, it makes sense to look to what was going on in our country,"" Sui said. ""This is what was happening here.""</p><p>Sui always puts on a good show: The soundtrack is carefully chosen (this season, those New Romantic admirers of the Old West, Adam and the Ants, figured large). And every exit is an outfit, with appropriate accessories: for instance, a cropped denim jacket over a pintucked voile dress, with an embroidered petticoat underneath, all wrapped with a silver conch belt and accessorized with scrunched cowboy boots and a scruffy hat. At first, that comes across as costumey; take it apart, though, and you see why Sui is a veteran favorite of the downtown, rock 'n' roll crowd. All the trends are there, but confidently Sui-ified: loose, light frocks in vintage-looking floral prints, sweet voile pintucked blouses, full petticoat skirts with lots of embroidery, stylish cropped jackets, and an Empire-waist top with ribbon tie. The prairie never looked so good.</p></div>"
11,spring,2005,s2005,as-four,"When As Four first stormed the scene, it was hard to know what to make of this engaging gaggle of designers, with their spiral-leg trousers and fondness for lamé. With their spring collection, though, they showed more maturity than ever.</p><p>Their aim, designer Gabi said, was to be “generous—to open things up.” This show accomplished that, despite its excessive length. There was also plenty of humor, as seen in the “gotahaveballs” pieces—one example being a dress suspended from a necklace of charmeuse-wrapped balls. They even attacked the tank top to elegant effect—showing it as a big floaty circle in white jersey, worn with shorts, or as an easy top in nude silk charmeuse, with a trailing train of flowers. Ditto bathing suits and drop-dead dresses that could be worn as easily by an offbeat starlet like Christina Ricci as by a member of As Four’s eccentric style tribe.</p><p>What was most striking about the collection was the American feeling to it all. Their “bowraptinis” (read: rompers) were in the tradition of sportswear pioneer Claire McCardell, and Giorgio Sant’Angelo would have approved of their tunics. “We wanted to celebrate the easiness and movement of American dressing while keeping our identity,” Gabi said. Mission accomplished.</p></div>"
12,spring,2005,s2005,ashish,"Ashish Gupta is a surprise new entry to London Fashion Week: a graduate of Central Saint Martins equipped with a big, bright sense of humor. At a moment when many designers are solemnly setting themselves the task of making cheerful clothes, here comes Gupta with the genuine article. Call it Pop African with a sprinkling of Bollywood glitter. Then throw in a bit of vintage Americana, and you're nearly there.</p><p>Even that description isn't quite equal to the gold-and-green African scissor-printed trench that opened this show. Or the sequined, re-embroidered boleros and A-line shirts with their loud, jolly patterns of red fish or outsize flowers. Together with shiny metallic madras kilts, cartoony jogging suits, and spangled-up Minnie Mouse T-shirts, it adds up to a collection of young, accessible pieces with gorgeous production values.</p><p>Which is no wonder, when you consider the back story: Gupta was born in New Delhi, came to London to study, and now has his vibrant clothes hand-printed and re-embroidered in India. Part of multicultural Britain, and something to be proud of.</p></div>"
13,spring,2005,s2005,balenciaga,"Which to enthuse over first? The amazing flounced cocktail dresses, inspired by a 1958 Balenciaga original and given a fierce modernist chic by the addition of glossy crocodile cummerbunds and high gladiator sandals? The extraordinary gold-buttoned and braided naval jackets, paired with fluid, gorgeously easy sailor pants? Or the incredible glimmering, body-skimming Lesage-beaded jackets and coats?</p><p>Whatever the specifics of this superb show, the main point is that Nicolas Ghesquière has turned his hand to making ultra-classy, grown-up clothes. “I wanted it to be more dressy and expensive,” he said. “And I was inspired by volume and making things liquid.” Result: With its skinny gold-buttoned cardigan jackets and sexy spiral-zippered skirts, unlined blazers and the sort of light, flattering coat you can wear indoors, Balenciaga has navigated itself to a place sophisticated women will adore.</p><p>Any lingering questions about the potential breadth of Balenciaga’s appeal have now been settled. In the past, Ghesquière’s experimental cutting has been at the forefront, sometimes producing extremes that had the air of works in progress—and often overshadowed his equal interest in refining classic Parisian tailoring. Now, with the experiments kept in check, that side of his talent has sailed gloriously into view, producing a consummately balanced collection. The breakthrough seems to have been his decision to delve into the splendors of the Balenciaga archive—and to reabsorb the couture workmanship at his disposal (nimble-fingered lingerie makers for the dresses, Lesage for the beading). “It is true to the patrimony of the house,” Ghesquiere said. “And anyway, now I feel more mature.”</p></div>"
14,spring,2005,s2005,bcbg-max-azria,"""I'm undercover,"" declared the soundtrack for BCBG's spring runway show. Hopefully that's just idle thinking, because Max Azria's collection deserves some attention—particularly the first half, with embroidered skirts, smocked dresses, sequined tunics, and embellished coats that were folky, pretty, and perfectly on trend. The accessories hit, too; there was a great oversize bag, crochet and embroidered belts, and charm necklaces.</p><p>But it seemed Azria changed his mind right around the time the eveningwear appeared. Those rhinestone-embellished chiffon dresses in pastel colors had not one <em>mot</em> of peasant panache, but they're bound to delight Azria's starlet contingent. Quick switches like that make it easy to get lost in the vast BCBG universe, but this season the sporty separates will be easy—and fun—to navigate.</p></div>"
15,spring,2005,s2005,behnaz-sarafpour,"Holding a runway presentation on the main floor of Tiffany, early on a Sunday morning, invites a certain obvious comparison. So, Behnaz, was there a Holly Golightly spirit hovering above your spring collection? ""Honestly, I thought that might be a bit hokey,"" the designer said backstage after her lovely show. ""But I think a lot of people can relate to the idea of moving to New York, and creating a life here.""</p><p>With any luck, that life will include something from this collection. Sarafpour, a Vogue/CFDA Initiative finalist, merged her clean American-sportswear sensibility with fabrics that ranged from the obvious (crisp cotton shirtings) to the exotic (beautiful kimono brocades imported from Kyoto). She put her own stamp on pieces like princess-seam dresses and tailored jackets, by keeping them close to the body but never restrictively so, and she showed some of the season's prettiest full skirts, in lightweight, tie-dyed cotton. And, thanks to her sponsor, it was all accessorized with glints of Tiffany jewelry.</p><p>For evening, Sarafpour made a leap into red-carpet land with stunning black jersey column dresses trimmed with spangly gold paillettes. And as for that ghost of Golightly—Sarafpour summoned her via an impressive trench that came out in white, coral, and gleaming silver versions. The pattern, she said, was copied directly from the movie. ""My trench has been one of my best sellers since I started three years ago. This year, I did it as a kind of ode to Tiffany.""</p></div>"
16,spring,2005,s2005,bill-blass,"Big changes at Bill Blass this season. Gone were the drawn-out presentations and runway antics of the past two seasons, replaced by a briskly paced show whose models strode the catwalk at a businesslike clip. It made looking at the clothes much easier, and there was improvement there, as well—a trimmer silhouette, a little more skin, a lighter hand. But despite the improvement, the collection still hasn't found its soul.</p><p>Michael Vollbracht, now in his third season as Blass's creative director, opened with a lacy strapless sundress accented with a brown grosgrain ribbon—not earth-shattering, but certainly pretty. Such dresses were the collection's strength, from a demure white piqué A-line dress to refreshingly sexy bra-topped gowns. To his credit, Vollbracht has made Blass a regular on the red carpet in the past year, and this season's crop of telegenic eveningwear will certainly appeal to all-powerful celebrity stylists. But unless they're done young and tongue in cheek, those blocky wool crepe suits with prim cuffs and collars will come off more prissy than polished. Vollbracht is moving in the right direction, but a dose of unbridled passion would add a welcome edge to the house of Blass.</p></div>"
17,spring,2005,s2005,bottega-veneta,"Tomas Maier put an unexpected crimp in a trying day during Milan Fashion Week, choosing an inconvenient location and an odd organization for his Bottega Veneta presentation. As models strolled a continuous runway loop, the audience was expected to walk through taking notes—creating visibility problems and a general sense of confusion, for an already harried crowd.</p><p>Bottega Veneta is certainly not the first Italian leather-goods company to aim at building a ready-to-wear business, but this hybrid solution (was it a bag exhibition or a fully fledged fashion show?) didn't work. The bags, of course, are Meier's strongest suit. This season, the notable updates are gilded versions of the signature woven leathers and a red-and-white checkered bag on a red plastic chain. They were toted by models wearing Maier's idea of luxe sportswear for the superrich traveler. That means simple sportswear—beige raincoat, wide-leg pant, acid-yellow zipper top, and flats. Or beige jersey shirtdresses with a flare in the skirt. He jazzed that up by bringing in a gold leather blazer and coat, wrists full of gold bangles, and necklaces in the form of lanyards dangling gold hardware. Later in the parade, printed smocks, patchwork peasant dirndls, and blue-and-red sundresses appeared. Shown this way, it was hard to give Bottega's quality and detail the close inspection it deserves, much less understand the collection's coherence. That's a pity, and in the trajectory of this brand's success, it's something that needs to be resolved for next season.</p></div>"
18,spring,2005,s2005,boudicca,"Boudicca is one of the few labels that believes in something beyond the joy of seeing lovely clothes, and its shows are always intense, out-there spectacles—this one featured dark, defiant stomping through black cinders. But though designers Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby might flinch to hear it, it is simply the bold sophistication of their work that sets them head and shoulders above anyone else in London.</p><p>For spring, tailoring was razored to the ribs and strong in the shoulder. Voluminous white blouses had dramatic collars and asymmetric swagger. Chiffon dresses came devised with trailing scarves and panels of overlapping pleats that refused to obey the logic of a hemline. These are obsessions the couple has always harbored, and in their own Goth-minded way, they admitted this collection was a step toward consolidating the rock-solid identity the label needs in order to reach new markets. ""It was about the ghost of autumn 2004 haunting summer 2005,"" Broach said. Strip away the complex, tied-on extras, and underneath there's a collection of extraordinary pieces that, on a rail, will hold their own next to anything in Boudicca's home town—and beyond.</p></div>"
19,spring,2005,s2005,buddhist-punk,"Nicholas Morley could have played it safe for the debut of Buddhist Punk on the New York fashion calendar, but that's not his style. He chose to show on one of the biggest days of the week, and his raucous presentation at the Maritime Hotel became the unofficial big bang finale. Star studded, high volume, and patchouli infused, the show drew the likes of Patti Hansen, Steven Tyler, Andres Serrano, and Natalia Vodianova and Justin Portman. And Gina Gershon, Elizabeth Jagger, Veruschka, and the Richards girls walked, in an attempt to further Morley's stated aim for ""world domination.""</p><p>But what about the fashion? Well, Morley, an Australian hair-stylist-turned-designer who lives between London and Bali, is known for his T-shirts, first launched as a party promo in 1999. He's since developed projects with the Rolling Stones and AC/DC, and acquired a following along the way. This was a full collection with a rock 'n' roll/surf aesthetic: ""gnarly"" separates like silk-screened hoodies for men, and dresses, tunics, and women's bathing suits. These were tie-dyed, embroidered, and zebra striped, and could be worn as well by Shelly Zander (Marc Jacobs' athletic tattooed fit model) as by a St. Barts socialite looking for a little street cred.</p></div>"
20,spring,2005,s2005,burberry-prorsum,"Accolades go to Christopher Bailey for being one of those rare young designers who can orchestrate the components of a collection—clothes, accessories, brand identity—and infuse it all with a sense of lightness, as well as originality. At Burberry, he said, ""the whole thing is to look as if you've just thrown it on""—in other words, like Karen Elson as she breezed out with an airy pale-blue raincoat over a flowered dress: nonchalant, pretty, and very English in the bargain.</p><p>Those qualities played throughout the show—in the face-powder-pink leather trench, blue-and-white patchwork quilted linen skirts, fine-striped yellow-and-white knits, and even in the experimental volume of looped-up dresses. Behind all that seemingly casual ease, though, is an impressively thought-out sense of continuity.</p><p>Take Bailey's constant reinvention of the iconic trench: Now, it's a puff-sleeved smock. Or the way he always works in scarves—here, as feminine, wispy trails sometimes edged with pearls or a frill. Bailey makes sure to add in some Britishness; this season, with Wedgwood blue-and-white and Clarice Cliff Deco ceramics for print inspiration, and ""English spider"" brooches. To keep it from cloying, he tossed in some shiny techno fabric or a nutty pair of sixties sunglasses for fun.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""i31s46""></div></div><p>Burberry's bags looked pretty fantastic, too, like the chunky brown leather picnic bag, or a great new shoulder bag Bailey calls a ""sack,"" that ties in a bow at the shoulder. He's even reclaimed the famous beige-black-red check, in little leather-trimmed purses and totes.</p></div>"
21,spring,2005,s2005,calvin-klein-collection,"Francisco Costa is settling in at Calvin Klein. Taking over from an icon is an unenviable task, and the creative director has had a couple of bumpy moments in the past three seasons. But with this collection, Costa is moving in the right direction: continuing Klein's theme of simple, sensuous sportswear while putting his own stamp on the look.</p><p>But ""stamp"" might be too strong a word. Costa sent his dewy-browed models out to a soundtrack of plaintive acoustic pop, rather than the sometimes-jarring electronica or rap of yore. And the message was luxurious softness, from the fine knits worn atop lean skirts or pants cropped just above the ankle, to the fluid jerseys done in body-conscious dresses, to supple coats and jackets made from pale lambskin bonded to gray cotton knit.</p><p>Sometimes, it got a bit too soft; fashion is clearly loosening its look this season, but Costa veered into downright shapeless territory with some of the boxy tops and long jersey dresses. Odd colors popped up, too, like a Tropicana-bright orange jersey gown. But a fluttery scarf dress, and some of the color-blocked gowns he sent out at the end, looked just right. Costa has more to do to truly merge his sensibility with Klein's mammoth history, but this was his most confident outing yet.</p></div>"
22,spring,2005,s2005,carolina-herrera,"All it takes is one of Carolina Herrera's effervescent dresses fluttering down the runway, and suddenly, you're on the Riviera, with an icy cold drink, beneath blue skies. Spring is Herrera's season, and this year, her signature blend of sensuousness and sophistication seemed particularly lighthearted—inspired, perhaps, by her daughter Carolina Jr.'s lavish, romantic June wedding to the dashingly handsome Spanish bullfighter Miguel Baez? Regardless of the source, the benefits are available to all.</p><p>In addition to those floaty frocks—made from silk crepe or jersey, and cut to skim the body like a breeze—Herrera included plenty of sportswear to satisfy even the office-bound, like a tweed shift in nubbly red or camp shirts to wear with trim skirts. Always a fan of unexpected color combinations, Herrera (who designs with her daughter Patricia Lansing and design director Hervé Pierre Braillard) used deep hues of crimson, aqua, chocolate, and green against ivory and black. Herrera delights in details: A lovely lace dress was finished up the back with delightfully old-fashioned tiny pearl buttons, and chunky, gleaming jewels adorned straps and belts. This season, Herrera's all about sharing the love—and we're feeling it.</p></div>"
23,spring,2005,s2005,celine,"So it's adieu to Michael Kors, and <em>bonjour</em> to Roberto Menichetti, who takes the helm of Celine for the first time for spring 2005, bringing with him a wildly different aesthetic. If the Celine woman, courtesy of Kors, projected the image of worldly traveler with a private jet, Menichetti's heroine is shaping up to be the one designing the aerodynamics. There were no summer-weight furs, no jewels that looked like they'd been picked up during a few transcontinental jaunts, no precious exotic skins. Correction: There were a few of the latter, in the form of crocodile satchels worn like shoulder bags and tiny lizard purses sportily slung around the body.</p><p>The real change, of course, is that Celine has swapped Kors' American vision of sportswear for Menichetti's European one. It means that casual and often flamboyant luxury has been replaced with a far more sober and experimental vision. Menichetti pretty much stripped everything down to a wardrobe of streamlined and slightly futuristic basics: A-line coats, cocoon skirts, and boxy jackets. All of this came in a palette that looked like it might have been created in a laboratory, with saturated shades of fuchsia, citrine yellow, and lapis blue—an effect heightened by digitally manipulated floral prints.</p><p>Perhaps that was as far as the experiment should have gone: No woman needs a striped sweater with an odd circular cutout on the back, or tricky pleating on a skirt, or strange, space-age headbands. Menichetti's simplest offering—a white tank top and wide ivory herringbone tuxedo pants—is a far safer bet as a template for the new Celine.</p></div>"
24,spring,2005,s2005,chalayan,"However he got there—and we'll get to that later—Hussein Chalayan's spring collection demonstrated his extraordinary instinct for putting his clothes in the forefront of fashion. This season, without tripping on any conceptual stumbling blocks, Chalayan proved he belongs in the top tier of designers (including Jil Sander and Helmut Lang) who are formulating a breezy, easy-to-wear spring. That proposition includes man-tailored jackets, crisp blue-and-white pinstripe shirting, shorts, and soft, drifty dresses—and none of it has anything to do with ladylike retro.</p><p>Chalayan opened his show with a couple of sporty suits: a modernist tuxedo jacket over a vest and two-tiered skirt, and a pinstriped, softly bloused vest and cropped pants. From there, he made yet more attractively pragmatic pieces—lightweight raincoats and a hoodie cut from gray linen, worn with one of the best-cut pairs of slouchy, cuffed shorts seen this season.</p><p>Things got even more interesting when Chalayan brought in the striped cotton as simple shirttail dresses and little one-strap pinafore dresses worn under similarly patterned shirts. Then he transferred the pattern onto a loose (and surprisingly sexy) blue-and-white slinky knitted cardigan dress. By the time the lightweight coats, distinctly akin to men's dressing gowns, turned up, Chalayan's seasonal subtext had begun to emerge.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""2kqefx""></div></div><p>""I wanted to design as if I were a blind person,"" he explained later. ""And the only way I could imagine what it's like is to think of what you see when you're asleep and dreaming."" That accounted for the sleepwear, and also made some sense of the jumbled-up blue-and-orange prints of monsters and exotic birds that appeared on asymmetric chiffon dresses. Chalayan had a story for them, too: ""I blindfolded myself and drew at random, and then manipulated the shapes to make the dresses."" Does knowing its origin add anything profound to the collection? Maybe… maybe not. As with everything else, the true test of a collection isn't in the symbolism, but in the sheer, delightful want-ability. And there Chalayan passed, with honors.</p></div>"
25,spring,2005,s2005,chanel,"""Nicole!"" ""Nicole, over here!"" ""Baz!"" ""Nicole!"" ""Baz…!"" Nicole Kidman and Baz Luhrmann's entrance into the Chanel show, to a soundtrack of cries from the paparazzi, was as spectacularly theatrical as any of his movies. Kidman and Luhrmann were there in their capacity as star and director of Chanel's new advertising campaign for No. 5. But of course, Karl Lagerfeld couldn't resist adding a subtext to this event.</p><p>His runway was decked out with a red carpet—a witty nod to the one that Kidman walks in Luhrmann's ad. Moments later, superstars of another type—Linda Evangelista, Amber Valletta, Shalom Harlow, Naomi Campbell, Kristen McMenamy, and Nadja Auermann, all dressed in liquid black satin evening dress—began to walk the scarlet runner, while men ran alongside them popping flashbulbs. The message was clear: In an era when celebrity dressing has become so over exposed, it's only exciting when an actress has exceptional talent and style.</p><p>The whiff of Kidman's presence in this collection was as heady as the house's famous scent. Her petite shoulders and slim, lithe frame were made for Chanel's small, sculpted jackets, ankle-skimming skirts, and sinuous dresses. For those not blessed with the bones, there was also a wide range (perhaps too wide; the ideas came striding out in rapid succession) of wearable clothes that would work for, well, work. The classic tweed cardigan jacket with a little nip at its waist; a trenchcoat with an oversized houndstooth check; and spring's omnipresent gypsy skirt now chicly dressed up in the house's signature bouclé. The many evening looks were matched with flat jeweled sandals, a casual approach to nighttime dressing that's been a distinct presence in Paris.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""blysqf""></div></div><p>Amid this evening section, there was one true star: a black velvet column, with a low back and a fishtail hem, which would make the perfect foil for jewelry (and happens to be the dress Kidman wears in the ad). If you're in the market for a true stunner, you—and every celebrity stylist out there dressing the nation's actresses—would be well advised to let it take a leading role next spring.</p></div>"
26,spring,2005,s2005,charles-anastase,"What passes for hip among the_jeunesse dorée_ of Paris right now? Based on Charles Anastase's debut collection, it's a look that's pitched somewhere between Cyndi Lauper eighties (puffball miniskirts, cropped bomber jackets) and rave culture nineties (jacket emblazoned with an acid-house smiley face, straight-out-of-Goa tie-dye silk jumpsuits). Anastase also added in a dance theme, with crop leggings, tulle skirts, and satin ballet slippers—the latter continuing the short skirt with flats trend seen last week in Milan. The oddness of this esoteric mix was only heightened by the presentation itself, which included a trio composed of Anastase's sisters Kimbilly Nina and Tamara Anna and an artist friend, Fumiko. One played clarinet, another keyboards, and the third took the mic, occasionally giving herself the odd, desultory tap on the head to add a muffled beat to the music.</p><p>The question is, of course, what all of this added to the clothes. The answer: precisely nothing. Perhaps Anastase simply wanted to add some character to the proceedings—why else tie a china cup to the sleeve of a jacket?—but his collection worked best when he kept things straightforward and simple, such as the strappy evening dresses that closed the show. There's a lot of interest in the 25-year-old Anastase right now, partly because young French designers with potential are few and far between (no one has really come through since Nicolas Ghesquière), and partly because Anastase is a fashion illustrator of some repute. (He has drawn for A.P.C. and Calvin Klein, and a CD cover for Beck is in the works.) Yet the transition from drawing to designing is tricky: just look at Julie Verhoeven's short tenure at Gibo. For the time being, however, Anastase is worth watching.</p></div>"
27,spring,2005,s2005,chloe,"Phoebe Philo is hitting a spot that almost no one else manages to reach. Her unerring instinct for everything that's great to wear right now—and how to put it all together—has hit a groove of loose, effortless loveliness. And her spring collection could only be described as possessing the ineffable quality of ""It.""</p><p>Philo's deft handling of gently gathered washed-silk skirts, riding on the hip under tiny Victorian military jackets and worn with just the right high ankle-strap shoe, made complete, sexy sense of this season. When she sent out a cream silk plissé goddess dress, she made it so breezy and casual that it could just as easily appear on the street as at a party. Dealing out the frills, she undercut ladylike fuss with a cool simplicity—in, say, a soft, pleated bib-front blouse blowing over a tiered skirt, or, for a more boyish mood, slim tux pants with a black ruffled shirt-jacket.</p><p>When asked how she's making all this look so good, Philo—recently married and expecting her first baby in December—smiled and replied, with charming lack of designery grandeur: ""I'm just really happy at the moment, and I think that's when you do your best work."" But she's too modest. Her talent now fully blossomed, she knows exactly what to provide for any occasion in a young woman's life—whether that's dash-out-the-door practicality (a seersucker jacket and cuffed shorts, or a coat with military buttons) or unaffected evening gorgeousness (the draped green satin crystal-trimmed number that ended her show). With extra investment recently announced by parent company Richemont, this was a collection guaranteed to spread Chloé happiness round the world.</p></div>"
28,spring,2005,s2005,christian-dior,"Screeeeech! John Galliano opened his Christian Dior show with the sound of a car revving up and driving off. Was this indicative of a gear change at the house of Dior? While there has been praise lavished on the feats of imagination Galliano conjures for couture, the ready-to-wear hasn't hit the mark, of late. Recent collections have featured some—or more likely all—of the following: rubber fetish suits under evening dresses, scarily high S&amp;M platforms, and lamé rockabilly suits that looked made for a 400-pound Elvis impersonator, all topped off with makeup that was one part kabuki, one part Baby Jane Hudson.</p><p>Galliano changed tactics this season. This collection was a riposte to his critics: You want clothes? I'll give you clothes. And as if to underscore that his time at Dior has produced wearable pieces, he proceeded to revive most of them. There were the curvy suits, now recast in bouclé and denim, the Indian-embroidered bloused minidresses, the Tibetan fur vests, the anime/cartoon Dior-logo tees, and multiple variations on his trademark fluttery bias-cut dresses. And not one of the bags he showed with each and every look really stood out. Most looked mundane, minor reworkings of Dior's famous saddle style. In the end, this retrospective simply became retro—a mish-mash mix of old references masquerading as something new.</p><p>It's never easy to walk the line between runway and reality. Too much of the former and you're living in a dream world; too much of the latter and what's on the catwalk registers as routine. Galliano has navigated beautifully between those two territories before. He needs to do so again—otherwise he's simply speeding along on the road to nowhere.</p></div>"
29,spring,2005,s2005,christian-lacroix,"Perhaps all male designers who have spent years creating clothes for women reach a point where they suddenly think: OK, so what about me? What do I wear? Earlier in the day, Karl Lagerfeld had sent out a number of cool men's suits and sweaters for Chanel (though it seems that those clothes were destined for the runway only). Christian Lacroix, on the other hand, is intent on making menswear a crucial part of his label, which isn't a bad thing: The Savile Row-goes-Rive Gauche suits, bright, exotically patterned shirts, and safari bomber jackets he showed were pretty darn snappy.</p><p>It's not all about personal satisfaction, though. Nowadays, designers have to multitask like crazy, turning their hand to all the various product categories that compose your average multinational luxury brand. That's why Lacroix put such an emphasis on accessories this season. There were vertiginously high sparkly disco sandals, gargantuan rhinestone brooches pinned hither and thither, and quite an array of bags, most of which came in his trademark textiles, such as toile du Jouy, or made-for-Ibiza painterly swirls and splodges.</p><p>All this aside, a designer still has to be able to deliver on the fashion front. The best pieces in Lacroix's show were the little fitted jackets, which have emerged as the kind of piece that everyone is going to want. His came in crisp black and white toile du Jouy, passementerie-embroidered blue silk, and a nubbly white, turquoise, and black tweed. He also showed a few in a slightly oversized, borrowed-from-the-boys style, which would be perfect thrown over his white broderie anglaise gypsy skirts.</p></div>"
30,spring,2005,s2005,clements-ribeiro,"There are times when inspirational program notes can put you off a show before it even starts. As, for example, when Clements Ribeiro wrote, ""We have never been to India,"" in the notes for their spring presentation, which they apparently wove together by dreaming up an Edwardian lady botanist/explorer who ""got stuck in India"" on her travels. Turned out, however, that this intelligence contributed only a minimal insight into the clothes on the runway.</p><p>Without a sari or a bustle in sight, this was essentially just another episode in the development of the striped cashmere sweaters and loose decorative dresses on which Clements Ribeiro have built their reputation. Putting aside the high-concept storytelling, it's possible to see how skilled this husband-and-wife team are at steering their look in the seasonal direction. Now, with forties printed dresses, bunchily pleated washed-brocade skirts, and crewel-work appliquéd tops, they're sailing along somewhere in the same waters as Prada and Marni—but with splashes of vivid color all their own. In addition, the couple have added ballast to their steadily growing business with the addition of a shoe line—gutsy platforms and wedges that give creative vent to Suzanne Clements' mania for footwear—and a relaunched collection of bags.</p></div>"
31,spring,2005,s2005,comme-des-garcons,"Take a huge, rough-hewn biker jacket, lash the seams with crude saddle stitching, and put it atop a delicate <em>Swan Lake</em>-worthy tutu. That was the startling collision of disparate elements at Comme des Garçons. “I thought about the power of the motorbike—the machine itself—and the strength of a ballet dancer’s arms,” Rei Kawakubo said. In other words, another chapter (Hell’s Ballerinas, perhaps?) in her career-long philosophical investigation into women and strength.</p><p>Kawakubo’s explanation clarified why the dancers’ stiff leather or neoprene jackets were cut with rolled-up sleeves, and how their openwork inserts mimicked the cooler vents in a motorcycle engine, and why curviform foam-rubber seat-covers sometimes morphed into skirts. Done in black, tan, or orange, the jackets had the heft of a truly cool idea and made a strangely beautiful contrast with the fragile pinks and whites of the tutus.</p><p>Perhaps this collection was commenting on the resources a modern woman needs—speed, toughness, and rigorous self-discipline, for example. (Plus the wisdom of a judge, if that’s what Kawakubo meant by those wacky powdered wigs.) Deep readings apart, there were certainly a couple of lovely, and pertinent, superficials: patent ballet flats and the bird-inspired feathery decorations on a couple of dance skirts.</p></div>"
32,spring,2005,s2005,costume-national,"Costume National presents an interesting case study in the evolution of an image. Normally this involves the tricky transition from ultrahip label to fashion mainstream. Some designers occasionally return to their avant-garde roots to reclaim past glories; others meander along, each new collection sadly a case of diminishing returns. There is another way, though: Simply stick to what you're known and loved for, but work in some more au courant ideas, so that your designs signal <em>now</em>. If that approach works, you may no longer be white hot, but you'll have dedicated followers who return time and time again.</p><p>That's the line of thinking that Costume National's Ennio Capasa follows. For next spring, Capasa still believes in slickly tailored trenchcoats, biker jackets, and straight skirts, but he has polished them with safari-suit detailing (buttoned pockets and wooden-buckle belts) and African-style adornments (appliquéd strips of black-and-red patent leather that run along the seams, emphasizing the second-skin fit of his clothes). There were times when the theme was heavy-handed: Capasa's use of traditional Masai necklaces as straps on evening dresses looked cumbersome. It was when he introduced a softer, easier element—a long suede djellaba-esque dress under a safari jacket, say—to temper the more overtly sexual moments that the show fell into step with fashion's current direction.</p></div>"
33,spring,2005,s2005,d-g,"How clever of Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana to hit on young Elvis Presley in his <em>Blue Hawaii</em> phase as a perfectly topical, tropical setting for their secondary line's spring season. It let them work in fashion's current crush on the fifties, loads of loud South Sea prints, and jeans—alongside the usual girly sexy dresses and boyish pantsuits.</p><p>The D&amp;G girls came out with ratted bouffants and an assortment of Hawaiian-print jersey dresses and T-shirts photo-printed with Elvis, over raffia skirts or provocative swimwear. Their ""boyfriends"" swaggered alongside, sporting quiffs, lean suits, and winkle pickers. It was a smart device for bringing all the main line's signatures to a younger market—and lots of fun in the bargain.</p></div>"
34,spring,2005,s2005,daryl-k,"Through her ups and downs, Daryl Kerrigan has never strayed from the downtown aesthetic that makes her a favorite of models and those reedy, grungy girls who always date musicians. For her third season back after a two-year hiatus, Kerrigan did a bare-bones spring presentation that included plenty of her regular themes: miniskirts, slouchy skinny pants stacked atop spray-painted boots, draped jersey tops that can be made asymmetric with drawstrings or buttons (and double as minidresses, for the lean and brave). No surprises there. What caught the eye was a dress with a curtainlike hem in a print that looked like a tattoo version of toile de Jouy, and the designer's ""Zulu cowboy"" pieces: hand-painted cotton separates with bold graphics that fit right in with the week's primitive trend and showed she's willing to step outside her comfortable niche.</p></div>"
35,spring,2005,s2005,derek-lam,"Derek Lam set the mood for his lovely spring collection with the first song: Bette Midler's soulful version of ""Do You Want to Dance?"" It's the kind of bittersweet ballad that put the audience into a wistful, romantic frame of mind—just where Lam wanted them.</p><p>The designer (a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Initiative finalist) took as his inspiration the torrid affair Helmut Newton had in Singapore with Josette, an older Belgian woman, just before World War II. The silhouettes—calf-length, flowing skirts, a slightly emphasized shoulder, a true waist defined by big belts—certainly recalled that era, as did Lam's use of muted colors, fluttery georgette crepe de chine, and lace.</p><p>The overall impression was that any of these looks—flowing ruffled chiffon tea gowns and tiered, polka dot Empire gowns, loose but tailored trousers, soft blouses that tied at the neck—could have come from the closet of a sophisticated European exile. But Lam made it modern with smart looks like high-waisted ""coolie"" jackets, slim pencil skirts, and a crimson floral print done on a light wrap coat. Soft, drifty evening skirts and gowns in subtle color combinations like chocolate and violet are certain to set hearts beating faster.</p></div>"
36,spring,2005,s2005,diane-von-furstenberg,"In the past few seasons, this collection drifted a bit from its identity, with excessive retro references and extraneous detailing obscuring Diane von Furstenberg's strength: chic, sexy clothes for a smart, worldly woman. Ironically, it was a travel theme that brought DVF back home: Spring's collection, designed by von Furstenberg and creative director Nathan Jendon, based on the idea of a grand tour, was bold, breezy, and focused.</p><p>The show opened with a simple, straightforward outfit: a cotton safari shirt and a pair of the slim shorts that have emerged as a major trend. Von Furstenberg added a glam touch by fashioning them in chocolate satin that would suit urban explorers as well as globetrotters. Plenty of sportswear followed, enriched with hippie flair: chiffon tops, gored skirts that fluttered around the calves (some trimmed with strands of jingly coins), schoolboy blazers jazzed up with bright colors and beading, and lots of those deservedly famous slim wrap dresses in a variety of prints. And summery dresses were rendered in soft cotton voile with a bright giant leaf print—the perfect thing to wear to a welcome-back party.</p></div>"
37,spring,2005,s2005,dkny,"""This is the way people should see clothes,"" said Donna Karan, as she surveyed the happy crowd milling on a sunny Sunday morning through Pastis. Karan took over the Meatpacking District hot spot to showcase her DKNY spring collection in situ, as it were; the perennially trendy bistro is precisely where her customer would want to flaunt these urban-hipster looks.</p><p>Instead of looking to reinvent the wheel with DKNY, Karan is more interested in playing with street trends like vintage, layering, and rule breaking (sequins for day, khaki for night, stilettos at noon, and so on). So the refurbished vintage mannequins installed around the restaurant wore silk georgette dresses with sequin belts, embroidered linen coats with tank tops and cropped jeans, snug little jackets over long jersey camisoles and knee-length linen skirts, and slouchy silk off-the-shoulder blouses over narrow cotton shorts. It all had the kind of throw-it-on cool a fashion stylist might achieve after much patient digging through thrift store bins and racks; Karan's talent is that she makes it accessible to those who are style-ambitious but time-starved. Or, as she puts it, ""It's friendly. It's the way New Yorkers dress today. Everything goes with a pair of jeans.""</p></div>"
38,spring,2005,s2005,dolce-gabbana,"By a poignant coincidence, the news of Richard Avedon's death reached Milan just as Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were referencing the great photographer's work for their spring collection. ""Avedon for the beauty, and Penn for Africa,"" said Gabbana, gesturing toward a collage of seventies glamazons (Iman, Kelly LeBrock, Lauren Hutton, Rosie Vela, and Brooke Shields) torn from <em>Vogue</em> and pinned on the wall backstage.</p><p>Their key image must surely have been that famous photo of the naked Nastassja Kinski entwined with a snake. There was scarcely a single outfit in the entire collection that didn't involve python. It began with Naomi Campbell in a reptilian corset dress, with arms and neck full of tribal-deluxe metal jewelry simultaneously signaling Africa. That idea progressed into a vast continent of python-smothered outfits, from trenchcoats to Coco-esque jackets to jeans and evening gowns, not to mention boots, bangles, and minibags that swung from every available belt loop.</p><p>In their African theme, Dolce &amp; Gabbana also struck on the current Milanese taste for raffia fringe and feathers (quail fluff on a blouson, exotic green plumes as a skirt, quills to create a hip-slung mini.) Along the way, they managed to work in their personal penchant for lingerie, inserting lace into denim and splicing it into the kick-pleats of a python skirt. There was the occasional signature pantsuit (now with a puff-sleeved jacket) and, of course, the usual tableau of major evening gowns for a grand finale.</p></div>"
39,spring,2005,s2005,donna-karan,"Twenty years ago, Donna Karan revolutionized fashion by proving that power and sensuousness aren't mutually exclusive. True to that, reconciling opposites has been one of her career strengths; who else can seduce executive women into fitted cashmere jackets and chunky African jewelry? But in her spring collection, Karan's usually masterful blend turned cacophonous.</p><p>The rich, confident suits, supple knits, and great jerseys that would work so well with this season's trend for softness and ease were nowhere to be found. Instead, Karan focused on severely tailored wool pieces, strangely inset with athletic mesh panels and often laced up the back, corset-style. Some of her colors, like royal blue and fuchsia, were jarring, especially in bulky leather jackets whose strategic cutouts reprised her famous ""cold shoulder"" dress from the mid-nineties.</p><p>Karan's theme song—Diane Reeves' ""Endangered Species,"" with its lyrics proclaiming, ""I am a woman and an artist""—had a modern-earth-goddess message that ran counter to the boned bodices, stiff fabrics, and industrial-looking silver jewelry by Robert Lee Morris. A gifted, intuitive tailor, Karan again displayed impeccable fit throughout. She knows just where to cut a sleeve, how much a crisp poplin shirt should hug the torso, or how to make a jacket that sits perfectly on the hips. And some of her draped and ruched dresses yearned for a breeze to set them fluttering. Karan called her collection Constructing the Future, and her desire to break new ground is admirable—but hopefully that won't be at the expense of her remarkable past.</p></div>"
40,spring,2005,s2005,doo-ri,"""I love doing spring,"" said Doo-Ri Chung. ""I feel so much lighter."" Chung, a Geoffrey Beene alumna and CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Initiative finalist, showed her strengths—architectural draping of silk and jersey—for her fourth collection. But this time, she expanded on those qualities by introducing lace and net (materials she had never worked with before), as well as a custom feather print courtesy of her friend, artist Wook Kim. The new additions gave Chung's designs a welcome airiness.</p><p>The minimal, light space of the Peter White Studio was an ideal setting for the fluid dresses and flirty skirts, rendered this season in coral, sand, sky, teal, and pink. Especially successful were a pink jersey and silk print dress, and a teal silk halter dress with lace. A few open backs, including one on a sky jersey V-neck dress, added a beachy, tanned flair. And the music, by Detroit DJ Scott Zacharias—a jazz, New Age, and bossa nova mix—contributed to the clothes' smooth Zen vibe.</p></div>"
41,spring,2005,s2005,dries-van-noten,"The party that Dries Van Noten threw to celebrate his 50th collection was a modest little affair: a chandelier-lit dinner for 500 at a cavernous factory on the outskirts of Paris. The guests were seated on either side of an ultralong table and were attended by 250 waiters (one to every two guests—now that’s service!) who set down the dishes in finely choreographed formation. Once the <em>poisson en papillote</em> had been cleared away, the table became the runway for the evening’s main event: the showing of the spring collection.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine that anything Van Noten could do would live up to all that fanfare. But it did—and then some. What he showed—voluminous skirts, floral prints, Indian beading, crewelwork embroideries, white shirts, Bermuda shorts, flat shoes—might seem like a roll call of spring’s most pertinent trends. But in fact, Van Noten has been doing all of this for years—and this collection contained some of his most sophisticated work to date. Particularly stunning were the prints, which looked like old tapestries that had been screen-printed onto washed-cotton or crisp linen full skirts and sundresses.</p><p>But if the current fashion moment belongs to Van Noten, the real charm of this designer is that he probably couldn’t care less about it. He has carved a niche for himself as someone who is committed to making clothes that are intimate and individual, and which don't come with a set of rigid rules about how they should be worn. Just how much of a personal connection he can make became clear at the end of the show, when trays were lowered from the ceiling, bearing a signed scrapbook of his last 50 collections for every member of the audience. Tucked inside each one was a Polaroid of the chandelier under which they sat. It all served to further illuminate what a rare talent he is.</p></div>"
42,spring,2005,s2005,dsquared,"Dean and Dan Caten, the Canadian-Italian twins behind Dsquared², are shamelessly intent on filling the high-octane sex, fun, and vulgarity vacuum that has appeared in Milan lately. They invited their audience to an ersatz house party, where a series of competitively undressed girls got down with a posse of buff guys. Hot tub included, naturally.</p><p>The device allowed the twins to sample genres at will, from hot-as-hell denim to Studio 54 tux pantsuits to flash-it-all jersey gowns. It's all been done before, many times and in more-sophisticated forms, at Versace, Gucci, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. What made this forgivable, though, was the real thought beneath all that pastiche. The Catens have put their mark on enough pieces now to qualify as brand builders. One is their low-riding cropped jean with its signature cut; this season, that appeared in a leather Western-stitched version. Then there are the great sporty jackets, too, like one pieced together from brown cotton drill and lime and black nylon. And occasionally, there's an entirely new twist on a basic. Right on time for the season's Eastern trend, they've grown a gray hoodie into a floor-length Indian caftan. That's genius.</p></div>"
43,spring,2005,s2005,eley-kishimoto,"Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto called their spring collection ""local,"" and used their Brixton neighborhood as the inspiration for an Afro-Caribbean-flavored show—a bit of a trend in London this season. The focus was on batik-like prints in eye-popping colors (one incorporated tower blocks from the street on which they live), with one motif also used for the wall coverings against which the usual mad mix of patterns was being shown. The boldest prints were the highlights; less successful were the Western-inspired pieces and the jogging jackets, which looked like leftovers from the team's new collaboration with Ellesse.</p><p>From a business perspective, this collection represented an important step forward for Eley Kishimoto. The duo has just signed a licensing deal with an Italian company, meaning production will no longer be mom-and-pop-style—nor local.</p></div>"
44,spring,2005,s2005,eleykishimoto-ellesse,"What would London Fashion Week be without the excitement of a Rolling Stone daughter or two? Jade, Lizzy, and Leah have all done their part in seasons past, but now it's time to make way for the Richards girls, Theodora and Alexandra. For the launch of Eleykishimoto Ellesse, the teen sisters were up there on the podium, striking silly pretend-tennis, pretend-sexy poses for all they were worth, in a matching pair of turquoise-and-white printed cotton playsuits.</p><p>Naïvely colorful and quite obviously unserious in its sporting intentions, this new line is a collaboration between London's Welsh-Japanese husband-and-wife team and the Ellesse brand. With its red-and-white striped jersey shorts, printed handkerchief tops, multicolored shorty cotton smocks, and zippy jackets, the line looked more reminiscent of eighties calendar girls than Olympian sportswomen.</p><p>That, said Mark Eley, was exactly the point. ""We had a free rein, and we thought we'd leave the technical sportswear to people who can do it properly,"" he said. ""Ellesse to us is a nostalgia thing. It meant seeing Bjorn Borg at Wimbledon, or sunny girls in St. Tropez, who go to the tennis club—but who only do lunch.""</p></div>"
45,spring,2005,s2005,emanuel-ungaro,"You would think, what with next Spring shaping up to be all about tiered gypsy skirts, ethnic handcrafted jewels, and prints, prints, prints galore, that this would be Emanuel Ungaro's season. As I say: You would think. Alas, it is not to be.</p><p>Ungaro designer Giambattista Valli may have conceived his Spring collection as an odyssey to the Greek Isles, but it quickly became apparent that we were all at (the Aegean) sea. Valli touched on pretty much every element of Greek culture: the white shirts and full, layered skirts that are part of the country's traditional national dress; huge togalike rope belts knotted around the waist of oversized chiffon ponchos and tourniquet-tight pants; and Grecian-draped dresses—a strong trend in Paris, but not terribly well executed here. Just in case we'd missed the point, all of this was paraded out to the sound of 1,001 balalaikas madly strumming away.</p><p>The Ungaro look now seems stuck in a rut, and is simply not moving on. Those tight crop pants, for example, have appeared in just about every collection that Valli has designed for the house. … and still there are no takers. Another sticking point: The show was so skewed toward the Young Hollywood set, with its unquenchable thirst for eveningwear, that there was virtually nothing here in the way of day clothes. For the final look, Valli sent model Missy Rayder out in a dress with a billowing underskirt, which she dramatically removed to reveal a shorter, far simpler dress. The house of Ungaro needs a few better tricks up its sleeve than that if it's going to work its magic again.</p></div>"
46,spring,2005,s2005,emilio-pucci,"""<em>Je suis realiste; c'est moi. Je ne suis pas fou</em>"" (""I'm not crazy. I'm a realist""), declared Salvador Dalí (implausibly) over the soundtrack of Christian Lacroix's latest adventure into Pucciworld—clearly a metaphor for the soberest collection he has produced for the house to date.</p><p>As the show opened with elegantly understated separates that mixed solid color—fuschia, purple, and the swimming-pool blue that is fast emerging as the hue of the season—with over-scaled print, Lacroix seemed to be signaling a reality check after the flamboyance of his debut at Pucci. He embraced the key pieces of a season strong on mismatched separates—shorts both micro and surf-length, the shrunken cardigan, the tiered gypsy skirt—before a slow build to the fantasy we have come to expect of his brilliant magpie mind.</p><p>Eyelet cotton, embroidered with tone-on-tone white-work in swirling Pucci patterns, was inset with vivid silk patchwork for <em>gitane</em> skirts and little tops pretty as paper doilies. For evening, tiny sixties shift or A-line swing dresses—one with a feather-frond bib, another with a faux necklace—looked perfect for a night at Caesars Palace with a latter-day Rat Packer. There was even a brace of solid-color chiffon evening gowns whose elaboration of cut and finesse of construction struck a chord with Marie Seznec, the dramatically gray-haired <em>directrice</em> of Lacroix's own-name haute couture house, making her debut in the Pucci front row.</p></div>"
47,spring,2005,s2005,emma-cook,"After a season's rest from the runway, Emma Cook has re-emerged with a collection that looks fresh, but also several degrees more grown-up and polished. Her delicate shell-pink draped jersey dress, cinched with a silver metal ivy-leaf belt, made a sweet, clean opener at a show staged in the Royal Academy of Arts. (Striving to win attention for young talent, London Fashion Week has chosen some new, very classy central locations, rather than leaving audiences to scrabble for novelty in the dingy back-street venues of the East End.)</p><p>Cook, though, is not the newest of the new, and that's all to the better. This is her eighth season since leaving Central Saint Martins, and she's had time to develop a girlish, though not unbearably cute, personality with some original twists. That comes through in the way she might add a detail of a knotted hemline in a soft tulip skirt, or scatter a vaguely Art Nouveau print of foliage, moths, and birds on a white lawn pinafore.</p><p>In a season when pretty dresses and femininity are so ubiquitous, Cook did well to avoid retro referencing and clichéd frilliness. She leavened her look with a few cropped sweats and wide-leg cuffed pants that hit an attractively practical note. There were a couple of odder notions (jersey jumpsuits with baggy bottoms, anyone?), but for the most part, this small collection hit a good note.</p></div>"
48,spring,2005,s2005,emporio-armani,"Any fashion mogul worth his empire has his sights set on Asia, and Giorgio Armani is no exception. He's spent a good chunk of the past year exploring that part of the world, where boom sales are being predicted for luxury brands like his. That explains why India was on his mind for Emporio Armani. ""I think it's the next place we will go,"" he said, referring to an expansion plan that follows his recent boutique openings in China.</p><p>The subcontinental drift was the keynote for a collection that filtered elements of raj-meets-ethnic costume through his highly recognizable Italian sensibility. The positive was that he took a relaxed point of view, using light, crinkled, sometimes metallic fabrics from a washed-out palette of white, beige, ivory, and dusty gray. That, allied to a sensitivity toward curvy, gentle shapes, gave a believably contemporary edge to his body-hugging jackets, which come with petallike peplums, as fluted boleros, wispy blousons, and—as always in an Emporio show—in many, many other airs—or ragas, as the case may be.</p><p>All these summery pieces will live easily with today's pick-and-mix fashion attitudes. Below the waist, though, it's more complicated. The Indian theme led to thoughts of polo, meaning jodhpurs and puttees. The former came in parachute silk, the latter in everything from beige bindings to, eventually, casings of black leather for evening. Occasionally, there was a diversion into handkerchief-point skirts over harem pants. Suffice it to say, in a woman's world, extraneous flights of creativity in pants, whatever the theme, are better kept grounded.</p></div>"
49,spring,2005,s2005,etro,"In a season when India is inspiring so many collections, Etro—which uses a paisley print as its brand identity—is more entitled than most to roam the subcontinent. Sure enough, that's where the collection went, but via the seventies hippie route. That meant a combination of canvas patchwork sparkled up with dangling-coin embellishment (on a shorts suit and coat) and drifty, diaphanous printed fabrics, sometimes crinkled and pleated (for romantic dresses and smock tops.)</p><p>Some of these colorful pieces were luxuriously attractive. One of the standouts—which could make a lovely entrance at any party—was a long, flowing seventies-style dress with belled sleeves, detailed with pinwheel pleating in the Empire bodice. The neo-flower child might also consider dipping into the butterfly sleeve, Zandra Rhodes-type elements of the collection—the tiny vests and soft plissé, floor-sweeping peasant dirndls.</p><p>As always, however, with shopping the one-world market, it's a question of picking and choosing. Sometimes, there is only a sliver of a difference between the ""I've been to Goa"" fashion statement and the one that's already available for $30 at the Portobello Road market.</p></div>"
50,spring,2005,s2005,fashion-fringe,"It was, in a way, rather touching (and perhaps inevitable) that London's newest young-designer initiative should end up feeling just like the old days—mammoth boozy party in a multistory car park, loud contingents of gate-crashing fashion students, and a group of recent graduates' clothes on the runway.</p><p>But this is the twenty-first century, not the <em>Ab Fab</em> eighties, and the event was Fashion Fringe, the culmination of a nationwide competition to find the next generation of talent, instigated by veteran London <em>Sunday Times</em> critic Colin McDowell. Fearing a decline in the excitement about London fashion—not to mention the perennial lack of funding—he corralled serious sponsorship from Red Bull and others, and wound up with £10,000 to bestow on the winner.</p><p>In the event, a panel including Burberry CEO Rose Marie Bravo, British <em>Vogue</em> editor Alexandra Schulman, Hamish Bowles of American <em>Vogue</em>, and Giles Deacon chose the showstopper of the evening as winner—a collection by Basso &amp; Brooke with hugely inflated leg-o'-mutton shoulders, nipped-in waists, and draped pants, all smothered in kitsch yellow-brown-green seventies prints. There were inevitable comparisons with Giles Deacon himself, not to mention a scintilla of Viktor &amp; Rolf.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""5irrjk""></div></div><p>Other contenders, like Sinhastanic, displayed more than a passing resemblance to Rick Owens in their raw-edged leather and drapey jersey shapes; Rubecksen Yamanaka, meanwhile, is already in business. It all added up to something both infuriating and funny that, if McDowell has anything to do with it, will become an annual event.</p></div>"
51,spring,2005,s2005,fendi,"Karl Lagerfeld turned his Fendi collection into a statement about print, color, and jersey dressing. He worked two separate palettes simultaneously—one a slew of rich, muddy, purplish darks, the other, rainbow streaks of acid yellows, electric blues, and greens—for everything from swimwear to vaguely forties day dresses to long, slender, scarflike gowns.</p><p>Fendi's famous furs got the same painterly treatment, in multicolored fluffy cardigans and hippie deluxe perforated-fur vests. The house's new Spy bag, designed with secret pockets to stash lipsticks, sunglasses, cash, and cell phones, showed up in variations ranging from Deco-patterned velvet evening clutches to oversize brown squashy leathers.</p><p>The collection looked best when Lagerfeld turned his attention to the possibilities of a new, longer length—a trend that's emerging strongly. Backstage, for those still puzzled about his color palette, the designer said that he was inspired by a recent exhibition of work by the Spanish painter Joan Miró.</p></div>"
52,spring,2005,s2005,gardem,"In its mission to establish itself as launch pad of young design, London is rolling out the welcome mat for international talent. The first arrival, with a little help from the British Fashion Council, is Garen Demerdjian, the 29-year-old Lebanon-born, Paris-based designer whose Gardem label has been stirring up the independent-boutique crowd for several seasons.</p><p>Gardem takes a gentle, feminine approach to post-deconstructionism. Using light layers of brown crinkled silk, washed leather, fine cotton, and gray sweatshirting, Demerdjian creates easy pieces meant for do-it-yourself assemblages. He showed various combinations of pedal pushers, multi-fabric fluted skirts, patchwork dresses, bolero vests, abbreviated biker jackets, and sweet smocked peasant blouses, all with a drifty, cool attitude. That, of course, makes Gardem a member of the Rick Owens/Ann Demeulemeester tribe of rockin' fashion grunge—but, interestingly, without the angst. Demerdjian needs to edit: Half the numbers would have doubled his show's impact. But as a debut, it hit the mark.</p></div>"
53,spring,2005,s2005,giles-deacon,"Watching Giles Deacon's show—headlined by Linda Evangelista, Karolina Kurkova, Eugenia Volodina, and Karen Elson—while glancing at the haute-couture-style program notes (""pheasant feather pencil skirt, jasper pendant""), you had to pinch yourself to remember that this was only a young designer's second collection. This is London, after all, where spotting a supermodel on a runway is about as rare as sighting a unicorn in Hyde Park.</p><p>For all the hype surrounding Deacon, it's still too early to say whether or not he's really going anywhere. He may have earned local raves for his seventies-suburban-ladylike vibe, but hardline critics find it impossible to imagine what woman could possibly wear those jazzily striped jacquard suits with the matching 6-inch wedges. Or find an occasion equal to one of his flowing printed scarf dresses or electric-blue sunray-pleated dinner gowns. Some might mutter, too, about the overtones of Vivienne Westwood tailoring—not to mention a smidge of Jean Muir here and quite a lot of pure Stepford Wife cheese there.</p><p>On the other hand, there's enough that is genuinely odd in Deacon's aesthetic to make it almost grotesquely fascinating. He has a small boy's interest in animals and insects, which crop up in motifs of apes, bees, scorpions, and lizards, or outsize marquetry plaques, which he fashions into vast pendants or bags. All of which provides a certain unsettling undercurrent to the pseudo-glam pastiche. That may not be a bad thing in a season of too much normality. But the jury's still out.</p></div>"
54,spring,2005,s2005,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani has spoken recently about the creative frustration of keeping his design within the rigid, straight-and-narrow confines of commercial expectation. Perhaps that's why he chose two eccentrically mismatched inspirations for spring—Elsa Schiaparelli and chinoiserie—and dubbed the collection Shocking.</p><p>The bizarre effects came most obviously in strange straw turbans, coolie hats, and sparkly surrealist bug pins. Though he opened with a relatively muted beige jacket and a long silk skirt curved up in front, Armani's thought process then veered into variations on Chinese silk pajamas, interspersed with sparkly tiered dresses, hoop-skirted mermaid gowns, and a silk-tasseled fringed bodice.</p><p>The sequencing of the show, if not exactly shocking—from evening to day, and back again—certainly provided some unexpected jolts. Sometimes, however, giving the audience what it wants turns out to be the best policy. Armani did exactly that with a posse of white beaded gowns—precisely the kind of clean glamour his Hollywood faithful require.</p></div>"
55,spring,2005,s2005,gucci,"How weird, exciting, and unimaginably stressful it must have been for Alessandra Facchinetti to send out her first collection for Gucci. In the very same high-gloss venue so recently and dramatically vacated by Tom Ford, this was the evening on which the 32-year-old understudy had to take her first steps as an ingénue—all in the glare of worldwide publicity, and under the weight of immense corporate and creative expectations.</p><p>In the event, Facchinetti didn't veer very far from the Ford formula. Her opening look, a dusty-brown safari jacket cinched over a form-hugging fringed and tasseled woven skirt, gave a hint of her seasonal theme: a touch Indian, but transformed into a statement of Italianate sexuality. What followed—the brick-red crocodile cutaway fashion-rocker jackets; corseted bustiers; skinny pants; clinging, highly worked opaque/sheer paneled dresses; and skimpily provocative Swarovski-jeweled backless pieces—clearly carried the same stamp as Ford-era design, if not quite moving at the same adrenalin-surging pace.</p><p>So what had the assistant been contributing, and what was the master's responsibility? That's an issue that can only be clarified over time. At present, it's enough to ask of Facchinetti and her co-workers that they show a pragmatic ability to keep a mega-brand going. That they did—though the fact that this collection is now being directed from a female-led Milanese design room (relocated from Ford's London base) is certain to make a difference of some kind.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""finvps""></div></div><p>Meanwhile, another debutante was showing her hand this evening: Frida Giannini, the young woman responsible for designing the great bags, shoes, belts, and sunglasses that came down the runway. Because accessories are the foundation of Gucci's global success, the highly desirable velvet, leather, and gold-enamel-studded Pelham bag deserves at least an equal share of the limelight.</p></div>"
56,spring,2005,s2005,helmut-lang,"“It's just about optimal summer,” said a relaxed Helmut Lang backstage before his show. “You’ll see sailor elements, and ropes and knots. But you know, we’re never literal.” Right enough: The collection had a tangential relationship to nautical style, without going overboard.</p><p>The first impression to come across was one of lightness—in the plain striped canvas ticking and shirting fabrics that Lang cut into jackets, belted coats, narrow pants, and shift dresses. Beyond that were his signature personal twists. A blue-and-white cotton shirt-striped dress came with a swooping neckline and a folded-back detail, buttoned like matelot pants in the skirt. Jackets were cut short, and shaped like a midshipman’s uniform—the best, in navy, had a sailor collar and was worn with a trailing asymmetric white jersey tank and chinos.</p><p>And the ropes and knots? There were gorgeous platform espadrilles in tan, black, and white; twists and knots of fabric were worked into short dresses, suspended or draped across the body like abstract garlands; and evening decoration included string-and-pearl harnesses.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""h4ygnm""></div></div><p>True to the designer’s promise, nothing in this collection was overly themey. But elegance and simplicity are the strongest points of Lang’s aesthetic, and those are the qualities that looked most compelling in this collection.</p></div>"
57,spring,2005,s2005,imitation-of-christ,"For the first time, Tara Subkoff headed for the tents to show her Imitation and Imitation of Christ collections. While the venue was way more traditional than her usual offbeat locales, those who came for the spectacle were treated to as offbeat a show as ever: It opened with men in military garb and Arab tunics walking double file in the dark, while footage from the Iraq war played on a screen behind. Four American flags hung over the audience. Antony, from Antony and the Johnsons, played piano and sang, wearing half drag. A child recited the Pledge of Allegiance. And a disturbingly accurate George W. Bush impersonator sat in the front row. Asked what her message was, Subkoff answered: ""I think it's pretty obvious.""</p><p>It says a lot about the clothes that they were able to withstand such loaded packaging. Subkoff's collections are more and more about wearable separates, with no vintage in sight. This season her simple Capris, hoodies, pompom cover-ups, and spangle-trimmed dresses were as appealing as ever, worn with the insouciant slouch of the disenfranchised hipster—and the gladiator sandals Subkoff designed for Easy Spirit.</p><p>The second half of the show featured the Imitation of Christ line, handmade garments that will be available through Jeanne Greenberg Rohaytn's Upper East Side gallery. These exotic goddess looks were stately and pretty at once: Of particular interest were a simple silver pleated dress worn by Ujjwala, and an elegant draped, embroidered shawl. With their intricate pleats and folds, these pieces were clearly related to Subkoff's participation in the <em>PREMAculTURE</em> exhibition on the island of Hydra, Greece.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""druew""></div></div><p>Whatever antics Subkoff indulges in, she also adheres to her vision—a strong modern woman, not unlike her friend Chloë Sevigny, who sat front row. ""I'm very excited to see Tara evolve,"" said the actress post-show. She's not alone.</p></div>"
58,spring,2005,s2005,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel, the designer whose fresh take on luxe pelts has made him a favorite of the young and chic, wants to apply his talents to the wide world of ready-to-wear. But what's a furrier to do when the weather turns warm? Without his familiar territory to fall back on, Mendel's developing design skills moved front and center.</p><p>He started out strong, with a creamy tweed coat picked apart at the edges and put over a powder-pink chiffon coat. That shredded-edge motif showed up throughout, as a means of breaking up Mendel's rich, polished aesthetic. He understands his customer: The season's trends (face-powder colors, full skirts, fluttery soft fabrics) were all present and accounted for, and delightfully accented with charm bracelets from his sponsor, Piaget.</p><p>Mendel has a sense for the unexpected; a plunge-neck coral satin dress over a hand-painted petticoat added a delightful color burst. Mendel even managed to sneak in a bit of fur, in a sable collar on a tiny little jacket, or a goat-fur jacket made with his signature, elaborate piecing. But Mendel undercut his strengths by overloading the embellishment—when one outfit has sequins <em>and</em> pintucks <em>and</em> rose quartz trim, the eye doesn't know where to go first. If he could tone things down just a bit, we'd all be the richer for it.</p></div>"
59,spring,2005,s2005,jean-paul-gaultier,"You know you're in Paris when the models smoke not only backstage, they're encouraged to do it on the runway, too. At Jean Paul Gaultier's spring show, the runway was clouded by smoke from the clove cigarettes the models brandished with all the élan of your average nicotine addict. It wasn't particularly surprising; Gaultier has never shied from provocative. But that was as rebellious as he got: The butt, as it were, stopped here. What Gaultier did do was present one of his best collections of recent times, rich in wonderfully sharp, sexy tailoring and the kind of wit and whimsy he has made his own.</p><p>Essentially, this was a culture clash, with those recognizably Gaultier elements—nip-waisted jackets, trenchcoats, narrow pencil skirts—thrown over or under flamenco-refrained ruffled and tiered skirts and dresses that swept the floor. (In a season of many tiered skirts, Gaultier has done some of the best.) What made it all so appealing was its polish; it was as if Gaultier had finally managed to effortlessly integrate his haute couture work (not to mention this fall's debut Hermès collection) into his eponymous label. That showed through in some of the more straightforward moments, such as the masterly color combination of a tangerine blazer over an emerald blouse and a pink pencil skirt, or the expert cut of a brown leather bomber jacket, which was pulled tight against the body, and then fell into folds down the front.</p></div>"
60,spring,2005,s2005,jeffrey-chow,"Although his program notes claimed inspiration from Africa, Jeffrey Chow's spring show—with cropped cardigans worn over Bermuda shorts, Empire-line coats, and high-waist pencil skirts—seemed equally indebted to a preppy but slightly boho coed, circa 1968. Sometimes, those influences gelled beautifully, as in the ivory strapless silk dress with African-inspired embroidery, worn with a matching collar (perfect for the anthropology department's spring fling!). But more often, Chow seemed content simply to tweak classics like tuxedo shirts, tailored trousers, and flowing dresses made from chiffon and jersey.</p><p>Chow has an imaginative sense of color and fabric that can lead to some inspired results. White cotton eyelet, made into a knee-length skirt or paired with a floaty, pleated, Swarovski-crystal-embroidered black skirt, took on a fresh smartness, while his black-and-white organza bubble dress gave new life to an old cliché. But raw silk—not one of fashion's sexier fabrics to begin with—doesn't exactly win prizes when it's dyed tricky colors like teal, coral, and scarlet. If Chow can steer clear of such clunkers, he won't need to go so far afield for inspiration.</p></div>"
61,spring,2005,s2005,jil-sander,"Just when it seemed clothes couldn't get any more complicated, Jil Sander came along with a collection that blew away the fuss like a clean spring breeze. Take her opening look: a white jacket with a blue roller-print marking on the front, tucked into a cream pencil skirt, and worn with flats. Boring? Not at all—more like artistic simplicity. It takes world-class talent to give the elements of every day—shirts, blazers, pants, raincoats—a good name in the fashion book.</p><p>Normal clothes like these haven't had much attention since Helmut Lang, Miuccia Prada, and Sander herself defined nineties minimalism. Now she's doing it again, but this time with color, surface decoration, a relaxed sense of femininity, and none of her earlier tendency to abstruse abstraction. What woman wouldn't fall for a taupe trench, slightly A-line, with a couple of big chic brass buttons? Or a frilled shirt, a flattering pair of wide cuffed pants, a one-button jacket brilliantly cut in turquoise? You'd hardly expect frills in this formerly austere environment, but Sander added softness (say, a scarf tied in a bow) and turned one of her beloved techno-fabrics (an ultra-luxurious neo-taffeta) into a small-waisted weightless white coat with a tulle skirt sticking out beneath the oval skirt.</p><p>Sander gave the trend toward ethnic influence a glance with an ikat-like computerized placement print, but there was no sense that she was leaning heavily on a theme. Interesting, light-handed sportswear is enough for her—and in overwrought times like these, that looks like a breakthrough.</p></div>"
62,spring,2005,s2005,jill-stuart,"At first, something different seemed to be in the air at Jill Stuart this season. Nicky Hilton in the front row. Stuart taking her bow with Bijou Phillips. And an essentially one-song soundtrack—that rocker classic ""Stairway to Heaven."" But all those hints didn't really lead to any big surprises. The show featured long-haired girls in vintage-looking dresses cut in thirties silhouettes, body-hugging jackets (this season paired with bloomer-style shorts), and wonderful bathing suits with a forties flair.</p><p>Each season, Stuart plays with embellishment and accessories to update her shapes. She was on trend with her use of smocking and pleats, wooden wedges, and groovy belts worn at the natural waistline, but her decorative motifs—running from metal studs to a star-printed fabric, to Carmen Miranda fruit charms, to appliquéd pieced-cotton flowers on denim and chiffon—were less focused. The strongest pieces, as usual, were her dresses, like a belted polka dot number with a keyhole neckline. And putting chiffon dresses over lamé bathing suits is a clever way to deal with transparency, as well as the right thing to wear to a pool party.</p></div>"
63,spring,2005,s2005,john-galliano,"What was John Galliano thinking about as he conjured up his spring 2005 collection? Here's what: Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton, one of the most iconic society figures of twentieth century America, meets Sienna Miller, It girl Brit actress starring in the twenty-first century remake of sixties film <em>Alfie</em>. Where? At England's legendary Glastonbury Festival. What did they do? Rocked out, into the wee hours, to a soundtrack of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,"" ""Good Vibrations,"" and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit.""</p><p>All over the place? Yes, but this is Galliano's modus operandi: to layer disparate reference upon disparate reference, then top off the lot with some very playful, inventive accessories. The strategy stretches right back to his time in London in the eighties, where strips of twig, smashed eyeglasses, and even some fish all turned up—memorably—on the runway. This time round, Galliano must have hit Toys ""R"" Us for the kids' balloons that trailed behind the models and the inflatable plastic pool toys that were worn as hats. Yet there were more ""serious"" accessories here, too: Bollywood-worthy fake-flower cuffs and necklaces; slouchy sequin knit hats, the likes of which you'd never have seen on any Seattle grungester in the nineties; and fur used for thong-tied flat boots—an unexpected, and highly effective, counterpoint to the more extravagantly glamorous evening looks.</p><p>What to wear to this strange, fabulous party? How about the Schiaparelli-esque gold lamé fitted jacket, with enormous folds of fabric dramatically draped onto the shoulder, or a gem-studded, tiny-waisted ombré chiffon ball dress (the Hutton influence)? Perhaps you'd prefer a shiny, swirling, hallucinogenic floral coat, or a lime-green ruffled dress with a psychedelic cartoon-print scarf trailing off the shoulders (for a Miller moment).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""72fina""></div></div><p>Either way, with all this going on, there's no need for Galliano's usual heavy, theatrical makeup. Just let your face go naked, let down your hair, and… party!</p></div>"
64,spring,2005,s2005,jonathan-saunders,"In a season when fashion is loving prints (especially the retro floral variety), there's a window open for designers who can do something absolutely new and surprising with pattern—especially if it involves a lovely dress or two. Jonathan Saunders, at 26, is jumping at that opportunity with a collection that took its cue, he said, from the Bauhaus movement.</p><p>Sound grim? The stark geometry of the classic German art-house aesthetic normally looks better on furniture and posters than clothes. Mercifully, however, Saunders is not a literalist. He melded bold lines, circles, and a palette of monochromes, teal, blue, orange, and yellow into shapes—simple tanks and fluted skirts, to start with—that flatter the body. His optical effects—in printing, burnt-out, or intarsia knit—may be technically impressive, but the clever part is the way he combines them with a feel for sexy wearability.</p><p>Learning from his mistakes of last season—a rewind to severe eighties power-dressing—Saunders went back to fluidity for his finale. That produced a sequence of floor-sweeping looks that came across as great options for young red-carpet dressing.</p></div>"
65,spring,2005,s2005,junya-watanabe,"There was something deliberately rough-and-ready about the way Junya Watanabe knocked together raw-edged ruffled cotton blouses and peasant dirndls, and hammered on zippers and snaps in place of decoration in his spring collection. ""Like the huts in Dover Street Market"" was his gnomic explanation. That reference—if it helps—is to the shantytown shacks installed by Watanabe's mentor, Rei Kawakubo, in Comme des Garçons' new London department store.</p><p>Though Watanabe might have been aiming at the impression of spontaneous, artistic use of humble materials, there was plenty of complexity—and an eye for current trends—to be found. The deeply encrusted gold zipper necklines and patches of silver snaps on vests and boleros were distant relatives of the widespread Asiatic folk-embroidery tribe. Long, gathered skirts, cream lace, and poet sleeves were perfectly in step with themes that are cropping up all over this season.</p><p>What's particularly personal is Watanabe's romanticism, and his persistent use of those dippy frayed edges. Can't hold it against him, though: After all, this is the man who, two winters ago, originated ragged-edged tweed—a trend that went mega, at every possible level, this year. Not surprisingly, then, audiences tend to cling to Watanabe's every thread for novel ideas. Though this collection didn't wield the seismic potential of a few winters ago, it had a charm all its own.</p></div>"
66,spring,2005,s2005,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Unlike most designers, who go into neutral on any topic other than fashion, Kenneth Cole's political views are at the heart of his company—in his ads, his marketing, even at his runway shows, where he starts every presentation with a short film full of tongue-in-cheek social commentary.</p><p>Would that Cole had as strong a point of view when it comes to fashion. His spring collection was made up of clean, straightforward, but essentially anonymous takes on current trends—pencil skirts, cropped bomber jackets, knit tops, seamed jersey dresses. There's a need and a place for those clothes, but the runway demands a designer who can tell a story, even if it's just a twisted classic. Cole may be passionate about hot-button issues, but we have yet to see that depth of feeling show up on the catwalk.</p></div>"
67,spring,2005,s2005,lagerfeld-gallery,"The art of dressing the runway is serious business in Paris. Leave New York to its simple and straightforward white—all the better to play the supporting role of blank canvas. Here, they're always trying out new materials for the models to traverse: a gasoline slick, a layer of sand, or, as happened this season at Lagerfeld Gallery, silver glitter on a midnight-black floor.</p><p>More importantly, though, did Karl Lagerfeld's collection itself sparkle? There were certainly shining moments. The multitasking Monsieur Lagerfeld hasn't totally abandoned the androgyny theme he has been exploring for several seasons: There were sweeping fedoras, starched wing collars on dresses, and skinny smokings with supertight pants. But the majority of these pieces were much softer (bloused and pleated dresses), brighter (a palette of hot pink, pale lavender, and buttercup yellow amid the monochrome), and lighter (skirts atop stiffened petticoats, a recurring trend here) than other Lagerfeld Gallery offerings of late. That was particularly true of the evening looks that closed the show. The same wispy, wonderful, weightless quality Lagerfeld injects into his furs for Fendi, or his cardigan jackets for Chanel, came through beautifully in a series of silk dresses slipped over sweeping gauze underskirts.</p></div>"
68,spring,2005,s2005,lanvin,"Lanvin designer Alber Elbaz can turn even a broken wrist that prevented him from sketching to creative advantage. ""In the studio I found I could only make big gestures to describe what I wanted,"" he said. ""And that turned into all this volume and weightlessness."" The results included generous skirts and puffy silhouettes, drenched in exquisite hues ranging from intense violet through sophisticated neutrals—a beautifully shaded demonstration of Elbaz's growing insight into how <em>lovely</em> can also mean <em>realistic</em>.</p><p>Let's face it: A full skirt is not, under normal circumstances, easy on the hip. Elbaz sorted that out by running his silk faille and gazar through the washing machine—a transformation that eliminated the dreaded bulk and put air in a gather, bounce in a flounce. He also makes things simple to put on, as evidenced by the sleeveless mauve dress that blossomed below the waist, or the trench cut to swing out in a glorious swirl.</p><p>Still can't go there? No worries. Elbaz also knows how to do slim, chiefly by way of Greek pleats—either along the lines of Madame Grès' refined, ribbon-bound couture version or, with brilliant freshness, the flowy rivulets of Mariano Fortuny's tunics. Bless him for making them as easy to pull on as a T-shirt.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4pikr9""></div></div><p>Decoration? He's thought of that, too. There were strands of pearl tied up in ribbon or studded with blue stones, and coin or brass-bobble embellishment applied to jackets or integrated into shirts—fancy stuff, but made totally today. Which precisely summed up the talent that brought this designer such a roar of appreciation at the end of his show.</p></div>"
69,spring,2005,s2005,lela-rose,"Lela Rose showed real development in her latest, sophisticated collection. A favorite of well-heeled private clients, this transplanted Texan has gathered some impressive buzz lately, courtesy of her clients the Bush twins. And the clothes Rose showed in the comfy confines of Christie's would clearly delight any first daughter, or even a first lady—regardless of party affiliation.</p><p>Rose struck an ideal balance between dressy and casual by pairing a white beaded tank with a lacy skirt, and an embroidered top with a full, swingy, ochre skirt. More formal was a white terry cloth suit with a trumpet skirt, and a stunning coat of the same fabric. For evening, there were slip-like dresses and styles with sleek bustier tops, as well as the requisite big-night-out gown with some pouf, all shown atop Rickard Shah shoes.</p></div>"
70,spring,2005,s2005,louis-vuitton,"Sometimes, it's a bit of a challenge to work out just what's going on among the frenetic kaleidoscope of color, this-meets-that styling, the girly bag-swinging, and the melee of celebrity action that make up a Louis Vuitton show. Christina Ricci, the week's second Hollywood actress on a Paris runway (she's starring in Vuitton's house ads, like Nicole Kidman at Chanel), opened the show in a little black forties suit with a sparkling peplum. Pharrell Williams was in the house, too, wearing a pair of the red-plastic-framed shades he's designed for Vuitton. Takashi Murakami, a seasoned hit maker, was present by way of a cherry-print bag that flashed at the sides of the spangled circle skirts and shivery crepe de chine retro-flowered dresses.</p><p>Not surprising then, that this carnival of multidirectional brand projection was based, in part, on the big top. Marc Jacobs and his team had been looking at circus photos from the forties, which explains the colored sequin trims sprinkled among the puff-sleeved, tight-bodiced silhouettes. Then again, Jacobs also said he was inspired by the vintage clothes the model Querelle wears to her go-sees. He can't stand being tied down by too many literal stories, though. ""I like hybrids,"" he shrugged. ""And you know, it's just about having fun with clothes.""</p><p>Which should be easy with this pick-and-mix variety show. Take the white peplum suits, bustle-frilled skirts, and dresses with Peter Pan collars or garlands of fabric flowers. Or go a crazier route, with neckpieces of fake flowers or collars of bright Lucite to throw the forties thrift store look off a notch. Logo lovers will get their fix from ""LV""-printed pedal pusher jeans, cardigans patchworked with denim pockets, and of course, matching bags. Some of those were jeweled, or knitted and crocheted in Lurex to echo the flash of the clothes. Something for everyone—and not to worry too much about linear coherence. At the end of the day, what pulls everything together at Louis Vuitton is the way Marc Jacobs makes it sell.</p></div>"
71,spring,2005,s2005,luca-luca,"Is Luca Orlandi the new P. Diddy? Maybe not quite—but his spring show certainly qualified as a media circus, packed to the rafters and including his favorite starlets (Mischa Barton, Jessica Simpson). But if the crowd was expecting the forthrightly sexy clothes that have been the focus of Orlandi's past two collections, they came to the wrong show. The only nasty action came via DJ Javier Peral, who played songs like ""Diablo,"" ""Dirty, Dirty,"" and ""Money, Money, Money"" (the ""Bad Ass Strippa"" version, no less).</p><p>For his part, Orlandi delivered a pretty, pastel-colored collection that returned to his roots. The show opened with an innocent bow-tied beige linen jacket; a lovely linen dress with an overlay of lace and ribbon continued the theme. Tweed jackets in Easter egg colors were worn with flowing full pants and finely gauged knits underneath. And heavily, sometimes overly embellished pieces—petal dresses and beaded and embroidered lace skirts—were reminiscent of fifties Italian design. But, as the finale dresses (made of linen dress, polka dot cotton, and white organza) proved, Orlandi's collection was a modern take on sweetness.</p></div>"
72,spring,2005,s2005,luella,"Luella Bartley's woman doesn't just walk. She strides, and occasionally stomps and stamps. In other words, she's got a righteous dose of rock 'n' roll attitude fueling her every move, and the wardrobe to make it work.</p><p>Bartley started her spring collection with a dose of the classics, done her way: full-leg trousers slouching low on the hips, a crisp oversize shirt tucked into tiny shorts, a kilt cut short enough to qualify as a belt, a skinny polo dress worn with a claw necklace, and of course, a pair of her superskinny jeans with a schoolboy blazer patterned in her trademark apple print. The colors started out in country club neutrals like white, navy, and khaki, with some doses of kelly green and bright blue. It wasn't too long, of course, before Bartley turned to her own classics: more of those skinny trousers and blousy men's shirts, now in hot colors (orange, pink, lime), plus lightly flounced minidresses, wild python motorcycle jackets (worn, for example, over a minuscule bikini), and lots of her covetable handbags—all shown atop high-heel spectator pumps perfect for announcing your arrival.</p></div>"
73,spring,2005,s2005,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"It's easy to think that Marc by Marc Jacobs, the designer's popular secondary label, is a playground compared to his intensely focused, heavily scrutinized main collection. All the layering, wrapping, and oddball oppositions of color and pattern give the line a charismatic, ""Hey, let's try this!"" spontaneity. Of course, a Marc by Marc show is also calculated hodgepodge; there are precious few women who could assemble, much less pull off, this girlish, pile-it-on aesthetic. But then again, the runway is for make believe, and at least for a few moments, Jacobs can fill it however he likes.</p><p>His pop culture reference this season was the mid-eighties, when New Romantic groups like Bow Wow Wow and the World Famous Supreme Team wore oversize worker's clothes with multicultural hippie touches like embroidery, crisscrossed sashes, and patchwork. Jacobs used plenty of color and played off soft indigo jeans and shorts (often held up with chunky leather belts). He sent out a rock-steady crew's worth of soft tops and loose, floaty dresses in a variety of retro-feeling prints, and showed trench coats cut as full as a ball gown. Great pieces came out thick and fast, as Grandmaster Flash played in the background; in fact, sometimes the array went from dazzling to dizzying. Would it be nice if he dropped two or three pieces from each outfit to give us a better look at all those ideas? Yes—but then it wouldn't be Marc.</p></div>"
74,spring,2005,s2005,marc-jacobs,"Jennifer Lopez, Lil' Kim, Steven Tyler and daughter Liv, Perry Farrell, Kate Hudson, a few off-duty models, and <em>both</em> Olsen twins. Marc Jacobs may have the most exciting front row of New York's Fashion Week, but he doesn't let it distract him from the work at hand—as his electric Spring collection proved.</p><p>Jacobs sent out supersaturated, eye-delighting tones like parrot blue, azure, yellow, hot pink, and royal purple, often in the same outfit. With his irrefutable confidence, Jacobs can make colors that might ordinarily be at odds seem perfectly natural and a perfectly chic combination; an azure cardigan with a deep-navy brocade skirt, or a navy and white polka dot cardigan over fuchsia trousers. And in a season of hues that sometimes border on the anemic, it felt like a trip to the tropics.</p><p>Jacobs put those shades to work in first-rate sportswear that's destined to influence the look of the streets next spring. He showed extra-full trousers worn low with wide white belts, rolled to mid-calf and paired with teetering spectator pumps. Those, and the swirly, swinging skirts, were balanced on top with boxy jackets and coats, or skinny little knits layered in various color and pattern combinations. His dresses, which hung loose from the shoulders and barely grazed the body on the way down, were shaped with meandering seams and often worn atop fluffy petticoats. And for those party moments, he reprised the shredded-and-stitched organza ruffle dresses of last year, this time decorated so densely they looked like the plumage of a bird of paradise.</p></div>"
75,spring,2005,s2005,marni,"With her country-fresh pink cheeks, bird's-nest hair, and enviably serene smile, the Marni girl projects an easy, all's-well-with-the-world outlook. Step over her threshold, and you're in a place of slightly batty loveliness, where clothes have the touching resonance of sunny days, and getting dressed seems like a series of happy accidents.</p><p>Designer Consuelo Castiglioni picked up her spring vibe from a couple of handcrafty, nostalgic artifacts: a Hessian place mat naïvely appliquéd with birds found in Portobello market and a bright-green flower-printed cotton sixties swimsuit from the L.A. vintage store Jet Rag. She teased out the essence of those oddly contrasting artifacts and wove it in to her existing passion for fifties kitchen-curtain prints, mattress stripes, and glitter-shot fabric.</p><p>Result: a collection of pretty egg-shaped skirts, Empire sundresses, duster coats, and shrunken knits, often pulled together with sparkly belts or a humble piece of string. The Hessian table mat turned up as a burlap, birdie-embroidered skirt, and the swimsuit pattern in cheerful printed terry boleros and frocks. Castiglioni also made her first excursion into eveningwear, in bunchy pearl-gray taffeta dresses. As with everything else in this collection, they were charm personified.</p></div>"
76,spring,2005,s2005,martin-grant,"When Martin Grant is on form, he can perk up an audience no end. Channeling his considerable experience as a private dressmaker turned ready-to-wear designer, Grant produces clothes that are nicely poised between daintiness and practicality—neither debutante froth nor overblown runway fantasy. His spring collection was triggered, he said, by an artist's smock hanging in his studio. ""It was about smocking, gathers, and volumes,"" he said. ""But only vaguely.""</p><p>He opened with a delicate, forties-feeling pale-pink dress, followed by a curvy rose-colored short jacket over a full, delicately striped knee-length skirt. That was followed by a beautifully simple white linen dress whose gathered bodice clung to the waist and opened into a gentle fullness below—something between innocent peasant and Empress Josephine.</p><p>All this ably demonstrated his understanding of summer's lightness and romance. But Grant isn't one to get swept away by a theme. He also wisely developed some of the signature pieces so beloved by his clients (like Lee Radziwill, discreetly watching from the sidelines). Grant's neatly useful coats looked particularly great—for example, a trench with a new trumpet-sleeve detail or a black yoked painter's coat shrugged over a liquid-silver flounced skirt.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""niu2gp""></div></div><p>Grant's sophisticated nighttime looks demonstrated how thoroughly he's thought about an area many others don't: making an evening dress that is stunning in 3-D. The Empire line and smock idea became raised-waist dresses bloused at the back, handled elegantly in rich silver and platinum fabrics that never turned vulgar. That kind of reality chic explains why Grant is garnering such a loyal following.</p></div>"
77,spring,2005,s2005,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson never lets his fans down, generally because they always know what to expect—there are rarely surprises to be found at his shows. True to that, his loyalists are sure to embrace his spring collection, called Beyond the Horizon. He set a pretty stage, with a backdrop of clouds by photographer Sanchita Islam and a front row that included Damon Dash, Amy Sacco, and Plum Sykes. But as a whole, the collection came out somewhat scattered, running from tattoo prints to nautical looks to fluorescent highlights.</p><p>That hot-hued palette worked best on a sporty striped sweater, but less well on see-through blouses worn with Daisy Dukes. His print of the season—rainbows with metallic stars—was kitschy, but cute in a seventies way. The strongest items were his fit-and-flare dresses, executed with rich peasant touches like smocking and embroidery. A tattoo-print muslin smock dress was also done well, and a gold lamé corset dress should soon show up on a red carpet near you.</p></div>"
78,spring,2005,s2005,max-mara,"Under normal circumstances, MaxMara is a dependable collection in which women seek those most useful, yet maddeningly hard-to-find elements: a jacket or coat with classic dash or—rarest of rare resources—a fantastically cut pair of pants. For Spring, the house design team started off in a promising, safari-inspired direction. Dashing taupe trenches, and heavy-linen bush jackets with a nice drape to them, will go down excellently with that chic, grown-up audience whose route <em>Out of Africa</em> leads via Saint Laurent.</p><p>There was a fresh seasonal appeal, too, in the nice contrast between gutsy leaf prints and pretty eyelet elements. But what horror transpired in the MaxMara pant department? Everyone knows the label's trousers are a strength at retail. But, at the very moment when an amazingly tailored man's pant is nearing the top of every woman's most-desired list, the house decided to go with… diapers. Quite what could have possessed the designers to commit to this shape, in everything from skirts with an under-loop of fabric to droopy jersey jumpsuits to evening gowns with a floor-dragging crotch, is beyond inexplicable.</p><p>Oh, well. At an early-morning show, the bizarre parade did at least raise a rare communal round of international laughter in the auditorium.</p></div>"
79,spring,2005,s2005,menichetti,"Roberto Menichetti has a varied history, including a Burberry stint, and he's about to start as the designer for Celine. Last season, he unveiled his own line at a small presentation, but decided to amp it up for spring with a formal runway show. The collection was brightly colored: Menichetti successfully paired kelly and lime greens, persimmon and tomato reds, teals and grays. He did so particularly well on a deep-orange gown with blue-gray back panels and tails.</p><p>The designer demonstrated his technical skill with draped tops and dresses that fell open like origami, and his love for technologically advanced fabrics showed in a flock print (based on his logo), applied with high-frequency thermal pressure, and leather cut to resemble eyelet. But the collection stumbled in the details, like the cufflinks used to hold pleats and drapes throughout, the filmy breast-baring tops suspended with delicate chains, and the excess of lacing. All that busyness detracted from the otherwise elegant proportions.</p></div>"
80,spring,2005,s2005,michael-kors-collection,"For such an archetypal American designer, Michael Kors draws plenty of inspiration from the great European resorts: Capri, St. Tropez, Portofino. This spring, it was Mykonos and Santorini, where one can imagine the idle jet set of both genders strolling through the local market wearing not much more than a bikini and a breezy tunic.</p><p>As the soundtrack bounced from one cheery, cheesy Top 40 hit to another (like a rental-car radio being twiddled by a restless, but well dressed, passenger), Kors sent out a clean, commercially viable collection. There were equatorially bright shades of blue, lime green, and orange, exotic animal prints like tiger and python, and high-end bits like rich glittery brocade and the occasional fur or leather topper. The island feeling came through in crisp white pieces and embroidered tunics. And there were skimpy bathing suits aplenty, for women and men alike. One male model sported a nylon number so brief, editors compared him to Times Square's naked singing cowboy, while another model wore his with a cigar—a nod to Kors' owner, Laurence Stroll.</p><p>Balancing the simple and the luxurious is Kors' driving principle, and there were plenty of multitasking pieces: little cashmere cardigans to wear over a bikini or evening dress, for example, or silky jersey dresses that won't wrinkle when they're smushed into a suitcase. And the draped-chiffon goddess gowns that closed the show would look equally great on seaside terrace or red carpet. But Kors' collections, while always polished, have become as smooth as a moonlight sail—and that's too bad. It would be nice to see Kors break out in a bold new direction. Next season, how about a trip to Atlantic City?</p></div>"
81,spring,2005,s2005,miguel-adrover,"Miguel Adrover’s spring/fall 2005 collection started out like gangbusters, right from the first look—a navy suit tailored with the precision for which he’s known. That was followed by more classic suitings and then two lovely gowns, one in a woolly windowpane, another in ribboned chiffon. The show could have stopped there; Adrover, in about five looks, had demonstrated his talent. But the show went on—and on, and on, for almost 90 more looks.</p><p>It’s not that he didn’t have a story to tell; this season, the narrative-loving designer explored the glories of the Old West, from the cowboys and Indians, the beauty of native craft, even the cost of imperialism, and put it on the runway with a powerful (if excessively long) fusion of design, styling, and music. Adrover has always been passionate about his craft, experimenting with odd materials and unexpected volume, and this season he showed that skill in an expertly balanced quilt-front skirt, and a smocked and pleated gingham dress. He can also do straight sportswear—as seen in the totem suits, duster coats, and trenches. But just as the show wound down, the designer himself walked out in a T-shirt printed with “Anyone see a backer?”, and the thread of the tale was broken. As much as he embraces American culture, Adrover’s always positioned himself as an outsider with no desire to play the fashion game; with talent like his, let’s hope there’s a happy ending in his future.</p></div>"
82,spring,2005,s2005,missoni,"To the coolest Coldplay soundtrack, Angela Missoni sent out her prettiest collection to date—with her daughter Margherita, eschewing the front row to sit cross-legged on the floor, clearly in the role of muse. Wearing a fluttering thirties-inspired chiffon frock, electric-blue satin high heels, and a necklace of turquoise beads with purse to match, the 21-year-old exemplified the charming, eclectic feel of her mother's show.</p><p>Missoni played with a delectable fruit theme, from a palette of apple green, banana, and watermelon, to fruit appliqués on skinny knit cardigans and tank tops, through crochet choker necklaces and garland belts. There was even a playful nod to Judith Leiber, in the form of a sparkling, green apple evening purse.</p><p>In the spirit of the season, everything was part of a thrift-inspired mix. Boho combinations included a skinny-rib melon cardigan shrugged over a thirties chiffon garden-party dress, its elaborate seams traced with metallic knit; a cropped jacket worn with a flirty skirt, its jacquard godets in a contrasting color; and a crochet camisole top over the first Missoni jeans—in strawberry or vanilla, as well as French navy. With an M picked out in stitching on a back pocket, the pieces from this denim range, which includes microshorts, well-fitting seventies-flavor jeans, and shapely flying jackets, look set to figure high on any fashionista's must-have list.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tc03dj""></div></div><p>Missoni captured the lightness and fragility of this thistledown spring, with Maypole-striped pieces, free-flying panels, and even fringed evening separates and dresses. Seen en masse, as the models took to the runway for their finale, they suggested the flutter of a cloud of butterflies descending on a ripening orchard.</p></div>"
83,spring,2005,s2005,miu-miu,"It was short (hemline-wise), sweet, and unencumbered with any responsibility for changing the direction of fashion. And that's just the way Miu Miu, Prada's secondary line, ought to stand in relation to its older, more intellectual sister collection. For spring, the younger sibling has gone crazy over early seventies geometric prints—either the brown and beige patterns typical of English charity-shop coffee sets, or Marimekko-style florals in purple, blue, and red.</p><p>What Miu Miu might lack in its limited message—it was all fresh faces, orange lipstick, and girlish cheerfulness—it makes up for in breadth of stock. Waffle knits turned up as Empire-line sweater dresses, while checked shirts became tiny dresses, tied under the bust with knitted belts. The shoes—long, low Mary Janes or high stalking pumps, in orange and emerald—chimed perfectly with the bright, colorful patents that have been turning up as flashes of sixties moderne all over Milan.</p><p>As simple and carefree as all this may seem, Miuccia Prada is also being careful to pass her best-selling ideas on to Miu Miu for another season's enjoyment. Her jewelry-as-embellishment idea is now manifest, at a more accessible price, in the encrusted beaded necklines on dresses and in the panels applied to shantung jackets. All proof that Ms. Prada is a natural fashion democrat.</p></div>"
84,spring,2005,s2005,monique-lhuillier,"Monique Lhuillier has classic tastes: She loves a tweed jacket, a floral print, a frothy, frilly gown—and she does them well. It's no surprise, then, that her spring show contained all of these elements—but against her chosen theme of California dreaming, Lhuillier's own strengths looked out of place.</p><p>The white linen jean pants and coat that opened the show, as well as the tropical-print bathing suits and cover-ups, conveyed the beachy message. But things got downright confusing when lace and tweed were paired with safari-esque khaki (not very California) and when multi-tiered gowns in Laura Ashley-like florals shared the runway with beautifully minimal examples, like a stunning asymmetric pleated bias number. The problem here was that Lhuillier's theme didn't play to her best qualities. Next time, she'd do best to stick closer to home.</p></div>"
85,spring,2005,s2005,moschino,"Put Carmen Miranda through the Milanese fashion blender, and you might end up with a sweet-tasting fashion cocktail that looks something like Moschino for Spring 2005. Take a few puffed sleeves, exaggerated forties prints, and eyelet frilled petticoats, throw them in with vertiginous stripy platforms and lamp-shade hats, and voilà: The mood is set.</p><p>The down-Mexico-way theme is, of course, merely this season's excuse for adding decorative froth to an essentially easy to wear, girly collection. (The show also took in the current feeling for handcraft, in the raw-edged appliqué on a flowery chiffon full-skirted coat, and the naïve animal embroideries applied to a flouncy, floor-length peasant skirt.)</p><p>But when these runway ideas translate into retail reality, as pieces on a rack, they won't look like literal retro. Apply the Moschino spring spirit to blouses, or the edgings on a black trench, and the results look like sane propositions for a normal wardrobe. Still, even on the runway, all that forties stuff can strain credibility. Who's up for a pair of shorts with an outburst of lacy ruffles at the knee? We'd like to know.</p></div>"
86,spring,2005,s2005,narciso-rodriguez,"Only in Narciso Rodriguez's precision-cut world could a few inches mean so much. But he's known as the man whose monochrome dresses leave barely enough room to breathe, so when Rodriguez opens his spring show with a loose, floaty pink frock, well, it's news.</p><p>There was lots of news in this collection, all good. Maybe it's those trips to Brazil (his favorite vacation spot), but Rodriguez is definitely easing up. He still cuts like an architect—mapping the body's curves with careful arcs and parabolas—but now, the end result is warmer, sexier, easier. He used lightweight fabrics like papery silk, sheer cotton voile, linen, and nylon to construct lean trousers, trim jackets, neat skirts, and body-skimming tanks. And vivid color took it even further: turquoise, coral, pink, and light green danced amid crisp white and inky black.</p><p>One of the week's most widespread trends has been the waistline's move upward, to mid-torso or even Empire level; Rodriguez has been doing that for a few seasons, but he hammered it home this time with mini-corsets and bra tops, sometimes layered atop each other, and A-line cuts that flared out above the ribs. His trimly tailored shorts, ending just above the knee, were a convincing argument for an otherwise questionable look. Rodriguez closed with a series of lovely, liquid silk dresses whose curving skirts rippled out behind the models like sails swaying in a gentle breeze. Dreamy.</p></div>"
87,spring,2005,s2005,nina-ricci,"For Lars Nilsson at Nina Ricci, third time really was a charm. Nilsson's first collection for this French house, best known for its scents, concentrated on lace, lingerie, and ladylike suits. His second was an eclectic mix—tweed jackets, sequin capelets, tees under chiffon blouses—in which some of the best elements got lost. For spring 2005, the designer successfully merged these two worlds—and all in a beautiful color palette of orchid, pebble, and blush (Ricci-speak for pale mauve, light khaki, and rose pink).</p><p>Nilsson's vision of spring, then, included both a slim top-stitched taffeta skirtsuit and a more casual combination of purple cardigan, scarf-print silk blouse, and above-the-knee skirt, its hem injected with a touch of volume. The standouts were the jackets (cut close to the body, with narrow shoulders, high armholes, and cropped sleeves) and dresses—in particular, one that was draped, bloused, and belted, the other a sweet confection of cotton, beading, and eyelet embroidery.</p><p>This was a somewhat repetitive show that would have benefited from a stricter edit. But the handwork on display—the embroideries, the lace trims, the ribboned lace—was typical of the love and respect that young designers at established French houses are now showing for couturelike details and finishes. Long may it last.</p></div>"
88,spring,2005,s2005,oscar-de-la-renta,"Whether or not you live the life that demands an Oscar de la Renta wardrobe, his collections are a delight to the eyes: flawlessly executed, poised and urbane, with just the right balance of mature charm and youthful exuberance. Skeptics who doubt his generation-spanning skills need only glance over the front row of his spring collection, where Mandy Moore, Serena Williams, Ashley Olsen, and Jessica Simpson oohed and aahed as much as the society ladies who grew up on Oscar.</p><p>If anybody is going to go bold in a season of demure, sometimes lukewarm fashion, let it be de la Renta. Tropical climates are second nature to him, and that shows in his deep, rich hues: chocolate, red, orange, and pink, played off white, navy, and beige. New textures, like crochet, and whimsical touches—like pompoms trimming a white bouclé dress—gave his clean, classic silhouettes a casual youthfulness. His slim shirtdresses and light-as-foam nubby suits solved any daytime dilemmas. And when it comes to eveningwear, no one knows more about giving women what they want. A coolly elegant strapless dress with an undulating pouf skirt? A high-drama pink tulle and feather concoction? Or a simply stunning white-and-gold Empire-waist column, worn with flat gold sandals? In Oscar's world, there's no such thing as the wrong choice.</p></div>"
89,spring,2005,s2005,paul-smith,"Paul Smith is very much on his own turf this season. A cheerful English gent, he's always secretly been enamored of well-brought-up girls, flower gardens, and a bit of cheeky fun. At the beginning of his show, Lily Cole—the 16-year-old redheaded London schoolgirl—strode out in a little blue-and-white Liberty print cotton trench, the very embodiment of those very British ideas. Cole was followed by a lineup of little pastel tweed jackets with contrast linings, seed-packet floral prints, and cardigans. One dress looked as if it had a fifties apron incorporated into it—perhaps for making tea to take out onto the extensive lawn Mr. Smith had laid out for the occasion.</p><p>Couldn't be perkier or more of the moment, of course. At a time when the entire fashion world is playing with ideas of eccentricity and ladylike virtues, Smith is well within his fashion comfort zone, though he hasn't lost his soft spot for tomboys. His trim little pantsuits with African-print pork-pie hats looked just spiffy. Come the evening, though, this collection was never quite sure where to go. Thigh-slit variations on cheongsams didn't really do it, but never mind. Smith's designs are more about innocent laughter on a sunny afternoon, and that's how it should be.</p></div>"
90,spring,2005,s2005,perry-ellis,"The artful mix is a hallmark of modern fashion, but it can be a perilous approach. One too many vintage references and the whole effort crumbles into thrift store pastiche. There is no danger of that happening at Perry Ellis, where Patrick Robinson showed yet another strong collection that showcased his skill at making oddball combinations work as persuasively sophisticated sportswear.</p><p>Once again, Robinson wisely opted for a small walk-through presentation, with just 18 looks on a band of fair-haired models, all bee-stung lips and Pre-Raphaelite tresses. He merged retro and modern, regal with humble, and played strict masculine tailoring (a skill he refined while working for Giorgio Armani) against giggly, sweet femininity. Robinson put a matelassé mustard bolero atop jean-tailored khakis, or a filmy black ruched blouse against a dense jacquard pencil skirt, or a royal-blue top with lime-green beading over a taupe skirt covered in ribbon. Workaday seersucker and polished cotton countered richer materials like jacquard, velvet, and chiffon, while shapes were simple and wearable: plenty of variations on the pencil skirt, neat full-leg trousers in crisp fabrics, and tops cut close but not skintight, accented with a touch of seventies-era peasant chic in the pintucking and embroidered touches. Plenty of designers can throw together some pieces and call it fashion; the difference (and the delight) at Perry Ellis is watching Robinson turn that into a realistic, wearable proposition.</p></div>"
91,spring,2005,s2005,peter-jensen,"Peter Jensen is a Danish designer who has quietly settled himself in grimy London, without losing the purity of his Scandinavian roots. Was it his Nordic upbringing that drew him to an ice rink as the perfect venue for a summer show? Whatever that strange doublethink, his show, performed by champion skaters from all over Britain, turned out to be the sweetest offering—all innocent cotton dresses, clear colors, doodle prints, and strategically placed outsize pompoms.</p><p>Jensen's apparently teenage models cut up the ice in pristine white shirts, knee-shorts, ticking-striped shrunken blazers, and puffed-sleeve, full-skirted dresses with a frosting of tulle petticoat twirling beneath. There were sundresses and pseudo-grown-up suits in bright fruit-and-veg prints, and a lovely twirl from a lemon chiffon baby doll. The bracing, non-fashiony youth of the performance brought the biggest smiles and loudest applause of the week.</p></div>"
92,spring,2005,s2005,peter-som,"No matter what the cultural stereotypes are about bookworms and their stunted sense of style, the fashion world knows that smart and pretty can—and often do—coexist. Take Peter Som's spring line. In a light and lovely collection, he demonstrated a practiced touch at merging those two ideas, which is part of what makes him a favorite with the young social set.</p><p>Som, a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Initiative finalist, used the idea of a warm-weather weekend getaway as his starting point, showing breezy dresses in floral prints or deep colors. But unlike some designers who seem to forget their clients have jobs, Som showed plenty of great work pieces: linen tweed jackets, slim skirts, and crisply tailored full-leg trousers, even some clean suits and loose, swingy coats. He puts fabrics in unusual contexts: a filigree lace top with khaki board shorts, for example, or a velvet tank with a silk burlap suit. And he uses retro references without looking like he's joined the raid on grandma's closet; a gold floral balmacaan coat had the aristocratic grace of something from the middle of the last century, but its generous cut and deep pockets kept it utterly contemporary.</p></div>"
93,spring,2005,s2005,phi,"Guido Palau doing hair, Diane Kendal on makeup. A high-octane PR firm handling the logistics, the season's best models on the runway, and Diane Sawyer in the front row. A 10,000-square-foot loft headquarters with cinematic views of the Hudson River, and a brand-new store in SoHo. This doesn't sound like your typical second season from a fledgling designer. Then again, Phi is no shoestring startup; it's backed by Susan Dell, the fashion-loving wife of computer billionaire Michael, and she's got the deep pockets and determination necessary to establish a new player in the merciless fashion world.</p><p>Phi's even had its first designer turnover—original creative director Tim Garland left in July after one season, handing the reins to design director Andreas Melbostad. But there was no sign of bumpiness on spring's runway: Melbostad segued seamlessly from fall's urban-goth look to a more delicate collection that still reflected Phi's luxurious take on tough chic. He kept the palette limited to black, ivory, and pinky nude, and used fabrics ranging from tissue-weight silk and cotton to stiff linen canvas and supple kangaroo skin. There were well-cut trousers, silky bare camisoles, and fluid knits, and some standout boxy bombers, pea coats, and trenches. And the fluttery georgette and chiffon dresses and gowns, with just enough detailing, did due penance for some clunky sarong shorts and bubble skirts.</p></div>"
94,spring,2005,s2005,pollini,"In his second season for Pollini—the company that made its name with riding boots in the seventies—Rifat Ozbek was thinking about modern maharanis. Updating the Tibetan theme of his first show, he described this collection as ""more about cocktail pieces"" and took a dressy, decorative approach, showing luxe leather blousons, sequin-embellished jackets, and skimpy printed dresses and skirts.</p><p>Ozbek struck a refreshing note with his opening silhouette, a sleeveless orange leather cutaway blouson with a slim georgette floor-length skirt; variations on the look ended with a full-on evening top in silver and gold over a long skirt in dusty-blue shot silk. In between, ethnic references were Westernized in forties-style flower-garland and raindrop prints, which were made into bias dresses and trailing scarves, and short sheaths done in computerized ikat patterns.</p><p>Whom, though, is this collection really aimed at? Ozbek's softer styles might appeal to a younger woman, but there's something about his stiffer jackets, with their square shoulders and the way they hit the hip, that says ""older.""</p></div>"
95,spring,2005,s2005,prada,"Just when the whole fashion world has turned ladylike—thanks, of course, to Miuccia Prada—she's tossed it all in the air, looking for a certain freedom. ""A vague idea of birds; birds of vanity, like peacocks, parrots, and swans,"" was a starting point in her restless search for change, she explained. ""I also wanted to move toward something more young and sporty, tall and narrow.""</p><p>To bring the audience into her new reality, Prada stripped her familiar clean, boxed-in stage set down to the bare industrial walls, then projected Rem Koolhaas' mind-scrambling collage of live news images onto them. It was a lot to take in before the show even started—but that, one suspects, was exactly Prada's intention with the clothes, as well. There was so much going on, it was almost impossible to process at first sitting.</p><p>In broad terms, the news from Prada included a different silhouette (short hemlines, worn mostly with flat sandals), a return to one of her favorite palettes (brown-ochre-rust), and as always, lots of artful eccentricity (peacock feathers, flowerpot hats, Bakelite digital watches). There was also a Jamaican dance hall vibe, with reggae on the sound system, Rasta stripes in the knitwear, and Caribbean crochet in the raffia hats and cardigan coats. The birds really took flight for night, in the form of skirts overlaid with peacock feathers, dresses covered with digitalized feather prints, and pretty chiffon gowns whose fanlike pleats hinted subtly at dove's wings.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""on988cq""></div></div><p>It seems surreal to say this was one of the plainer, simpler Prada collections we've seen for a long time. But for all the intellectual flights that went into this collection, that is perhaps Prada's most important point.</p></div>"
96,spring,2005,s2005,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton deserve credit for cleaning up their act. No more showing in death-trap underground venues; now, it's more like hyper-modern financial-center locations with stunning panoramic views of the City of London. Sensitive to the changing fashion climate, this couple have been steering Preen clear of gritty street deconstructionism, toward something softer and more evolved. Example: They're still doing their thing with upside-down scrappy bits of recycled sweatshirting, but those pieces now resolve themselves into gentle wrap dresses, skirts with floppy volumes, and cascading details of chopped-up ribbing in the back of jackets that might almost be called frills. The fabrics have been upgraded as well, to include silk jersey, linen, and cashmere.</p><p>At the heart of this collection was their take on Africa (a trend that's been rising all summer from Portobello Road market, where Preen is based), with a glance toward Holly Hobbie. That meant a splashy micro-print got worked into some bunchy cotton dresses, and others turned out as abstract, collaged, folksy trapezes. It led them very near territory that has already been explored by the advance guard of Nicolas Ghesquière, Sophia Kokosalaki, and Hussein Chalayan, but there was enough to give the collection an integrity of its own.</p></div>"
97,spring,2005,s2005,proenza-schouler,"For their fourth collection, Lazaro Hernandez and partner Jack McCollough aimed for ""something soft and chic."" The show, which featured one model per look, elegantly built upon the duo's strengths, in order to achieve that softness: intricate seaming, strong coats, silk bustiers, virtuoso embellishment. They carried over last season's focus on feathers and metallics, but with a new theme that mixed surf, Arab, and African influences. One characteristically cool outfit paired an embroidered gold tank with khaki cotton shorts, while a mahogany and cream jacquard silk velvet skirt was all sophistication. Intricately embroidered wood-pattern pieces and textural, graphic prints demonstrated Hernandez and McCollough's devotion to—and skill with—the subtle art of surface treatment.</p><p>There was strong sportswear aplenty, from a bleached alligator coat to a printed lamé jacket, and sharp trousers were shown alongside shorts and pencil skirts—all in a twisted palette that successfully combined mint, lilac, brown, khaki, and white. It was perfectly framed by some mean metallic shoes and supported by a soundtrack that mixed the Beach Boys, Magnetic Fields, and Davie Allan. The finale—Hana Soukupova, Gemma Ward, and Daria Werbowy parading by in floaty, patterned dresses worn over those signature bodysuits—summed up both the skill and the feeling Proenza Schouler has managed to distill in just four seasons.</p></div>"
98,spring,2005,s2005,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren's spring show was inspired by the polished, formal wardrobes of thirties society in Hollywood and Manhattan. Aiming to update that golden moment, Lauren produced an impeccable array of sportswear that was also a healthy reminder—in a season so focused on single items—of what a complete collection should be about.</p><p>From slouchy silk cardigans over fragile lingerie dresses, to narrow, nip-waisted jackets over slim, calf-grazing skirts, to tan shantung suits with cropped trousers, Lauren sent out entire outfits that could sail straight into the closet of a latter-day Daisy Buchanan. Sound too retro? No, thanks to a handful of deft, modern touches like gleaming, silvery fabrics; metallic belts; high-heel spectator pumps; and even a Polo pony logo, redone in crystal on a pair of full-cut white denim jeans.</p><p>For evening, Lauren rose to the occasion with a series of figure-caressing, bias-cut hammered-satin gowns. The forebears of these pieces were worn in rooms filled with witty banter and popping Champagne corks; their seductive descendents are destined for red carpets and popping flashbulbs.</p></div>"
99,spring,2005,s2005,ralph-rucci,"Ralph Rucci approaches his ready-to-wear line with all the gravitas of an architect commissioned to design a national monument. Rich fabrics and exotic skins subordinate themselves to his authority. Every seam, every edge, every hem follows its assignment. Details are dazzlingly precise. It's the kind of brainy approach to fashion that benefits from close scrutiny by a connoisseur—say, for example, the wealthy women who've become such Chado fans over the years—not the impatient audience at a New York runway show.</p><p>Rucci's spring collection opened with relative zip; seven models strode out at once, each in a slightly different, but equally beautiful, colorful silk raincoat with matching pagoda hat. Eminently practical, and certainly a viable option to the ubiquitous trench. The designer then segued into daywear, showing narrow skirts, tailored trousers, neat dresses, and beautiful coats. He used wool crepe, silk, leather, and outrageously luxe materials, like sheared mink or alligator sliced into thin strips, stitched to tulle and then adroitly wrapped around the body. Rucci's designs pay a debt to Japan—not its pop culture, God forbid, but its formal dress, in the form of kimono sleeves, geometric volumes, and collars that sit back on the spine (a great technique for elongating the neck). His eveningwear is equally grand; the final look was a technical tour de force of white duchesse satin marked out in an expanding grid. Impressive as always; but all that intensity could use a little levity to balance it out.</p></div>"
100,spring,2005,s2005,richard-chai-love,"After years in the service of others—he worked at Marc Jacobs and then as one of the designers at Tse—Chai finally broke out on his own this season, joining a calendar crowded with relative newcomers. But while many of his contemporaries sent out spring collections that seemed intended for artsy socialites, Chai worked a cool new angle with minimalist leanings.</p><p>He played crisp fabrics off soft—papery sateen, organza, and twill against gossamer voile and georgette—in a muted palette of gray, white, and light tan with bits of pale yellow and mint green. Chai kept shapes tailored close to the body, but never tight, and assembled the kind of outfits that might be worn by a low-key but hip gallery owner: boxy jackets with Claude Montana-worthy shoulders over silk boxers, a white bra top with a fluttery skirt, a bustier over a sheer knit top with a knee-length tulip skirt. Chai fumbled with some awkward kimono tops, but his narrow-cut trousers had an air of authority. In a season that sometimes verged on shrill femininity, Chai's quiet voice proved a refreshing alternative.</p></div>"
101,spring,2005,s2005,rick-owens,"Rick Owens, of all people, inspired by nuns? That, he said, was the thinking behind his spring collection, one that was clearly meant to prove he's capable of designing beyond his familiar (albeit very successful) traily, greigey layers of T-shirting and leather. The first jacket, with its winged effect springing from a puffy shoulder line, was presumably drawn from a mother superior's wimple. That was followed by shortie bloomers in heavy duchesse satin, carrying what looked like an extra skirt in front. Distantly related to a Cistercian robe? Maybe, but still utterly impossible to wear.</p><p>Given the change-hungry, unsparingly critical Parisian arena, Owens is right to move his aesthetic along. But there's always risk in change, and his first experiments with heavier, more-luxe fabrics were puzzling. Things were much better when he kept them light. His new palette, which included shades of pink, white, burnt orange, and cinnamon worked quite beautifully—especially the slim, bias-cut, vaguely thirties georgette dresses, nipped and tucked here and there for a hip sort of asymmetry. The sheer white tulle-stuffed bomber, and the delicate fan-pleating he pieced into some of his jackets and skirts, also brought in a new, even romantic, feeling. His ragged-edged shorts, cut like slouchy men's trousers, felt right for the season. But when they were worn by skinny youths who staggered perversely around in six-inch platform boots with a lot of white chest and hairy leg on show? Lord, help us!</p></div>"
102,spring,2005,s2005,roberto-cavalli,"Sometimes, the sheer gutsiness of a personal conviction can make a collection inspiring. From the second Gemma Ward stormed onto the runway—in a long, flounced peasant skirt, tiny ethnic vest, and a bush hat bound in a print scarf—Roberto Cavalli's spring presentation was a thrill almost equal to the good old days of show time Milan.</p><p>Cavalli's theme, according to his program notes, was Fashion Traveler. Translation: an eclectic throwing-together of hippie-ish trailing print skirts, ruffled cavalier shirts (worn belted at the hip as tantalizing dresses), and nineteenth century Sgt. Pepper-ish frogged military jackets.</p><p>Inevitably—for this is Milan—Cavalli also embraced the mania for Africa that is doing the rounds (is it contagious?). Yet his shifts, beaded with African mask motifs, looked like more than a token gesture. And his ability to go beyond paying lip service to a trend led to some enviable moments of in-your-face decoration—like boleros or evening dresses encrusted with great spiky outcrops of coral. In these times of ladylike fashion, Cavalli is providing a missionary outreach program for rock chicks. And for that alone, he deserves a benediction.</p></div>"
103,spring,2005,s2005,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens has been a chief instigator of fashion's heady two-year affair with recherché femininity. Romancing the conventions of Parisian couture, he has done things with lace, tulle, flowers, and flounces that effectively put ""edginess"" out of style.</p><p>One of the designer's works in progress is the revival of the formal skirtsuit. For spring, it came in plissé silk, detailed with swags at the top of the sleeve, or in variations on boleros and pencil skirts, with organza edging adding extra volume. Another favored theme was structured lingerie, referenced in trompe l'oeil pieces that looked as if the backs of dresses were open to show bra straps or as if the fronts of skirts were falling down to reveal the structure of an old-fashioned girdle.</p><p>Theyskens' distinctive, slightly strange color palette helped keep things from getting too sugary: odd aquas, metallic greens, and sapphire blues were mixed, sometimes in floral patterns, with black and white. That, along with the floppy silk roses pinned on the bosom of dresses, his appliqués of eyelash lace over flower prints, and the grand bustier gowns with their naked shoulders and sweeping petticoated trains, has crystallized a Rochas look that is unmistakable. In a few short seasons, that is quite an achievement; but given fashion's continual headlong rush forward, such slow, methodical moves can seem almost imperceptible on a runway.</p></div>"
104,spring,2005,s2005,roland-mouret,"This was the third season that French-born Roland Mouret decided to show in New York instead of his adopted London, where his designs are a mainstay of young-Brit chic. And once again, he proved that his neatly tailored suits and dresses are worthy of a larger audience.</p><p>In a season filled with throw-it-together thrift store dressing, Mouret's crisp spring collection looked all the fresher. That's not to say it was devoid of retro references. The theme was ""Belles de Jour,"" and swingy jackets with three-quarter sleeves and wide necklines atop pencil skirts certainly summoned the proper cool of Catherine Deneuve. But the designer kept everything contemporary—and let out that suppressed sensuality—with sexy, body-conscious cuts, languid silk shirts, and sheer knits, and a color palette based around chilly grays, yellow, mint green, and turquoise. Even tricky metallic fabrics emerged elegant but subdued, swathed in organza and made up into gleaming little cocktail dresses. When it comes to crossing the Atlantic in style, Mouret gives the new Queen Mary II a run for her money.</p></div>"
105,spring,2005,s2005,saint-laurent,"How to follow the mighty histories of Yves Saint Laurent and Tom Ford at YSL Rive Gauche? Faced with that weighty task, Stefano Pilati, in his first solo runway outing, handled things his own way. He made a clean break from the past by showing in a different, much lighter venue (the Paris Bourse) than Ford and by starting his show with a short, black-and-white polka-dot raincoat with tulip-curved hemline, cinched by a wide, square-buckled black patent leather belt. Ford would never have done that—nor the peplum-jacketed dotted suits with their short skirts, swooping up to a bustle of folds in the back. It's a compliment to Pilati that the mental comparison game had worn out at about Look 6. The guy obviously has a few things of his own to say.</p><p>""It's something between the fifties and the eighties—which is my time—but to do it now, with volumes in a different way,"" said Pilati, the 38-year-old who assisted Ford at YSL for four years and formerly designed at Prada. He managed to combine an imaginative respect for the house's history, while creating something new (for a generation not necessarily interested in labored references) without slavish replication.</p><p>The newness showed in the proportions. Those short tulip skirts, gathered into the waist and shown with a rounded shoulder line, moved confidently away from YSL's louche, hip-riding nineties silhouette. For the costume-history spotter, there was a nod to Saint Laurent himself in the broad belts on every daywear look—but that didn't stop them from looking like a great accessory for right now. Ditto the shoes, especially the high suede loafers with big, chic tassels, doused in pure YSL shades of strong red or vibrant green—and potentially a major hit.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""3rgww2""></div></div><p>Pilati's emphasis on daywear also changed the collection's priorities. For night, he dipped into ruffles and flounces, in intense fuchsia, purple, and egg-yolk yellow taffeta, or light waterfall frills of black-and-white chiffon—all with a flavor of flamenco about them. He finished with a few georgette apron dresses that were just the right side of undone. An intriguing first statement for an experienced talent getting a well-deserved chance to speak for himself.</p></div>"
106,spring,2005,s2005,sari-gueron,"Sari Gueron's day-before-show-week presentation, a tableau at the St. Regis hotel, proved prescient in its prettiness. The Israel-born, Connecticut-bred designer showed a well-edited collection of 13 lovely dresses that, as it turned out, fit right in with the week's trend of feminine clothes with a bygone elegance.</p><p>Against the hotel's ultra-formal, burgundy-and-wood paneling, Gueron's soft, slightly off colors—curry, lentil green, teal and gold lace—popped beautifully. The various silhouettes, including wrap styles and scarf fronts, recalled the twenties and thirties, and Gueron's love for the innovative French designer Madeleine Vionnet. The interesting color mix, and the modern sense of ease, made these dresses just right for putting on the Ritz.</p></div>"
107,spring,2005,s2005,sebastian-pons,"Like most transplants, Sebastian Pons turns to his homeland for inspiration. Fortunately for the Majorca-born designer, he's got a rich heritage, much of which made its way into his spring collection. Pons called the show El Dorado, a reference both to the mythical paradise and to the New World, ""where people came to find their dreams, fall in love, mix their cultures,"" he said afterward.</p><p>His personal paradise was a veritable United Nations of references, including everything from white linen peasant dresses, tiered and trimmed with eyelet and ribbon; little flamenco minis, cut tight and ruffled along the erogenous zones; cowboy-tinged shirts and pants; and jackets and trousers made from bulky fabrics printed to resemble checkered tablecloths or mattress stripes. It was a cheerful romp through Pons' vivid imagination, but a few more simple looks—such as the lovely hand-painted white silk dress or the belted coat in a blue Chinese motif—would have given the idealistic collection a needed dose of reality.</p></div>"
108,spring,2005,s2005,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel's invitation came printed with a single word: legend. In an industry not shy about self-aggrandizement, for once this description was accurate. Rykiel holds the same place in the hearts of the French as the Marianne, Edith Piaf, and <em>les frites</em>. Rykiel's most recent collections have continued to perpetuate her truly French persona. She can—and does—send out skinny sweaters, feather boas, and floppy fedora hats tilted at a rakish angle, time and time again. Yet it's so intrinsically her that it works.</p><p>Will it survive a transatlantic crossing, though? Caution is advised when it comes to the acid-green linen dress trailing strands of marabou, or the jingle-jangling tops strewn with gold coins. But there are pieces worthy of consideration: a pink floral organza tea dress with fluttery hems and a champagne satin thirties-look evening dress delicious as a <em>coup</em> of Dom Pérignon. Rykiel is no slouch when it comes to accessories: The sun hats, crystal-studded belts, and multitude of black bangles inlaid with mother-of-pearl all looked good. (Note to early adopters: A stack of bangles is all set to replace the brooch next season.)</p><p>Rykiel also provided her audience with one of her signature, sentimental finales. As a lounge singer crooned ""Imagine,"" models in brightly colored cotton evening dresses sat on the stage, swaying in time. Then a curtain went up on a crowd of striped sweater-dress-clad models who strolled down the runway, whooping and cheering. It could have all been as ripe as Camembert had not Rykiel appeared with her beaming grandchild Salomé; that alone turned it from trite to a touching family affair.</p></div>"
109,spring,2005,s2005,sophia-kokosalaki,"After devoting an entire year to designing the costumes for 7,000 of her Greek compatriots for the Athens Olympics opening ceremonies, it's astonishing that Sophia Kokosalaki had the stamina to even think of a theme for her own collection—let alone produce it. But this resourceful young woman not only came up with a theme—the sea and all its contents—she made it her Paris debut.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the collection contained some reminders of Kokosalaki's Olympics work, opening with a bunchily rippled blue-painted wave dress reminiscent of the stadium-scaled gown she made for Björk. There were bodices textured like the insides of shells, shoulders sprouting anemone-like fronds, and silk-jersey seaweed pieces in watery blue and palest pink.</p><p>Still, a theme only counts for so much. What really registers is recognizable continuity in a designer's vision, and Kokosalaki wisely concentrated on her strength in dresses. She emphasized her signature draping, in corded pleats that ran over the bodices of jersey dresses; the best, in pink with a scooped back. The glittering ripples of sun on wet sand appeared as gold beading on skirts or on glinting belts and cummerbunds.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""onbrm""></div></div><p>It was an ambitious effort for Kokosalaki's first show outside her adopted London. The squeezed schedule and multiple demands no doubt took their toll on the technical execution, which didn't achieve the complexity her designs demand. To fully realize her talent, Kokosalaki needs time and investment; perhaps the exposure of Paris will capture the attention she deserves.</p></div>"
110,spring,2005,s2005,stella-mccartney,"Every now and again, a fashion mood emerges that should work particularly well for certain designers. Sometimes, they hit their stride and get it right during that period; sometimes, they don't. Stella McCartney's spring collection put her firmly into the former. She took what has been slowly emerging in Milan and Paris—pastoral, romantic dressing, and a sharper, speedier sportswear aesthetic—and spliced them together. It's not that she hasn't tried to do this before, but this season it just all came together. Better still, she hit on some of the other key trends—safari jackets; slouchy, straight-cut cuffed pants; and breezy, billowing dresses—and effortlessly made them her own.</p><p>McCartney is most convincing when it looks like the clothes belong in her world, not to mention her closet. Previous seasons have featured pieces that were a little too tricky for their own good: If you can't imagine her wearing it, then it's not going to fly. But this time round, McCartney played to her strengths: A smidge of vintage (floaty floral chiffon dresses), a touch of lingerie (camisoles and bras used to good effect layered underneath tops or dresses), pretty tailoring (shrunken jackets over those loose pants). And she made the strongest case for tiered gypsy skirts, letting them swoosh along the runway in white cotton muslin, as delicate as Edwardian underwear.</p></div>"
111,spring,2005,s2005,temperley-london,"It's not difficult to figure out how Alice Temperley has made a success of herself, within girly, high-flying NY-Lon social circles, in a few short seasons. She's a pretty young dressmaker, and her dresses are pretty, too. Beaded frocks for afternoon, and after, are what she does best: slight little things with spangles and scalloped edges, and sparkly cardigan cover-ups to pop on top. Add in crochet, forties-flavor dresses and some Ossie Clark-styled soft crepe jackets, and that's about it for summer.</p><p>Temperley has a knack for carrying off the nice-girl, flighty-flirty thing without ever going skimpily slutty. That's a fine line to tread—and not the only subtle maneuver a designer needs to master when grappling with the subject of appropriate prettiness for summer evenings. Another is color. As this collection at times inadvertently showed, aqua, lilac, coral, and pale yellow can be treacherous. If a girl's not careful, they can turn that dreaded term: ""Missy.""</p></div>"
112,spring,2005,s2005,thakoon,"In just ten pieces, designer Thakoon Panichgul put himself on the map with an aesthetic that's forward-looking, respectful of the past, and not at all vintage. In fact, Panichgul's delicate deconstructions—as seen on a silver taffeta inside-out skirt and cotton-linen shorts—are entirely modern, owing more to the Antwerp Six than to Vionnet. And though his collection might be perfect for a modern Madame de Pompadour, it would suit an L.A. starlet just as well. Who could resist a mint taffeta shirt-jacket with ribbon trim, or a silver taffeta embroidered coat?</p><p>Cecil Beaton portraits of debutantes in Charles James gowns were Panichgul's starting point, and he managed to execute his own sense of elegant gravitas with a lightness and focus that belied his youth. ""I think that fashion is entering into a new kind of formality—one that is spirited and space age, rather than stuffy and boring,"" Panichgul said afterward. We're definitely up for the ride.</p></div>"
113,spring,2005,s2005,tommy-hilfiger,"It's raucous, it's rowdy, it's rock 'n' roll—it must be Tommy Hilfiger. If the designer's ability to bridge multiple worlds was ever in doubt, the front row at his spring show put that to rest. Jade Jagger on one end, Denise Richards on the other, and in between them, Mischa Barton, Janet Jackson, the Black Eyed Peas, and P. Diddy (with entourage). Now there's a cross section of modern pop culture.</p><p>Hilfiger managed to please them all with a breezy, confident collection. Inspired by a summertime sailing trip, Hilfiger focused on all things seaside. He started with a cozy, ankle-length dress done in classic sailor stripes, worn by the undulating Naomi Campbell. There were tweaked classics, like a white cotton pea coat, a rainbow-hued schoolboy's jacket, and ivory sateen sailor pants. But Hilfiger throws a rocker edge in when he can, and that showed up in a bright-orange mini leather jacket worn over a tiny bikini, and a saucy pair of gold Lurex shorts with a sheer white shirt. And even the most determined landlubber would be charmed by the cool ivory gown that closed the show.</p></div>"
114,spring,2005,s2005,tuleh,"Bryan Bradley is taking Tuleh to a darker place—or at least injecting irony into the line that's become a mainstay of the young, Upper East Side social circuit. Of course, Tuleh's appeal has consistently been its ability to make pretty clothes that aren't cliché. This season, Bradley's throwing some extra bite into that beloved mix—starting with the soundtrack (an antiplastic-surgery rap by Mother Inc., the rock group made up of Yvonne Force Villareal and Sandra Hamburg), continuing with the front-row celebrity (Keith Richards and Patti Hansen, there to cheer on their modeling daughters), and finishing up with the clothes.</p><p>Bradley's gifted color mixes are a trademark of Tuleh, and he didn't disappoint: apricot with olive, pink with brown, blue and brown with yellow, and so on. And there was plenty of traditional Tuleh to be found, in Empire-waist chiffon blouses, fluttery dresses, and those famous boxy jackets with the extended cuff and oversize buttons. But he also executed some daredevil moves, like a rubbery gray raincoat over a lace dress, or some unnervingly nubbly gilded frog-skin pieces. How well edgy and socialite will mix remains to be seen, but Bradley's fan base is big and loyal. Which means spring could be darker than usual.</p></div>"
115,spring,2005,s2005,undercover,"Understanding what’s going on at an Undercover show is a little like attempting to finish an incomplete jigsaw: The picture nearly makes sense, except for one or two crucial, missing pieces. This isn’t a criticism; in a world that often serves up fashion meant to be speed-read and tossed aside, Jun Takahashi’s clothes are worth the time it takes to interpret them. His spring collection, pitted against the raw, distressed terra-cotta walls of the Theatre des Bouffes du Nord, was no exception.</p><p>The show, according to the invitation, was an “homage to Jan Svankmajer.” For those not completely <em>au fait</em> with the underground Eastern European movie world, Svankmajer is a surrealist Czech film director who has been dubbed “Prague’s alchemist of film.” Takahashi wasn’t interested in transforming base metal—or base celluloid, for that matter—but rather in conjuring fashion out of the domestic environment. This being Undercover, Takahashi worked his magic with a very specific home décor, a type that suggested down-at-the-heels Paris in the thirties: white lace tablecloths became a beaded shirt and a full skirt; a faded ruby panné velvet curtain turned into a dress; and a gold sequined tank topped a witty gray lampshade skirt that came complete with a satin bow and a fringed hem.</p><p>Takahashi continued his theme with references to wallpaper, using charming faded florals for paint-smeared Tyvek dresses or peeling the fabric of a beige trenchcoat to reveal a layer beneath. Sometimes it took a decidedly creepy turn: A dress that looked like its wearer’s innards are spilling out is not destined for widespread adoration. This aside, Undercover continues to puzzle and pleasure in equal measure.</p></div>"
116,spring,2005,s2005,united-bamboo,"United Bamboo showed an accomplished, if somewhat uneven, spring collection that touched on the themes of the week (peasant and safari looks, for example) while maintaining its signature style. The action was mostly in the details: silk knit tank dresses with woven panels at the bust; lively touches of gold on floral blouses and skirts, and hand-sewn strips on the cotton tunics for a touch of crafty individuality. Fluid jerseys, crisp cottons, and a mix of prints added to the interest.</p><p>Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham, the line's designers, cut a mean jacket, which they showed in safari and tuxedo versions, worn with wrap-over pants and culottes for an interesting play on proportion. But those lighter peasant-style pieces hit the most felicitous note for spring.</p></div>"
117,spring,2005,s2005,valentino,"After fall's hardcore Helmut Newton Valkyrie, with her wardrobe of tough suits and men's ties, Valentino did a complete reverse. His spring 2005 collection drew inspiration from a woman who travels the world, hitting the global trail with a few hippie looks and some personal charms. Of course, since she's a Valentino gal, her caravan is more likely to be a yacht, and the band she travels with will include her chef, hairdresser, and personal trainer. Nor is she packing light; courtesy of Valentino, she'll be well supplied with ruffled floral chiffon dresses, pleated cotton skirts embroidered with bands of gold, and small, fitted jackets strewn with beads, in a palette centering around lime, ivory, and earthy shades of ochre and brick.</p><p>And as for those personal charms, she's wearing them everywhere: huge chunky pendants at the neck, a gold cuff on each wrist (some spelling out ""VAL,"" others encrusted with enormous flowers), and leather belts in the shade of tan one might turn after too much top-deck sunbathing. Even those weren't left untouched. Some had buckles mounted with crystals, others were sewn with strands of pearls. Valentino, like every other designer showing in Paris this season, put a major emphasis on accessories. The best was a tan leather thong decorated with ivory-and-gold flowers; it's the kind of sandal that will go the distance even if your summer is spent in the city, instead of round the Greek Islands.</p><p>This last point is crucial. Fashion is now in the process of redefining all its rules: what's glamorous, what's luxurious, what's casual, and what's appropriate, where and when and at what age. Valentino's response was to mix a welcome dose of reality into his bohemian deluxe looks. Sportier pieces, like silk charmeuse polo shirts and taffeta parkas, still had his glossy, luxurious style, but were far more suitable for everyday life.</p></div>"
118,spring,2005,s2005,vera-wang,"Vera Wang's evolution over the past several seasons into a full-fledged creator with an elegantly specific aesthetic has been a pleasure to watch. And this spring's collection, full of lovely, artsy dresses and skirts, finely detailed and delicately luxurious, clinches the transition.</p><p>Even though she's a red-carpet mainstay—witness Jennifer Connelly and Holly Hunter in her front row—Wang is not, and never will be, about flash and flesh. Her sex appeal comes from the sensuousness inherent in her materials—limpid crepe de chine, georgette, and charmeuse, muted gold lamé, brocade, fuzzy cashmere, and tissue-thin knits—and her slim, caressing cuts.</p><p>Wang had but one pair of pants in her collection; the rest was all narrow, fluid dresses and skirts cut every which way, from a slim, businesslike pencil to an organza delight, embroidered with gold peacock feathers and light as a dandelion. She paired these with crisp, blue or white cotton men's shirting fabrics, simple sweaters, and slightly retro prints to keep it all from getting too precious. Her color sense, too, kept the clothes resolutely modern: ivory, navy, brown, black, and taupe, with bits of color dropped in as if by a watercolor artist. A crimson tank top, a pistachio blouse, a dusty-rose gown, all floated down the runway against a subdued soundtrack that sounded like distant bells. Controlled scatterings of sequins and beads were a subtle reminder of her bridal brilliance—but luckily, Wang's strengths now reach way past the aisle, right into everyday life.</p></div>"
119,spring,2005,s2005,veronique-branquinho,"A stage set with two dozen young women seated in <em>Emmanuelle</em> peacock chairs and a soundtrack sampled from Barry White: Oh, baby, we're back in the seventies. But Veronique Branquinho's focus is hardly on soft-focus erotica; instead, she's thinking about the smart girl at the party, who exudes smoldering self-possession from the corner of the room.</p><p>This season, the Branquinho girl is projecting her reserved good taste from behind a curtain of long, pretty, blow-dried hair. She has a knack—maddening to her more showy competitors—for choosing understated pieces that are just right. She'll pick out a light tweed jacket and put it with a soft, romantic skirt and boots, or look fantastic just by wearing a slinky, striped knit and slender pants—and winding a long silk scarf round her neck. She's also one of the first to realize that a long skirt is a great way to go at this particular moment. Day or night, Branquinho has many ideas along those lines—from wrap jersey dresses to full-length halter gowns—guaranteed to turn heads without ever shrieking for attention.</p></div>"
120,spring,2005,s2005,versace,"Looking gloss-lipped and makeup-free, and with their blown-out hair whipping behind them, Donatella Versace's women made a brisk, clean, confidently polished entry into spring. Whatever the seasonal notion—the program notes insisted there was an ""underwater"" inspiration—the most vital point to bubble up from this presentation was its focus. This was Versace concentrating on what she and the house have always done best: sexy, draped jersey dressing, racily classic pantsuits, and red-carpet paparazzi stoppers.</p><p>Casting her mind back to her brother Gianni's heyday, Donatella revived the bold, multicolored silk scarf prints that he used chiefly to make into shirts. For spring, she reframed them with vivid coral patterns—not just for shirts, but also for playful leather-trimmed bags and deep-pile terry dressing gowns (excellent ammo for maximum poolside impact).</p><p>For the most part—save a couple of meanders—this was a high-powered performance that retrieved something of the force of the old Versace days. Dropping the eternal rock-chick stance in favor of a more reserved, upscale womanliness is—at least for the moment—looking like a good way to go.</p></div>"
121,spring,2005,s2005,viktor-rolf,"Viktor &amp; Rolf's many fashion fans love the often disconcerting drama of their presentations. While that magic may have been missing in the past couple of seasons, it was back in full force for spring. To the sound of a military drum tattoo, the Dutch duo sent out an entirely black collection on an army of female fighter pilots, each clad in anonymous black helmets. The short leather trenches, jackets, and blouses had aggressive, rounded shoulders reminiscent of Claude Montana's eighties power-dressing, but with the very Viktor &amp; Rolf addition of black satin ribbons, tied in bows.</p><p>They developed that sense of increasingly sinister chic through a lineup of taffeta bombers with their signature ruffle neck, homage-to-YSL tuxedo suits, and Chanel-like bow-trimmed cotton jackets. As the show drew to a close, with the sound of helicopters beating overhead, the ribbons became more and more vast, dementedly winding themselves around the last model like some surreal Brobdingnagian gift-wrap.</p><p>Then, just as it seemed that Viktor &amp; Rolf had gone over to the dark side, the stage revolved—and the world turned pink. ""Flowerbomb, Flowerbomb, Flowerbomb,"" breathed a woman's voice, as a second collection of gowns and suits, all in shades of rose and touches of light beige, paraded the runway. By that time, the penny had dropped. The incantation on the soundtrack is, of course, the name of the new Viktor &amp; Rolf fragrance. The bombardment of color, and the surreal sight of a woman with her head tied in a florist's bag, sent the audience into the slightly hysterical roar of appreciation that marks the climax of a good Viktor &amp; Rolf experience. To finish it off, the extraordinary pair appeared in matching tuxedos, striking a debonair pose in front of the new Flowerbomb ad. Their particular formula of odd-funny sensory and intellectual overload is just the sort of thing that makes Paris remarkable. ""We believe in the power of transforming anything into beauty,"" Viktor Horsting said afterward. ""And we all need an extra dose of that these days.""</p></div>"
122,spring,2005,s2005,vpl,"Still carrying a torch for Michael Phelps? VPL can help. For her first effort as the sole designer, Victoria Bartlett created a collection that included activewear, lingerie, and separates—all inspired by the Olympics. Her show/installation was staged at the Gym, a sparkling new high-tech workout facility, and she put the models through their paces—literally. They rode the bikes, skipped rope, and lifted weights in Bartlett's voile cardigans and tees, bandage racer tops, boy-cut panties, and Lycra leggings, sometimes augmented by Josh Hickey's ingenious ""beads of sweat"" necklace. But all the showmanship didn't overshadow the evolution of the line, thankfully. What started out as a small underwear project two years ago is turning into a real collection—without breaking a sweat.</p></div>"
123,spring,2005,s2005,wunderkind,"Forget all prior associations between Wolfgang Joop and heavy-handed mid- to late-nineties antics. The designer, who sold his eponymous label three years ago, returned to New York this season with a collection, Wunderkind Couture, that was an exercise in modern lightness. Described as ""luxury ready-to-wear,"" the line runs from casual looks (a sheer wrap dress worn over a white tank sheath) and into evening, where the rose-print dresses overlaid with black were unexpectedly dramatic. Blazers and pantsuits aplenty will please executive women, and the fashion-forward will eat up the coats and jackets in gold and silver. When he keeps it light, Joop showed he still has a Midas touch.</p></div>"
124,spring,2005,s2005,yohji-yamamoto,"Watching a Yohji Yamamoto show is something like listening to a lengthy jazz improvisation—by a Japanese musician who's also into Western classics. His spring show was constructed, and deconstructed, around two templates: crisp white cotton shirting, and Grecian pleating inspired by the great Parisian couturier Madame Grès. The opening look established both: a barefoot model in a long cotton shirt-gown decorated with a streak of pleating that fell from a rosette on one breast.</p><p>It was a meandering journey between that and the impressive, elegantly twisted black silk plissé eveningwear that closed the show. First came some austere zippered knee-length glazed-linen dresses with mesh-and-patent sneakers. Then followed many variations on his familiar black pantsuits, now done with sweeping portrait necklines and asymmetric baggy, drop-crotch trousers. (Admittedly extreme, but a nod nevertheless to trends that have been building in more mainstream collections.)</p><p>Passages in geranium red and dusty sage came and went as Yamamoto essayed various ideas about tunics and pants—sometimes fused into a single garment and lightened with lace inserts. But just as the tune seemed in danger of losing its audience, he circled back, developing the Madame Grès thought in a spectacular way. Densely packed pleats, sometimes braided, were wrapped and coiled into décolleté bodices, then set free to fan into elegant loops and trails. Filtered through an admiration of fifties' grand couture eveningwear, it was an innovative ending to an extended riff on modern femininity.</p></div>"
125,spring,2005,s2005,zac-posen,"Zac Posen is entering a crucial and tricky territory in any designer's career. He's no longer the new guy, but he hasn't quite gotten to the established phase yet. He's a nightlife fixture, but he's also a serious businessman with an investor partner (that would be Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, who bought part of Posen's business in April). And he's laid claim to a design aesthetic so specific he runs the risk of self-parody.</p><p>But so far, so good. The spring collection, called Trinity (and sponsored by Cartier), showed Posen capable of handling all that and then some. The look he chose to open the show spoke volumes: a simple white jacket over tailored trousers, instead of one of his famously pieced and fitted dresses, that seemed to declare, ""I can do sportswear, too."" He followed that with a group of clean white pieces like pencil skirts, knit dresses, more trousers, polo shirts, and a trench (done Posen-style, with lots of tiers). Then came the vivid colors and pretty dresses so beloved by the party girls—like the chain mail, argyle dress that Karolina Kurkova had swinging down the runway. Were there a few sour notes? The orange fantail coat and the patchwork-and-pastiche dresses needed to shed some of their excess. But Posen proved himself again with the palate-clearing closer—a trio of elegant black evening gowns, each ornamented with a billowing cloud of a cape that had even this jaded crowd oohing in admiration.</p></div>"
1,fall,2005,f2005,a-f-vandevorst,"When Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst played to their strengths—delicate lingerie, smart tailoring, soft fabrics contrasted with stiff ones—their fall collection was great. They got off to a fine start with a camel group: a wrap coat, a full skirt, a backless fur gilet, and cozy cable sweaters that looked just right on the ice (the show was presented on a skating rink).</p><p>Where the A.F. Vandevorst designers stumbled was in the middle. It’s hard to picture their customer, a romantic tomboy of Belgian extraction, going for garish patterns or having much need for to-the-floor frocks. So a series of seventies-era tapestry prints was something of a misstep, especially one long halter dress suspended by a strand of faux pearls. The look worked somewhat better later in the presentation in black, but it didn't have the swing of a jet silk cocktail dress with lace at the neckline and hem, or a gray wrap skirt fastened with an oversize safety pin and worn with a simple black crew neck.</p><p>Many of the pieces were accessorized with furry boots and Mickey Mouse ears. The former looked spunky, but the latter seemed little more than a silly distraction.</p></div>"
2,fall,2005,f2005,akris,"Since the Swiss label Akris, designed by Albert Kriemler, entered the Paris scene, it has quietly garnered an impressive reputation for stealthily luxurious clothes that also happen to sell like crazy. So what's the secret? A conundrum that tangentially reveals a lot about our times, as it happens. For the buzz (or, more accurately, the high-frequency bat squeak) about Akris lies in the paradox that it's off the radar: nonfashion fashion. At a time when seeking out label-free anonymity in clothes is beginning to seem, contradictorily, fashionable, the collection is a need-to-know resource.</p><p>For fall, Akris certainly is a place for women who can't find a nifty pantsuit to look. (And how many millions are we?) Cut with a tight, short double-breasted jacket and a slimly flared trouser in pistachio cotton-cashmere corduroy, it's an outfit guaranteed to send girlfriends into fits of ""where did you get that?"" distraction. Same with the velvet versions in subtle slate and duck blues.</p><p>And while we're at it, there are beautifully unidentifiable coats to check out here. Take one in gray, with a raised waist, a subtle flare, and a yoke in back. Or another cut into a narrow collarless early-sixties couture shape, which makes a nice nod to the season without screeching ""mod."" Or yet again, a slim man's overcoat that transcends trend.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""nkvu5h""></div></div><p>These are pieces the nonfashion-fashion hunter is going to feel mighty pleased to have bagged—now, and next year, too. As for the rest, the quietly textured wrapped knits and the separates, like jersey fit-and-flare skirts, are minted for another, more conservative market. But the fact that Akris can attract both kinds of women (all of whom are fleeing from excess, yet willing to invest) explains the health of the company's bottom line.</p></div>"
3,fall,2005,f2005,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti knows her niche, which she carved out a decade ago with an ingénue princess coat and a chiffon dress. By applying smart design tactics, she's managed to trim that template to whatever trend happens to be in the air at the time, whether that be Courtney Love grunge, boho folklore, or ladylike dressiness. This season of course, we're coming out of the fifties and taking a turn north-northwest by way of Russia, and Ferretti is putting astrakhan collars on felted coats and dark prints on dirndls, popping passementerie trimmings on belted jackets, and grounding the look in knee-high flat suede boots.</p><p>Such trend-gathering inevitably picks up cues from the current leaders of the pack, so Prada and Lanvin influences are feeding into Ferretti's neatly finished tweed and grosgrain beribboned day look. More interesting is how the designer is expanding her own signatures. After the day section of her show, she turned down the lights and spotlit a separate evening collection that showcased the red carpet relevance of her pretty way with a chiffon evening dress. For young actresses who yearn for something other than a gussied-up mermaid gown, Ferretti is increasingly a lady to run to. Her cloudy champagne- and mushoom-hued dresses, sprinkled with sprigs of silver sequins or minutely pleated à la Fortuny looked great.</p></div>"
4,fall,2005,f2005,alessandro-dell-acqua,"This season, Alessandro Dell'Acqua added a hefty dose of gypsy skirts, peasant blouses, and Milan's other current idée fixe, the Spencer military jacket, to his signature floaty chiffon dresses. The additions, timely as they were, couldn't keep this collection from feeling slight. With Dell'Acqua, though, that's sort of the point: He designs for young women who want to show off their bodies, at least as much as their clothes.</p><p>Come fall, those women will be swinging, sixties style, in short Empire-line dresses worn with thick tights, lamé tunics, and slipdresses, or metallic foil ultraminis topped with trim knit jackets. Dell'Acqua has a penchant for lacy little tops, and he showed plenty, but there's no denying he can cut a mean pair of pants, too; lean black trousers were tapered at the ankle or tucked into knee-high boots. And when his devotees get a chill—not hard in his made-for-the-boudoir frocks—they can wrap up in one of his fur coats, the smartest of which was double-breasted and silvery gray.</p></div>"
5,fall,2005,f2005,alexander-mcqueen,"Tippi Hedren and Marilyn Monroe. Biker molls and sweater girls. You got it: Alexander McQueen went to the sixties, all the way, for fall. With its filched movie and rock 'n' roll themes, the collection read as a knowing vehicle, a McQueen director's cut. Glacially restrained tailoring, early rocker chic, the classic Hollywood ball gown moment: He had 'em all. Plus great hair, great music, and a roar of old-school glamour.</p><p>But there's no such thing as a McQueen routine without a sinister psychological subtext or two. Was there a hint in the invitation—a pastiche of the film poster for <em>Vertigo</em>, superimposed with the title of another Hitchcock movie, <em>The Man Who Knew Too Much</em>? What McQueen knows shows aplenty. His combined knowledge of Savile Row tailoring and Parisian couture means he can scissor an impeccably narrow gray tweed coat or a nipped-waist pencil skirtsuit, and put sizzle into period sobriety. The same goes for his showstopper Charles James-meets-Marilyn evening gowns, with their strapless sculpted fishtails and ""Happy birthday, Mr. President"" spangles.</p><p>But there's an underlying strain in all this knowingness, too. At a time when fashion demands commercial reality, theatrics alone can't carry a show. McQueen, perhaps with a weary sense of show 'em what they want, also put out a lot (Navajo blankets, tasseled suede circa <em>The Misfits</em>), which turned parts of the presentation into a merchandise run-through of dubious taste. A cynical trotting out of an overextended theme isn't what the fashion world expects of Alexander McQueen. We know; he knows: He's bigger than that. So was that why, to the sounds of Elvis echoing through the hall, he left the building without comment?</p></div>"
6,fall,2005,f2005,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Each of the 24 looks in the Alexandre Herchcovitch collection was followed down the runway by a musician or musicians: an accordionist, a human beat box, an opera singer, a banjo player, a fiddle-horn duo. ""Each outfit has its own serenade,"" Herchcovitch explained backstage, but when you put all those sounds together, you ended up with cacophony.</p><p>Luckily, the heavily layered and ruffled show was easier on the eyes than the ears—despite the designer's claim that ""the mix of sounds equates to the fashion mix."" The pairings—a frilly chiffon blouse with a voluminous back-bustled houndstooth skirt, or a pastel camouflage-print eyelet jacket with knickers—were generally both challenging and charming, if sometimes over the top. And many of the pieces, like a full-backed trench in a warp-print floral, would stand well on their own.</p><p>The finale dresses, of cut-out latex (one of Herchcovitch's favorite materials) in rustic patterns, were as light and sweet as meringues.</p></div>"
7,fall,2005,f2005,ann-demeulemeester,"Usually, the most direct route to understanding an Ann Demeulemeester collection is to get the T-shirt. This season, she'd printed a cameo of angelic children by the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron on her standard white tank. “I was feeling for something poetic and fragile,” she said. “A bit like Victorian innocence. Beautiful, but contemporary, too.”</p><p>So that explains how a new, bunchy form bubbled up in the midsection between the textured leathers and solid biker boots Demeulemeester always shows. It was her way of tuning in to the raised waists and pouf skirts of the season for her resolutely alternative audience.</p><p>The real substance of the collection, though, was in everything else. Taken apart, Demeulemeester's layers speak for themselves. Her military jackets and redingotes in parchment-colored goatskin or ink-dark wool cut an excellent swagger, while her traily, washed-satin under-pieces had a romantic femininity. But most welcome of all were the huge, fiercely glossy scarves, made out of multiple strands of alpaca wound around her models. On a subzero Paris night, that was one idea that had her audience instantly sold.</p></div>"
8,fall,2005,f2005,anna-sui,"Anna Sui's muse for fall was Louise Nevelson, a member of the junk-art movement whose found-object sculptures are an apt metaphor for Sui's own design sensibility. A pasticheuse of the top order, she layered a pile of chunky gold chains and a foot-high fur toque on top of an Empire-waist connect-the-dot-print dress worn with fishnets and midheel loafers. And that was just for starters. An eclectic parade of menswear fabrics, butterfly prints, and metallic lamé followed.</p><p>Nevelson was at her peak in the late sixties, a period Sui has mined for inspiration many times before, and a few of the looks in this show have become signatures of sorts for the designer: the mumsy bouclé suit, the chiffon baby doll smock, the librarian's bow blouse. Into the mix, Sui tossed era-appropriate bandanas knotted underneath the chin, opaque op-art tights, and pendant necklaces, as well as some up-to-the-second strappy fur boots. Put together, it all made for one head-spinning collage.</p></div>"
9,fall,2005,f2005,aquascutum,"What does it say about fashion now that the sighting of a few plain, modern, well-made clothes on a runway is capable of sending a frisson of excitement through a grateful crowd? The fact that a skinny tailored black pantsuit, a charcoal-gray double-breasted military coat, and a deluxe shot taffeta parka are suddenly coming from the former fashion dead zone of Aquascutum (a British raincoat brand established, like Burberry, in the 1850's) certainly adds interest to the case.</p><p>Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler, both in their 30s, have been brought in to give Aquascutum's men's and women's labels a style makeover. Their taste is for modern urban luxe, much in the minimalist vein of Helmut Lang or Jil Sander, except that they tend to go mad with tulle-and-lace English deb dresses, too. They did a good job of abstracting ideas from Aquascutum's heritage, making a neat black coat-dress with epaulets, as well as a slew of short trenches belted over all those net dance skirts. But this launch collection wasn't quite coherent. At times it was too conceptual; take, for example, a tricky turning of jacket hems inside out to show linings. And the repetition of the Mac-and-frock look raised the curious question of why a raincoat company should be so enthusiastically pushing girly eveningwear. The truth is that what's missing from fashion now is strong, believably utilitarian daywear. If Herz and Fidler build on the few very desirable examples of that they showed in this collection, they'll be heading in a promising direction.</p></div>"
10,fall,2005,f2005,as-four,"By scheduling their show for 9:30 p.m. on the last day of New York Fashion Week, were As Four trying to make a point about their outsider status? Either way, the Gotham Hall event drew a bevy of indie-alternative luminaries, from Vincent Gallo and Lisa Marie to nightlife legends Kenny Kenny and Suzanne Bartsch (complete with family). Backstage, Kai Kühne described the theme of the collection as “a full circle: perfection from beginning to end.” Accordingly, the models walked in rings around the curved interior of the space (which meant good views for the large, enthusiastic crowd).</p><p>The quartet introduced fur this season for the first time, in the shape of an “octopus” cape of curled pelts of lilac fox, an “emperor” coat of mink, and hoods on pieces like a pink corduroy and satin coat. Hoodies and zipped windbreaker-style jackets were more down-to-earth (relatively speaking). In keeping with the week’s trends, the curved-seam pants, full at the back this season, took on the aspect of jodhpurs. Other standouts were a crazy coat-dress in patchwork Lurex (desperate housewives, indeed) and a school of evening dresses that worked an aquatic motif, trimmed with ruffled bands of pleats that floated like magical pieces of seaweed or jellyfish tentacles.</p><p>If the quartet’s spring outing felt like two steps forward, this one—despite the beauty and imagination on display—represented one step back. Some strong individual pieces aside, it felt like a rehashing of territory from two or three seasons ago. And the group’s failure to take a bow fueled ongoing speculation about a possible breakup—speculation that was confirmed three days later, when Kai announced his departure from the collective.</p></div>"
11,fall,2005,f2005,balenciaga,"Like so many other shows, Balenciaga opened with a fur-trimmed felted wool coat. But as the narrow, boxy, chrome-buckled shapes marched in, Nicolas Ghesquière pulled his collection leagues ahead of the season's fixations with ""sixties"" and ""military."" A collarless black leather coat with flattened epaulets; slender cuffed boot legs; tailored denim pantsuits with beaver collars; a tight-waist military greatcoat with quilted lapels: Within seconds, it was clear these had nothing to do with routine retro.</p><p>""It's a bit sixties, but tough too, with the black leather,"" the designer said. ""A little Françoise Hardy and Mia Farrow; but I never like to say the reference too much."" Right. His talent is for cutting straight to the point of what contemporary women want: sharply honed suits and coats that throw off a force field of sexy Parisian <em>froideur</em>. Ghesquière is beaming that controlled creativity into evening, too, making it less of a testing ground for his works in progress. He's retrieved materials like gazar and organdy from the Balenciaga archive, crafting their springy volumes into trapeze dresses with stiffly belled ""flying saucer"" hemlines (the Mia Farrow moment).</p><p>What held it all together was the synthesis of vintage couture and Ghesquière's signature sci-fi obsession. Both elements were embodied in a belted navy jacket with pockets on the sleeves and breast: It turned out to be a reworking of the uniform Cristobal Balenciaga designed for Air France in 1968, but also reflected Ghesquière's personal fascination with the space age. Fusing past and present, he is stamping a unique brand identity on Balenciaga. Not to mention demonstrating the vast distance between a true designer and those who merely hitch their wagons to a trend.</p></div>"
12,fall,2005,f2005,basso-brooke,"Bruno Basso and Christopher Brooke, though absolute beginners in the fashion whirl, are already fully paid-up members of the shock-horror school of London fashion. Their army of 6-foot female predators—dressed, from towering scraped-up hairdos to spiky toes, in psychotic lashings of all-over print—was the latest in London's long history of assaults on good bourgeois fashion taste. Is it scary to see women apparently styled after the look of Eastern European hookers? Certainly. Is it offensively misogynistic? Of course. But Basso &amp; Brooke know what they're doing: They're getting argued over with just the same amount of enthusiasm and revulsion as Giles Deacon, or Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood were in their roistering days of showing in London.</p><p>Basso &amp; Brooke won £100,000 in support and consultancies from London's Fashion Fringe competition last year, awarded on the strength of their powerfully aggressive all-over prints (which, when closely inspected, turned out to feature an array of exuberant penises). Now backed by Aeffe, and benefiting from its immaculate production, they have a whole silhouette together, involving tightly tailored leather-insert jackets, jersey leggings, and skirts with draped side swags, and of course, a complete smothering of print (chains, Pop Art faces, and harlequin checks). Though the total look is guaranteed to appall the fainthearted, it would be churlish to disparage the intensity and conviction the Saint Martins graduates threw into this show. Does it amount to a flash premonition of what fashion will look like in 2010, though? Maybe not. Shock tactics apart, Brooke sensibly acknowledged, ""It's not necessarily going to be worn as on the catwalk. We think you could easily wear one of our tuxedos with jeans.""</p></div>"
13,fall,2005,f2005,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria has built a thriving fashion empire that encompasses numerous apparel, accessories, and fragrance lines, with the jewel in the crown being the BCBG collection he showed today in the largest Bryant Park tent to a packed, faithful audience.</p><p>For such a big show, the message was on the slim side. Azria continued to explore the light-hearted folksy theme he introduced for spring, citing Bloomsbury as an influence. But the decorative cross-cultural references, like the recurring fringed disks that swung from belts and were embroidered on coats and dresses, were oddly unspecific (American Indian? Bollywood?). The designer fared better when he stuck to simpler pieces. A Lurex-striped poet's shirt would be a great addition to any wardrobe, and his wool felt pea coats had a jazzy, youthful swing. When Azria translated the season's ubiquitous peasant skirt into dress form, as in a paprika-colored silk jersey number with delicate embroidery at neck and hem, the results were fresh and appealing.</p></div>"
14,fall,2005,f2005,behnaz-sarafpour,"""Where were the coats?"" an editor asked as Behnaz Sarafpour's audience filed out of Splashlight Studios on, as fate would have it, a balmy afternoon. It's hot in the desert, which flashed by on a video projection at the end of the runway, but not in New York, not in the winter—the season for which the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist was ostensibly designing.</p><p>Sarafpour's Arabian sojourn did encompass a few good-looking coats, including a shearling, an exploded houndstooth, and a black style (which would have been stronger minus the white furniture tassels), but on the whole, the collection failed to hit its mark. There were smart cloqué jackets and on-the-money full skirts (some with coin embellishments in keeping with the Bedouin theme), but pants—the kind working women can wear to the office—were also missing. The designer's cropped versions, cutely paired with the babouches models wore on their feet, were skewed a little young.</p><p>Party time, however, was a different story. One black velvet dress with satin straps was exquisitely hand painted, and the show ended on a high note, with a metallic blue ombré one-shoulder coin gown.</p></div>"
15,fall,2005,f2005,bill-blass,"The mood at a Bill Blass show is traditionally one of uptown appropriateness. But for fall, both the guest list (Janet Jackson and Dr. Ruth Westheimer, suggesting all kinds of wardrobe-malfunction scenarios) and the soundtrack (heavy on the Scissor Sisters) indicated that Michael Vollbracht was heading in a new direction.</p><p>Backstage, Vollbracht's muse, Karen Bjornson, spoke about the collection's shorter, more youthful proportions, and the designer extolled the virtues of his ""narrow and long"" silhouette, which were evident in the strong opening segment—a natty (rainbow) pinstripe suit and trim snakeskin pieces were particularly strong. One of Vollbracht's white cashmere toggle coats would look great on a stroll up Museum Mile, especially if accessorized with one of Carlos Falchi's big Mongolian bags, which added zip to tweedy daytime looks. Evening highlights included a short, beaded black slip dress, a full-skirt LBD with V-neck and bows at the hip, and a long, crepe silk gown with embroidered bodice.</p><p>There were, however, a lot of misses along the way: Karen Elson, in a gazar shirt and taffeta ball skirt of epic proportions, looked like a character who had strayed from the pages of a fifties etiquette book. And, with no consistency of ornamentation, the finale seemed aimless—a dress parade in search of a theme, like characters in search of an author.</p></div>"
16,fall,2005,f2005,bottega-veneta,"It used to be that fashion labels would gradually boost their sales by adding bags to their repertoires. Bottega Veneta is reversing that old order. It already has the wildly successful bags, to which it's added a small selection of clothes; for fall, the ultraluxurious Italian leather-goods company presented its first full, day-through-evening collection.</p><p>What kind of top-to-toe look works for the many women addicted to Bottega Veneta's soft, intricately handmade wares? The answer for day, according to designer Tomas Maier, is a restrained, slick city silhouette of belted shearlings, neat suits, and fit-and-flare gray tweed coats, followed up with easy full-skirt jersey dresses, sheer sweaters, and chiffon kilts. He left plenty of time to admire the bags, with their leather flower appliqués and the steep Spiga loafers embedded with Bottega's signature woven <em>intrecciato</em> in the toe.</p><p>The problems came when Maier moved into a long parade of eveningwear. He certainly has an eye for a seductive evening item—whether that be a velvet knee boot with a flower-painted stacked heel, a high twenties sandal, a tiny silver stingray pochette, or a horde of jeweled wooden bangles. But when it came to the credibility-straining, vaguely caftan-inspired velvet pieces and jersey dresses—well, compared to the bags, shoes, and jewelry, they couldn't help but seem like accessories after the fact.</p></div>"
17,fall,2005,f2005,boudicca,"Londoners Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby brought their act this season to New York for the first time, showing 24 precision-cut pieces in a palm-frond-decorated room at the Soho Grand Hotel.</p><p>The (almost) all black collection perfectly captured the strengths of the line, which marries the aggressive—knifelike pleats, pointed shoulders, militaristic fringed epaulets—with the hopelessly romantic (layers of lace floating down from leather waistbands and around strictly tailored suits). Jackets and skirts were embroidered with words and quotes from sources as diverse as Morrissey and Visconti, while surreal ""exploding"" eyepieces were balanced by corsages.</p><p>Boudicca is not for the faint of heart (the label is, after all, named for an ancient British warrior queen), but there were streamlined pieces here that could be incorporated into many a wardrobe. A three-pocket coat had classic proportions, wool jackets were nipped attractively at the waist, while a cropped jacket in a varnishy Lurex looked as light as paper. Broach and Kirkby also revisited their signature puffer, this time in embossed brown leather.</p></div>"
18,fall,2005,f2005,bruno-pieters,"After training with Christian Lacroix, Belgian newcomer Bruno Pieters jumped into Paris fashion at the deep end with two haute couture collections—a project soon abandoned in favor of ready-to-wear, which he launched in 2003. What makes him interesting to watch now is his feel for structure, a key trend of the season.</p><p>Pieters' fall collection was, he said, inspired by the films of Jean Cocteau, especially ""their sense of drama and dreamy effects."" His nod to the twenties was evident in the hairstyling, modeled after photographer Lee Miller's, and prints adapted from Art Deco patterns, but apart from these decorative elements, there was little obvious reference to the stated theme. That didn't matter. Though the rhythm of the show was off—hooded jersey drapes, a shearling coat, and a lone black leather pants ensemble were interspersed with tailored suits and jackets—Pieters demonstrated an assured, delicate hand. His best pieces had a timeless quality that evoked not so much Cocteau as the century- and genre-skipping movie <em>Orlando</em>: Light, feminine dresses, brocade coats, and pannier and bell skirts suggested everything from a modern-day Marie Antoinette to a contemporary Daisy Buchanan.</p></div>"
19,fall,2005,f2005,burberry-prorsum,"""I was thinking of sixties London, Marianne Faithfull, and Yorkshire, where I come from,"" were the words an overwhelmed Christopher Bailey managed to emit before disappearing under an avalanche of well-wishers and TV cameras after his show. Bombarding him from all sides, the accolades were heartfelt: What the boy is doing at Burberry Prorsum is a lovely, straight-up Brit-mix of classics understandable the world over.</p><p>Perching on plaid stools, like country house guests at a grouse moor picnic, Bailey's audience was treated to a rendition of Ossie Clark-style print Empire-line dresses, brass-buttoned military-influenced coats, tweedy plaids, and layerings of striped knits and scarves. His talent is that he makes it all look light, contemporary, and accessibly ageless, which is never easy when dealing with the potentially lumpen basics of British retro. Bailey's knack is gently modernizing and morphing the standards, like putting flare into a pea coat, or fusing a Mongolian lamb edging onto a tan leather jacket, and fastening it with horn duffel coat toggles. His dresses, too, go one better than mere reproductions of the ethnic vintage smocks and scrappy flower-print dresses young girls are currently snapping up at Portobello market. Burberry's versions come in finely pleated chiffons, oak leaf and flower prints, or beautiful panne velvet, and when he adds knee-high cross-laced Victorian boots, and tosses a coat on top, it's an irresistible look.</p></div>"
20,fall,2005,f2005,calvin-klein-collection,"Francisco Costa's four-season tenure at Calvin Klein has produced collections that have both delighted and disappointed. (Part of his challenge was that fashion was having a maximal moment, while the Klein label has always been about minimalism.) But something changed with this show, which was full of signs that Costa is now really ready to flex his muscles. In a week where many designers seemed to be searching for an identity—and channeling someone else's look while they figure it out—Costa decided to stay true to the Calvin Klein brand: clean, supple, luxurious clothes made for city life.</p><p>Costa produced a fall wardrobe that was rich in detail, finish, and texture, with a slim, somewhat sixties silhouette, counterpointed with the occasional controlled bursts of volume. There were exemplary ink-navy suits, sleek and streamlined, with small jackets, and skirts that finished just above the knee. (One jacket had a mink hood attached, making it look simultaneously sporty, practical, and decadent.) There were some wonderful coats: linear funnel neck numbers constructed from square panels of black cashmere, or cut from caramel patent leather, and an A-line fur that combined mink and shearling. Even in its most basic moments—the gleaming satin roll necks, and the lean pants—this collection was imbued with the spare, architectonic look that Calvin Klein pioneered way back when, and which now seems more relevant than ever.</p></div>"
21,fall,2005,f2005,carolina-herrera,"When a show works, there's always one outfit that serves to underscore what makes the whole thing so right. That moment came at Carolina Herrera's fall 2005 collection with a look described in the program notes as a mahogany moiré strapless gown with fluted skirt. Stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, this exquisitely constructed evening dress was the perfect distillation of everything for which Herrera stands: old-world (but most definitely not old-fashioned) charm and elegance that have been glossily brought bang up to date.</p><p>Herrera also focused on what to wear during the day, imbuing those clothes with a 1940's feel without making them look retro. Most effective were what she called her trumpet skirts (fitted across the hips before flaring out sassily over the knees) and a slew of tweed hunting suits—in particular, one that came in a yellow windowpane check. Body-conscious and streamlined, yet without sacrificing any prettiness, this is what constitutes modern power dressing. Despite the richness of Herrera's fabrics—and ""richness"" is the word, what with a lavish lynx fur, a charcoal broadtail dress, and a beautiful, raspberry abstract-print silk used for a cocktail dress and a sweeping ball skirt—the final effect was chic, but never flashy.</p></div>"
22,fall,2005,f2005,celine,"A model in a black wrapped coat, violet shell, and teal pants, with a navy crocodile purse clutched in one hand, made a reasonable enough opening for Roberto Menichetti's second Celine collection. In a retreat from the perplexing debut he presented for spring, fall veered toward uncontroversial, middle-range clothes, and offered an uninterrupted view of the house's latest handbags.</p><p>Indeed, enameled chain-link shoulder bags and squared-off crocodile doctor bags embellished with tiny buckled luggage straps often seemed to take precedence over the clothes. Maybe, though, that was the point. Michael Kors, the previous designer at the house, brought a degree of sporty internationalism to the label. But Celine was once a bastion of bourgeois fashion refusal, and finding a credible way to go forward presents a dilemma.</p><p>Menichetti is not the dramatic type to reshape a house in his own image. So he compromised by sending out a polite take on stripped-down conservative dressing: suits and coats with dyed-fox collars, gored A-line skirts, flared jersey dresses, and little embellished knits. Staying with the safe and predictable, he elongated many of the same shapes for evening. This sort of luxe simplicity is difficult to carry off convincingly. For one thing, it requires perfect pitch in color, which Menichetti's jarring contrasts of orange, purple, teal, fuchsia, and black failed to achieve.</p></div>"
23,fall,2005,f2005,chaiken,"Chaiken has come a long way, baby, since the collection launched ten years ago in January at Barneys New York. Originally known for fab-fitting pants, the line Julie Chaiken and her creative director, Jeff Mahshie, showed for fall, had plenty of fashion flair. In addition to familiar and dependable basics—from V-necks and cardigan jackets to slim Capris and full-cuffed trousers—there were this season's must-have tulip skirts, Empire-waist coats, and colors that positively popped. One highlight among several charming evening numbers: a sapphire velvet cocktail frock cinched with a forest-green extra-wide obi that would look great on Chaiken devotee and front-row guest Mary-Louise Parker.</p></div>"
24,fall,2005,f2005,chalayan,"It's extraordinary to watch how an avant-garde talent like Hussein Chalayan has talked himself around to presenting a collection so polished it almost looked like haute chic. As in, a pearl gray, three-quarter-length coat, traced with white satin binding, and finished with a snug shearling collar. Or a narrow black wool cocktail dress with a square neckline and black lace sleeves. Or a belted raincoat with a swaggering volume in the back.</p><p>Forget for a second that Chalayan also sent out sculpted boleros made out of carpet, which swooped up in humps above the head. Those came as reminders of the enigmatic, conceptual work he was producing at the beginning of his 10-year career. (His seminal pieces are now gathered in an anniversary retrospective at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands.) However amazing—and whatever they mean—those moments should not distract from the extraordinary maturity of this collection. Chalayan has now developed into a designer who, like Nicolas Ghesquière and Olivier Theyskens, has found an intelligent, inspiring way to revive the art of refined dressing. Not young, not old, but somehow classy, it made this show one of the definitive thrills of the Paris season.</p></div>"
25,fall,2005,f2005,chanel,"With their ironed hair, pale lips, and exaggerated doe-eye makeup, the leggy girls on Karl Lagerfeld's Chanel runway were channeling Penelope Tree, the iconic and kooky sixties model. And in their black-and-white mini-kilts, abbreviated A-line dresses, and pleated cocktail hour ""gym slips,"" they looked as though they had stepped from a David Bailey print. In fact, there was only one long dress in the collection—a drift of pale-gray cloudy chiffon prettily garlanded with ropes of seed pearls—but its diaphanous skirt revealed a mini beneath.</p><p>Even the signature Chanel camellias, nestling as appliqués in textured salt-and-pepper tweed, were abstracted into something resembling a naive daisy, a flower symbol that carries with it more than a hint of the youthquake sixties fashions of Mary Quant and Courrèges. Of course, in Lagerfeld's deft hands this was no mere history lesson. The designer used those schoolgirl-short looks to focus on the leg with wrinkling kid boots so high that they disappeared beneath those tiny skirts' hems, or leggings in pale gold or silvery Lurex knits. Jeans and knickerbockers were cut as tight as hosiery and decorated with a flourish of Chanel's black satin hair ribbon at the knee.</p><p>With a major Chanel retrospective opening in May at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, Lagerfeld also delved into Coco Chanel's history—specifically a 1920's liaison with the Duke of Westminster that saw her borrowing knits and tweedy pieces from his chic country wardrobe. Lagerfeld feminized his layered cardigan and plus fours with scarves twinkling with diamond camellias and topped them with adorable newsboy caps, knit cloches, or floppy berets. But the androgyny didn't stop there. This is the 50th anniversary of the quilted, chain-strung bag that is so emblematic of the house, and Lagerfeld reintroduced it—in a battered vintage-look leather set to become an instant must-have—on the men in his show, who wore them with a swagger, slung across their shoulders and backs.</p></div>"
26,fall,2005,f2005,chloe,"The thing about Chloé is the way it all seems to happen so naturally—the easy flow of the house style, the effortless blend of prettiness and practicality—without any of the hard-core hysterics so often attached to fashion behavior. That ethos applied in more ways than one to the handling of the fall collection, which coincided with another natural event at the house: the return of Phoebe Philo after giving birth to her daughter, Maya.</p><p>After her three-month maternity leave (and glowing with health from a recent holiday in Antigua with her mother and baby), Philo watched the show from front row and loudly applauded her posse of deputies when they ran out to take a bow at the end. ""I'm so touched by what they did!"" she exclaimed backstage, trying to deflect attention onto the compadres who finished the collection in her absence.</p><p>The clothes turned out to be an easy collage of Chloé's hot sellers: slouchy skirts with a band in the hem, neat little canvas Victorian jackets, and cool navy and black military coats, menswear pants, beautiful dresses, and a roster of the boots, shoes, and bags that cause wait-list mayhem the world over. Plus some exceptionally beautiful white lace Victorian dresses, virginal without being revoltingly cute (and bang on target for the season) to keep things ticking along.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""q3wud7v""></div></div><p>In other words, there were no hideous disappointments or fallings from grace; plenty to buy, plenty for fashion editors to love. In truth, Chloé is a brand flying so high it can afford to stay in ""team"" holding pattern, at least for one season. But much as Philo blushed and tried to shove the limelight away from herself, it was no use. The show served merely to add ""loyalty-inspiring manager"" to her string of cool achievements. From any angle, she has star quality, and in a very modern sense. No wonder her bosses are bending over backward for her. From now on, she's going to be designing from an office in London, where she can be happy: designing, managing, and being a natural mom.</p></div>"
27,fall,2005,f2005,christian-dior,"John Galliano, subdued? Surely not. But it's true: A back-to-basics attitude is sweeping through the house of Dior. Abandoning the freaky makeup and vertiginous footwear of so many seasons past, Galliano turned his fall ready-to-wear show into an exhaustive commercial workout of his last couture collection—from the mod sixties vibe right through to the romantic Empire look.</p><p>It started with black-and-white striped, laddered Edie Sedgwick mohair knits, worn with baker-boy caps, flat, pointy crocodile knee boots, and fishnets. Those quickly became a device for showing off the staple jackets Galliano has brought to the party: cutaway tail coats, biker jackets with Napoleonic collars, and his reinterpretation of Dior's seminal New Look Bar jacket. From there, he segued into shearling aviators, and brown crocodile and leather, sending out a high-belted maxi coat that knowingly checked another box on the season's trend sheet.</p><p>Next up: gorgeous russet, dusty-pink, and burnt-orange velvets, followed by dresses in silver/gray, delicate pink, and grape, distilling the rococo delicacy of his couture into believable partywear. The remix heavily underscored the cash value of the wearable classics Galliano has added to the house's bottom line, which have been willfully obscured over years of apparently insane experimentation. So here, at last, is an accurate picture of Dior ready-to-wear. It is what it is; but we will have to wait for Galliano's next couture show to glimpse where it's going next.</p></div>"
28,fall,2005,f2005,christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix followed up his January haute couture spectacular with a ready-to-wear show that, while more rigorously edited and subdued than usual, served up some exceptionally chic and romantic clothes.</p><p>Lacroix opened with cocktail suits scissored from brocades and shot taffetas, often lavished with unusually colored furs (strawberry fox, greige mink) and cut with a Parisian flourish. His magpie eye drew on a multitude of references, including twenties haute couture flappers (for a black beaded frock or coat splashed with giant white sequin daisies); the work of cult seventies designer Jean Muir (for a slim coat in grass-green perforated suede); a felt Victorian cape (for the collar detail on a sleek black velvet coat); and a Japanese kimono print (for a lightly pleated skirt tied with an obi sash).</p><p>As he has for the past two seasons, Lacroix showed some of his men's looks among this fine-feathered flock. Red velvet jeans and a navy pea coat worn with trainers in shades of mossy velvet; coral charms on a chain slung across dirty pastel fatigue pants; and a nineteenth-century-flavored military greatcoat set off with a beaded cap all successfully suggested Lacroix's own quirky sartorial image.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4oyzha""></div></div><p>For his ladies, jewel-clasped velvet ribbons in clashing colors (used to anchor the bodice on an evening dress or as a flourish on a lapel) and cloudy puffs of tulle over contrasting under-dresses were both delightful ideas taken from his couture show. And Lacroix's stellar finale of evening dresses—in eye-popping Pepto-Bismol chiffon finished with a black velvet bow, for instance, or mauve crushed velvet trimmed with the lavish Edwardian passementerie that is everywhere this season—exuded off-beat charm and proved the master couturier's touch.</p></div>"
29,fall,2005,f2005,clements-ribeiro,"It was Frida Kahlo from topknot to wedge platform toe at Clements Ribeiro, that is except for the merciful omission of the monobrow. It's not hard to see why the couple glanced Frida's way. Inacio Ribeiro is himself South American by birth, and in any case, an arty-crafty version of the forties has always suited the CR duo. So, for fall, it was (as ever) all about a floral vintage-look dress, skirts with flowers appliquéd in tape, and a few windowpane-check tweeds (seasonally inspired by Kahlo's lover, Diego Rivera).</p><p>Clements Ribeiro are practiced at doing this sort of thing and know well how to turn out a pretty, non-tarty party number (this season it was a peach chiffon flapper dress with spangle-edged ruffles). What's new is the way the couple have been steadily building their core business into a brand that now encompasses leather goods and fur. The huge wedge butterfly-decorated sandals, high-heel Mexicana boots, chunky bags, and a feathered fox coat testified to that.</p></div>"
30,fall,2005,f2005,comme-des-garcons,"Here come the brides. Comme des Garçons was an invitation to an extraordinary wedding of high concept and beautiful clothes—romantic, Victorian-flavored creations of lace and ruffle. Each model wore an antique lace veil, trailing to the ground, surmounted by ever more colorful and evocative circlets of flowers as the procession went on. Their faces were powdered white and traced with sequins around the eyes. Their outfits formed a poetic sequence: leg-of-mutton sleeves, amazing patchworks of fan pleating, tulle, satin, and daisy chains of pure white lace.</p><p>To encounter religion in a house of fashion, in times like these, is potentially controversial. Rei Kawakubo declared that her nuptial rites were about ""anticonservatism,"" but they evoked not a shred of confrontational politics. Understanding that was a question of sight and sound. The brides advanced to the strains of High Church organ music, with occasional patched-in sounds of marriage celebrations from Gypsy, Jewish, Mexican, and Caribbean weddings. The music formed a counterpoint to the visual impact of the headdresses, which burst into garlands of paper flowers, tinsel, and chains: a symbolic tour of the power of love, hope, and reconciliation in any culture you care to mention. In a riven world, it takes a wise woman to point to that.</p></div>"
31,fall,2005,f2005,costello-tagliapietra,"Affectionately known as ""the jersey boys,"" Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra have no ties to the Garden State. What they do have is a devotion to jersey fabrics, which they celebrated in an accomplished, 24-piece all-knit collection.</p><p>While their spring show featured dresses almost exclusively, the duo expanded their reach with their sophomore collection, showing pants, jackets (like a short clay-colored model), dramatic capes, and belted coats that wrapped around the body like an embrace. As for the dresses, they were expertly executed: The designers achieved soft, supple, drapey effects, as well as more structured ones, making a famously clingy fabric practical and wearable. Floaty jersey lace was worked into swingy skirts, while heavier pieces, in a muted palette of soft clay, loden, and oatmeal, had surprising, sporty pockets. The finale, a red wrap-top floor-length gown with pockets above the high waist, was an absolute valentine.</p></div>"
32,fall,2005,f2005,costume-national,"Designer Ennio Capasa cited enduring sixties boho icon Marianne Faithfull as a starting point for his Costume National fall show, which had ""folk chic"" in the details. With its willowy chiffon dresses worn with seventies boots, and romantic <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> Russian coats (accessorized with foxy Cossack hats or oversize fedoras), the collection seemed ripe for Sienna Miller—the latest in an It girl continuum stretching back to Faithfull herself.</p><p>Capasa captured the <em>Mitteleuropa</em> flavor of the moment thanks to strict tailoring, embellished with hussar military frogging details and this season's ubiquitous passementerie and crochet embroideries—very much part of his house's handcraft vocabulary. But he wanted a look that was ""graphic outside and very fluid inside,"" so he underscored that shapely tailoring with saucy peasant dresses built around fitted and corseted velvet midriffs, in chiffons that were printed in various different paisleys.</p><p>For all its boho credentials, the collection was ultimately geared to a hippie with a very heightened sense of luxe—from the strips of black mink worked into a coat's sleeves to the whorls of golden sequins on the finale's siren sheath gown.</p></div>"
33,fall,2005,f2005,d-g,"Kate Moss and her hard-partying London crew are currently obsessed with the glitter years (it was the dress code for her latest birthday bash), so Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were heading in the right general direction when they sprayed their runway gold, put up a giant disco ball, and blasted T. Rex and Roxy Music at their D&amp;G show. As a device, an escape into seventies kitsch promised a bit of light relief from the dark ponderings that have overtaken grown-up fashion this season.</p><p>But what turned up on the runway paid scant heed to glam-rock accuracy. It was more a trawl through every mother's nightmare of an aspiring underage rock chick's wardrobe: bottom-skimming baby dolls, punky ultramini kilts, chaps, that sort of thing. The sequined eye makeup, a blue dyed monkey fur, a swaggery green Napoleonic maxicoat, and a floor-sweeping velvet cloak did pay direct homage to Biba, circa 1972, but what teen would know or care? What matters was that, as always, there was plenty of stuff to keep the D&amp;G juniors happy, including a troop of gold-painted drainpipe jeans, which could look annoyingly great on a 15-year-old.</p></div>"
34,fall,2005,f2005,daryl-k,"At the beginning of this decade, New York's finest pant makers looked set to dominate the fashion scene, with editors, retailers, and celebrities extolling the virtues of Katayone Adeli, Bruce, and Daryl K. From that list, only the latter, designed by Daryl Kerrigan, has stayed afloat—and even she had to shutter her New York store, fold her business, and lie low for a while.</p><p>With this collection, her second since returning to the scene, Kerrigan showed why she's been missed, sending out clothes that were feminine, uncomplicated, and effortlessly hip. The designer did sharp versions of what have emerged as this fall's key items: a flowing jersey dress (she slipped hers over stovepipe pants); a tightly belted big coat (cut from dotted melton wool); and a voluminous blouson jacket, here in winter white reverse shearling. (She also used sheepskin to trim a great slouchy black leather shoulder bag.) There were also plenty of easy wardrobe basics—drawstring cardigans, knotted tanks, boxy jackets—designed to be thrown together on a whim.</p><p>But there's also been a shift in Kerrigan's attitude. Yes, there's still an element of downtown grunge running through this label, like a nagging musical refrain from band du jour the Killers. But everything is much less self-consciously cool now. What with her color palette (earthy browns mixed with pink and lilac), and her weathered, worn silks and wools, this was a collection that could have quietly, but confidently, slipped from show to street in the blink of an eye.</p></div>"
35,fall,2005,f2005,derek-lam,"Since catapulting onto the New York scene five seasons ago, Derek Lam has earned himself quite a following for his ability to update and reinterpret classics from other eras. For fall, the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist took inspiration from California beach towns in the late sixties—Topanga, Salinas, Carmel—and the artsy magpie style of the locals.</p><p>With a ""California Dreamin'"" cover and a Mercury Rev song borrowed from the <em>Laurel Canyon</em> soundtrack to set the mood, Lam sent out drop-waist silk shirtdresses, grandpa cardigans, prairie skirts, and pleated trousers in ""laundered"" shades of blue, red, saffron, and brown. Yes, he played with the exaggerated volumes so popular this season—organza slipdresses blossomed at the waist, and models tucked their hands into deep pockets—but his experiments were relaxed and easy, not tricky. Details, many of which looked Spanish colonial and Central American in origin, came in the way of turquoise beading, strappy leather sandals dotted with jewels, and too-familiar blanket wraps.</p><p>Not as focused as last season, the collection also seemed unrealistic for residents of colder regions. But that may have been intentional: Lam is a California boy, after all, one who's been known to wear his own sandals well into the New York fall.</p></div>"
36,fall,2005,f2005,diane-von-furstenberg,"The grand tour Diane von Furstenberg took for spring deposited her on the Russian Steppes. Citing the great heroines of that country's literature as inspiration in her program notes, she not only hit upon what is shaping up as a big fall trend, but also delivered one of her most consistent collections in seasons.</p><p>The show opened with one of von Furstenberg's signature wrap dresses trussed up with military details, but the Revolution was just the beginning. Cossack tapestries were transformed into snug knit suits or slim pants, some striped down the side with blue ribbon, that were worn underneath silk tunics. Cocktail dresses were appliquéd with gold sequins, and a nubby silver tweed was worked into coats. A few peasant tops and skirts delved into territory first charted by Yves Saint Laurent in his 1976-77 Russian collection, but von Furstenberg is not the only one to follow him down that path. And for those cold winter nights, she whipped up a faux fur that looked like it could keep Anna Karenina both warm and in fashion on her long train journey.</p></div>"
37,fall,2005,f2005,dkny,"Last season, Donna Karan abandoned the runway and showed her DKNY collection on mannequins during Sunday brunch at Pastis, in Manhattan's fashionably overrun Meatpacking District. For fall, the mannequins were back (styled by Patricia Field), with the venue and time changed to 5 o'clock cocktails at the Dorothy Parker-haunted Algonquin. But if an air of Round Table exclusivity was the goal, it was not achieved. Dozens of people attempted to circle the room, tripping over photographers and prone forms in an attempt to get a halfway-decent look at some pretty clothes.</p><p>On view were the season's requisite tiered peasant skirts, paired with fitted jackets, some ruffled, almost all belted tight at the waist. Long dresses had Empire lines. A wool cape topped a blazer and cropped pants. Rabbit fur and shearling coats promised warmth, which was also evoked by the autumnal palette.</p></div>"
38,fall,2005,f2005,dolce-gabbana,"Dolce &amp; #38; Gabbana's fall show featured a double take: Was that Chloë Sevigny in the belted fur-trimmed coat, looking out from under her bouffant mane? It certainly was, busy channeling Jean Shrimpton. This was confirmed by the walls backstage, which were papered with copies of David Bailey's photographs of the Shrimp taken for <em>Vogue</em> between '61 and '64, when the two were a hot item.</p><p>The designers described their collection—full of minis and maxis, boxy jackets, Beatles caps, and tall furry hats reminiscent of the Buckingham Palace guards—as ""<em>La Dolce Vita</em> meets Swinging London."" But without knowing all that, you'd have been forgiven for thinking you'd blundered into a groovy furrier's show. Dolce &amp; Gabbana kept pretty faithful to the outline of the youthquake moment as it might have been seen from Italy—a viewpoint that encompassed both English tweeds and <em>alta moda</em> flowered dresses. But there was never, ever this much fur around in '64. The duo didn't just use it in a regular way on coats, like a Shrimpton-esque Mongolian lamb and a floor-sweeping white mink; they lavished broadtail almost everywhere, as if it were fabric. A black minidress and matching coat were only the starters: After that, there were two-tone boxy suits and narrow skirts with contrast banding picked out in fur, and trims applied everywhere.</p><p>To top all that, the show crescendoed with the label's familiar parade of Oscar gowns—this season done in white and silver, the girls standing on the mirrored runway all a-twinkle and aquiver with Austrian crystal and exotically sculpted feathers.</p></div>"
39,fall,2005,f2005,donna-karan,"Donna Karan's fall show was proof that there's no place like home. After breaking her leg in a skiing accident earlier this winter in Utah, the peripatetic designer returned to New York City with renewed focus, and it came through in her confident, sexy collection, which she called <em>Manhattan Rush</em>.</p><p>The show started with a pinstripe suit, but Karan's definition of power dressing has never been about sharp angles. A deft draper, she manipulated the stretch-wool fabric into origami flowers that graced the neckline of an off-the-shoulder jacket and the hip of a slender skirt. The rosette motif decorated a puff-skirt strapless dress, too, and lent it a hand-touched feeling. Karan played with proportion, building shirts, coats, and capelets in layers, and warded off the winter chill with hoods in iridescent taffeta; hats, the taller the better; and turned-up collars on an Elizabethan scale.</p><p>Stretch-silk goddess gowns were tricked out with too many straps and worn with frowsy, distracting gloves. In contrast, her strongest evening pieces, full-skirt jewel-tone chiffon and taffeta numbers, had the sculpted look of her daywear. And when it came time to take a well-deserved bow, Karan didn't let her broken leg stop her. Talk about the power of a woman.</p></div>"
40,fall,2005,f2005,doo-ri,"Doo-Ri Chung took quite a few confident steps forward with her fall 2005 collection, even if the footing of her models didn't always look quite so sure. They were balanced precariously on futuristic silver constructions of metal and plastic, and didn't so much strut smartly as totter tentatively down the runway.</p><p>But this is only a minor quibble. From a designer who made pastel-hued draped sporty tanks and short dresses the mainstay of her spring collection, fall was a quantum leap into new territory. Chung added short, swingy double-breasted salt-and-pepper tweed jackets that were worn with stovepipe black pants with snaps on the legs, and sinuously draped evening dresses that sleekly fell to the floor. Both the jackets and dresses were deftly embellished with Swarovski crystals, imbuing her look for next season with a certain low-key luminosity.</p><p>What was most intriguing was the way Chung balanced the qualities that women expect from cutting-edge urban fashion—sportiness and sex appeal, in equal measure—with the contemplative, cerebral nature of her own approach. The latter is a legacy from her time spent working with the late Geoffrey Beene, and there were certainly some Beene-isms evident here—notably the silver yoke neck on a gray jersey dress, or the crystal-studded bra cups on a black strapless dress. Yet Chung is also blessed with her own vision of what women want to wear right now, as evinced by a gray cashmere top, its deep V-neck traced with silver sequins, worn with an ivory silk tulip skirt, and an understated, but utterly perfect, charcoal flannel trench.</p></div>"
41,fall,2005,f2005,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten could have made a far-more uplifting case for his fall collection if only he'd run the show in reverse order. His full, floor-sweeping distressed-velvet skirt in an extraordinary shade of orange, cinched with a fuchsia satin sash and topped with a fragile black camisole embroidered with green flowers, would have made a fabulous opener. Together with another romantic, gray-beige gypsy skirt, embroidered in jet, he could have held the attention of the room. As well as added a succinct contribution to the general conversation about the desirability of long skirts for fall.</p><p>But instead, the show made a long and rather draggy journey toward those outstanding pieces. The characters on his runway looked like refugees from the <em>Mitteleuropean</em> 1940's: women with fancy bohemian pasts fallen on hard times. With poignant dance hall music playing in the background, they walked out as if bravely trying to make the best of a bad situation, in faded, fur-trimmed coats, rolled-up menswear pants, and platform shoes. Among the salt-and-pepper tweeds and voluminous raincoats, there were such tokens of lost splendor as tarnished lamé, drapey printed velvet, and cheerful folk prints. In the general drift, they seemed to be following the caravan of this fall's Russian theme. But the show's drabness was almost overwhelming, until that lovely, colorful moment at the end.</p></div>"
42,fall,2005,f2005,dsquared,"Was that a sundress on the Dsquared² runway? With maple leaves and other wholesome hallmarks of Canada, birthplace of twin designers Dean and Dan Caten? And was the model wearing modest, elbow-length gloves? Yes, yes, and yes. Milan's <em>enfants terribles</em> played down their party-boy image for fall, turning out a collection that wasn't that far from demure.</p><p>Sure, there were a few of those reliable trucker hats, but there were fedoras, as well; and the girl-meets-boy stylings were a far cry from last season's frat house antics. The Catens trotted out plenty of the pieces they're known for: cropped denim and leather pants, lumberjack plaids, and chunky sweaters (one cheeky turtleneck read: ""Jesus Loves Me""). But they were paired, this time around, with full skirts, car coats with a swing at the hem, and such ladylike accessories as fur tippets and silk scarves tied jauntily at the neck. The show closed with a series of liquid silk cocktail dresses in jewel tones which, together with a broadtail or two, conspired to elevate the proceedings even further.</p></div>"
43,fall,2005,f2005,eleykishimoto-ellesse,"Only in London could you get a fashion show staged like a play in a school hall, with a clunky ski-hut set, a painted snow-scene backdrop, and a man in a giant penguin suit playing a key role. Still, the tired fashion crowd was only too happy to sit through the half hour of silliness laid on by Eley Kishimoto as they presented their sporty collection for Ellesse. Ostensibly for winter, it's a ski collection, but judging by the fact that the girls were staggering around in high-heel pumps and swinging in and out of the hut door, as if coming and going from a party, it's hardly meant as serious piste wear.</p><p>Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto have a huge youth following in Japan, built on the appeal of their naive cartoony prints. So among the seventies-style nylon salopettes, cropped ski pants, and cute short smock dresses, there were zippy bombers, A-line skirts, and all-in-ones printed with patterns of penguins, snowy mountains, or shooting stars. All good clean fun.</p></div>"
44,fall,2005,f2005,emanuel-ungaro,"Vincent Darré, making his ill-judged debut chez Ungaro, promised to evoke the early glory years of the house, established in 1965 by Emanuel Ungaro after he left an apprenticeship at Balenciaga and was collaborating with the brilliant textile designer Sonia Knapp. The most cursory delve into Ungaro's archives would reveal a master colorist who embraced the space-age sixties, turned to Ballets Russes-inspired hippies deluxe in the seventies, reflected the overdecorated opulence of the eighties, and rediscovered an ethereal lightness of touch in the nineties. Instead of modernizing this great legacy, Darré clung to a palette of crude primaries and eye-popping brights. He opened with funnel-collar jackets and ballooning kimono coats fastened with an evening gown's obi drape that certainly nodded to Ungaro's work as Balenciaga's tailor, although clam-digger pants were an unsuccessful accompaniment. A baby-doll dress in black bubble lace with appliqués of white mink daisies provided another faint echo. From there, the show careened downhill, however, and further experiments with the season's poufy volumes sunk like overcooked soufflés. Even Darré's Diva draperies—a signature of the house for decades—looked clumsily cobbled together and would have shamed any self-respecting couture workroom.</p><p>The delightful Darré, who over the years has proved a witty and spirited stylist at houses like Moschino and Fendi, unwisely accessorized every look with his clumpy and over-scale take on Roger Vivier's iconic sixties <em>Belle de Jour</em> pump (the chic original was created for Yves Saint Laurent), which looked especially ungainly with the long evening gowns. Not that there is much salvation for a Diva-draped gown reinterpreted in dirty white leather. As his clownish models lined up, in dusty old-school fashion, across the back of a set evoking Ungaro's Avenue Montaigne flagship, the audience's stupefaction was palpable. Clearly, Darré, who has proved his credentials elsewhere, has a long way to go to inject fashion credibility into this line.</p></div>"
45,fall,2005,f2005,emilio-pucci,"With each passing season, Christian Lacroix stamps his imprimatur on Emilio Pucci with an ever-firmer hand. By opening his show with a simple black dress (albeit traced with intricate couture seams), the maverick talent took the Op Art zing out of the house—and sublimated his own wilder impulses in the process. Of course, this couldn't be expected to last, and scintillating color—think Bollywood-bright pink, scarlet, purple, and orange—soon crept into the funereal scene, if stealthily. Elegant little black dresses were partly splashed with bold Pucci swirls; covert flashes of signature printed leggings appeared between the hem of a short coat and the top of dashing black suede boots; and giant black houndstooth was overprinted to subdue the psychedelic effects of the design beneath.</p><p>Lacroix captured the voluminous spirit of the season in puffball blouson shapes—in wool or luxe duchesse satin—and in mushrooming skirts and billowing peasant blouses. Shine ignited those blocks of solid color—from lamé python prints to gold sequins tracing fissure patterns over a black satin trench coat.</p><p>The haute couturier in Lacroix let rip at night, providing temptations for a jet-set lifestyle from Ibiza to Mumbai. A skinny-rib black knit cardigan worn with a floor-length skirt in signature Pucci swirls of coral and black would be perfect for a banquet at Palazzo Pucci—and a dazzling evening gown in eye-popping orange chiffon (deftly spliced with a slither of purple as only a couturier can do) seemed destined for a red carpet moment—perhaps for Bollywood icon Aishwarya Rai?</p></div>"
46,fall,2005,f2005,emporio-armani,"Giorgio Armani presented such a vast Emporio collection on the theme of young, kooky dressing that it's hard to know how to begin to sum it up. It started with two models, in turbans, wearing tufty fake furs and flat lace-up shoes. From then on, the girls kept on coming, in pairs or trios, in sequences that went from peplum jackets and tulip skirts, to moleskin safari jackets and leather blazers, to swing coats and party dresses, then to nautical jackets, fetishy plastic Macs, chenille tiered dresses, and much, much more in the way of eveningwear.</p><p>Perhaps Armani was teasing his audience with all this to and fro between day and night, floral paisleys and plain black numbers. Lately, he's been in a mood to shake off his image as the gray, logical maestro of minimalism. His skittishness has definitely lightened things up, throwing short skirts into the mix and giving the proceedings an uncharacteristic playfulness. The show ended with a bunch of girls in crystal- and sequin-beaded dresses goofing about with Emporio Armani eyeglasses, followed by an appropriately cheery bow from the man himself.</p></div>"
47,fall,2005,f2005,etro,"It was a bit of a Dadaist experience at Etro, in more ways than one. Perhaps inspired by the nonsensical, confrontationist antics of the early twentieth century art movement, several guests were given doubled-up seat assignments, and others received ticket numbers that correlated to invisible chairs. Or maybe that was just a slip-up. In any case, after much delay, the Dada-inspired show went on, though as it turned out, not much troubled by anything more artistically challenging than a twenties interlocking concentric circle pattern.</p><p>Etro's heritage in elaborate mixed-media print and embroideries explains the hum around the label these days. At a time when pattern and color have become attractions for shoppers, burnt orange, purple, and tomato red, worked into Deco geometrics, antique Japanese embroideries, paisleys, and rose prints have an eye-catching currency. That provided material for some unique pieces, but not necessarily for a credible runway show. There were some pretty floral patchwork-print Empire-line dresses that are becoming a house signature, but there was too much eking out of ideas to sustain this presentation.</p></div>"
48,fall,2005,f2005,fendi,"Trust Karl Lagerfeld to make a witty reversal of a fashion cliché. Where once Fendi made headlines by hiding fur discreetly on the inside of casual coats, now he's done the opposite: smoothing pelts onto the outside of extravagantly oversize down puffers. That made a dramatically chic and witty opener for a collection that brought Fendi back in from the cold of its so-so fall season last year.</p><p>The other news was in the color: a darkly vibrant palette of aubergine, wine, bottle green, and browns, with which Lagerfeld worked to make fur, suede, fabric, and knit blur together so eye-deceivingly that the materials can only truly be verified by touch. Take a loden jacket, playfully extracted from Lagerfeld's Germanic past, but reshaped into a body-hugging leather-bound form, with a big collar. Part of it was apparently suede, but what of the zones that looked like dense bouclé wool? In this house, it's more likely to be some extraordinary clipped, tightly curled fur. But even from two steps away, it was impossible to tell.</p><p>As always in this ultraluxurious ready-to-wear collection, there were many stand-alone items for women who want to invest in an extraordinary fur piece rather than a slice of a theme. They included a slim military coat, unembellished except for horizontally shaved stripes and epaulets; a semisheer cardigan jacket of white Mongolian lamb; and several full-skirt coats with nipped waists. The accessories, too, had a random charm, apparently unrelated to any grand overarching theme, yet all the better for it. One pair of boots, jeweled in a kind of flowery William Morris pattern, had nothing at all to do with another that came smothered with black lace. But there was one thing they all had in common, and it's something that women can read in a flash: an off-the-scale go-get-'em factor.</p></div>"
49,fall,2005,f2005,gardem,"If fashion designers can be imagined in families, Garen Demedijian has Rick Owens for an uncle and Anne Valérie Hash as an aunt. That, at any rate, is one explanation for the urban warrior jackets, traily tops, and tattered flounced skirts that make up the Gardem look. At a distance, his layers of washed leathers and crinkled silks and faded palette of blacks, browns, and neutrals look a tad overfamiliar in that post-deconstruction vein. But close up, his pieces have a certain femininity of their own. His jackets, long in front and short and fitted in back, have an eighteenth century, fencing or riding jacket air about them. And this season he's added fur boleros and a great shaggy gray Mongolian lamb to go with his Victorian ragamuffin skirts. With the skinny satin and velvet leggings and patches of bricolage jewelry, there were enough pickings here for girls who like to collage together their own romantic rock-chick style. On the other hand, to keep attention coming his way, Demedijian needs to work harder on building the character of his collection into a distinctive personal signature.</p></div>"
50,fall,2005,f2005,giambattista-valli,"In the recent flurry of designer hirings, firings, and resignations, Giambattista Valli might have been marked down as last season's footnote: Out at Ungaro. But with remarkable speed and an extraordinary chorus of support (including Lee Radziwill and Diane Kruger in the front row, not to mention Dita Von Teese on the runway), Valli has regrouped and come back with his own signature collection in Paris.</p><p>Goodwill and friendship notwithstanding, a huge question mark hung over his debut. As one of those backroom assistants who has thus far acted as a ventriloquist for another designer's voice, what, if anything, Valli had to say on his own behalf was uncertain. A statement about modernized glamour on the one hand, and poufy, crinolined evening on the other seemed to be the essence of it, though the presentation proved the designer has gathered sophistication as well as connections along his way.</p><p>For day, he has a way with knits (balloon-sleeve cashmere sweaters) and coats that cut a sixties couture swagger in loose, minimalist camel or come belted with a swing back. His precisely fitted military jackets and officer's coats, with glamorous tab fastenings and Mongolian-lamb collars, have a close-to-the-body femininity that might please as exacting a client as Radziwill. These, several nifty tuxedos (one with a tailcoat jacket pieced in black bouclé tweed and satin), and gutsy handheld crocodile totes, gave an unexpectedly confident polish to the proceedings.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""kjtr59""></div></div><p>Still, there's a heck of a conflict going on if you're hoping to dress both Radziwill and Von Teese. Valli's Dita-inspired dresses are corseted, bustled, poufed, and crinolined to the max. Aside from those, there were a few rather good tightly draped black jersey dresses sashed with bows or sprouting tulle at the bust that announced, thank you, Ungaro, and goodnight. Valli can hardly be blamed for getting them out of his system. He'll have to figure out a few issues before next season, but kudos are due to him for getting such a show on the road in record time.</p></div>"
51,fall,2005,f2005,giles-deacon,"Giles Deacon has been interviewed for the design vacancy at Givenchy and is waiting to hear the outcome. That was the news backstage after he delivered his best show to date, a collection unmistakably designed as a set piece audition for the last empty couture seat in Paris. The challenge focused Deacon's mind on demonstrating how totally serious he is about wanting to design grown-up, even grand, clothes. For the first time in three seasons, he dispensed with his ironic British tinkerings with borderline bad taste and went straight for old-school classic chic of the kind he hopes will translate across the English Channel.</p><p>Deacon set out to show he can cut it with the best of them, meaning everything from snug riding jackets inset with velvet to well-cut pantsuits, decorative paillette cocktail dresses, and extravagant opera coats. He redirected his former experiments with volume into ballooning sleeves, bubble jackets, and puffy unpressed hems, producing shapes that directly recall the haute eveningwear of 1950's couture. Among all this, there were one or two knowing references to the design ethos of Hubert de Givenchy himself (a white puff-sleeve blouse here, an Audrey like peacoat there). Still, there was more than enough to prove that Deacon wasn't simply resorting to slavish pastiche, a design cul-de-sac that other young Givenchy incumbents have floundered in before. Increasingly, Deacon is developing his own sophisticated handwriting, particularly in the flowing, high-waisted, vaguely seventies gowns that finished the show. It remains to be seen whether Givenchy's parent, LVMH, will want to risk hiring a fourth young British Central Saint Martins graduate for the job, after John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, and Julien Macdonald. But if this collection doesn't convince the company about the caliber of Deacon's talent, nothing will.</p></div>"
52,fall,2005,f2005,giorgio-armani,"Just before the finale of the Armani show, the theater was plunged into darkness and filled with the sound of an Italian man laughing maniacally. It went on for some time. What was that? Could it have been Giorgio Armani himself, splitting his sides backstage at the thought of the bloomers he had just visited upon womankind? At any rate, the interlude provided one tenuous explanation for everything that went on below the belt in his fall collection: bloomers, narrowish in velvet by day; bloomers, puffed up into a taffeta bifurcated bubble by night; plus a few Bermudas with fluted frills at the knee thrown in as an alternative.</p><p>If only Mr. Armani would just reconcile himself to some regular trousers (those straight, two-legged, ankle-length things we all find so difficult to source, please), all could have worked out very satisfactorily in this show. Unarguably, there's something fine in the way Armani continues to develop his 30-year expertise in jackets. They were there in full force, looking fresh and supple in every variation from zigzag gray wool, to one-button velvet blazers to minimal military Spencers. These, and his fit-and-flare and swing coats, are clearly his core attraction. Quite why he persists in diverting attention from them is a conundrum.</p><p>Perhaps Armani is reluctant to revisit the place where he started. Certainly, his drive over the past decade has been to prove that he can be someone other than the genius who bestowed fantastically liberating softened men's suits upon eighties working women. But he won that argument years ago, by beating every other designer to the forefront of Hollywood red carpet dressing. The long mermaid dresses from his new couture collection have been siphoned off the ready-to-wear runway, in preparation for their imminent Oscar appearances. In their place, he ended this show with a series of short crystal-beaded evening looks (mercifully sans bloomers), but even they couldn't make up for the mystifying absence of a single viable pair of pants.</p></div>"
53,fall,2005,f2005,gucci,"On the surface of it, Gucci is behaving as if nothing has changed. The audience turns up at the darkened theater Tom Ford created to house his shows—same towering floral display in the foyer, same drinks reception, same deep-pile carpeted runway. Yet Ford departed a year ago, time and fashion have shifted, and just by showing in the sexed-up nineties venue her former master established, Alessandra Facchinetti is setting herself up for invidious comparisons with a lost era, before the audience even sits down.</p><p>She made a determined start with a military march on the soundtrack and a blue-black silhouette carved out of high Napoleonic collar jackets, balloon-sleeve taffeta blousons, plunging ruffle-neck shirts, and a reissue of the skin-tight pants that were a Ford perennial. The detail in those jackets, bands of velvet or black-on-black embroideries of roses, presented a vixenish version of the dark, Russian vibe currently running through Milan. From there, though, Facchinetti realized she had to move forward. ""I wanted a certain elegance and rigor, but I also wanted to find something more intimate,"" she explained. ""The hardness, we already know about at Gucci. I wanted something more intimate and poetic, so I looked at Victorian and Empire style.""</p><p>But what counts as intimate these days? Is it a high-collar dress with a big oval opening in the front to display the breasts? Is there poetry in an off-the-shoulder chiffon Marie Antoinette milkmaid neckline when combined with a torso tightly bandaged with lashings of jersey? It was in these moments that Facchinetti's difficulty in setting a new post-Ford agenda for Gucci showed. It came over better when she offered a less frantically worked red carpet Empire-line gown covered in a spider web of spangled tulle, but still, the specter of Ford's triumphal finales seemed to haunt this runway. Perhaps Facchinetti will eventually work her way toward the more gracefully feminine feeling she talked about, but that won't happen unless she stops carrying Gucci's recent history so heavily on her shoulders.</p></div>"
54,fall,2005,f2005,habitual,"Michael and Nicole Colovos picked a perfect day for their show. On the Sunday of New York Fashion Week, buyers and editors tend to dress down, and many in the audience were sporting versions of the looks on Habitual's runway. That's not to say the husband and wife team's collection hasn't grown since they moved in 2002 to Los Angeles in an expansionist mood. On the contrary, the duo have added leather to their repertoire, in the form of great ankle and knee-high boots and belts, not to mention second-skin pants and ruffle-front jackets that marry sexy with just the right touch of sweet.</p><p>But denim is the foundation of the line, and the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund runners-up cut it every which way but loose. There were skinny jeans and fuller styles, pegged skirts and flared ones. On top, single- and double-breasted jackets, some of which were piped in velvet, were cut close to the body and worn with hippie shirts layered over satin-trim tanks or turtlenecks in a muted palette of gray, dark brown, purple, and green. Some in the audience found the presentation repetitive, while others longed for some more styling flash. But most, there's little doubt, were making mental notes about their must-haves for fall.</p></div>"
55,fall,2005,f2005,hermes,"Watch out! The Bolsheviks are storming Hermès! Oh, sorry, forget that. It's only dear old Jean Paul Gaultier up to his pranks again, taking the season's Russian mania in a naughtily communist direction for fall. No need to be too afraid: The Marxist-Leninist content of his collection boiled down to a few revolutionary caps (in butter-soft suede) and Red Guard fur hats (earflaps flying); a single constructivist intarsia knit; and a lot of Russian-themed music on the sound system. As for the rest, it was so conservatively superluxurious and feminine, it turned out to be J.P.'s best outing for the house so far.</p><p>The main points of his manifesto were lots of shearling, tailored jackets in corduroy, and fit-and-flare skirts—a sort of ultra-upper-class parallel to what Christopher Bailey is up to at Burberry. Gaultier's sober pinstripe suits, classic gray flannel blazers, and even the reversible crocodile cinch-belted jackets, finally have that enviable softness that was formerly missing. Meanwhile, the designer found ways of running through the house's horsy heritage. Jackets cut from cashmere plaid blankets had fringe running down sleeves and around collars, and a crystal horse-bit brooch was pinned to a shearling hat. Even the famous Hermès silk print scarves were amplified for a fashion moment: sewn as the lining of a bronze metallic puffer or wittily smothering the outside of a Kelly bag.</p><p>Still, Gaultier's couture background means he can also be serious about cutting a mean evening dress. Hermès hardly has a reputation for after dark, but Gaultier's decadent, intensely purple velvet halter, and a long emerald velvet evening dress, ought to put the house on the party list this season. Though it's not quite the party comrade Lenin was thinking about.</p></div>"
56,fall,2005,f2005,imitation-of-christ,"Tara Subkoff's artsy, installation-style presentations make it easy to dismiss her as pretentious, but her Imitation of Christ show has become a Fashion Week must-see nonetheless. She has a sensitive pop culture radar; she attracts colorful, offbeat collaborators (this season, Park Avenue pop pranksters Mother Inc. performed in the Damien Hirst-decorated lobby of power dining spot Lever House); and according to industry insiders, she is maturing as a businesswoman, delivering her clothes on time and driving respectable sales.</p><p>That's not to say this was a great show—the usual mayhem prevailed, and Subkoff showed a torpor-inducing 70 looks. But there were some gems, several referencing the high points of American fashion history. The obi-tied minidresses bowed (to put it mildly) toward Rudi Gernreich; double-faced wool jackets recalled Bonnie Cashin; and there was a touch of Geoffrey Beene in the dolman-sleeved, bound-waist suits. Male models in drag called to mind Steven Meisel's gender-bending cover shoot for the October 2004 issue of <em>W</em> and picked up a theme that's bubbled up this season in shows as diverse as that of newcomer Jeremy Laing and Ruffian.</p><p>Less timely was Subkoff's revisiting of the Grecian theme she mined for spring. Her most successful update was a gray jersey dress with an attached drape on one side, but the rest seemed familiar, or worse: A riff of looks at the end featured seemingly stray pieces of fabric twisted and tucked into the waistbands of trousers and shorts. As always, what looks best on Subkoff herself looked best on the runway: every variety of minidress, from velvet with a Mandarin collar to hooded styles in jersey, silk, and suede.</p></div>"
57,fall,2005,f2005,j-mendel,"Broadtail has become the fur of the season, but leave it to Gilles Mendel, furrier to the young and fabulous, to whip it into an icy-white princess coat complete with tiny ruffles and bullion embroidery. A ranch mink jacket with sleeves pieced together from strips of cognac-colored leather was less precious, but no less a feat of tailoring.</p><p>Mendel's furs are always luxe—the hem of one coat, for example, was trimmed rather redundantly (and fabulously) with iridescent feathers—but his ready-to-wear shined for fall. Tweedy black-and-white jackets and bubble skirts were edged with silvery beading. For evening, he focused on draping, showing Empire-line dresses that cascaded to the runway in gazar or silk tulle. And he set his clients' hearts aflutter with lovely chiffon gowns, bloused below the knee and accessorized with Van Cleef &amp; Arpels diamond clips on velvet chokers. The rest of the audience (those of us whose calendars are not crammed with black-tie events) left the tents dreaming of his supercool sheared mink puffer coat with hammered-metal belt.</p></div>"
58,fall,2005,f2005,jasmin-shokrian,"For Los Angeles-based designer Jasmin Shokrian, her first show in New York was a happy, almost unreal experience that's been a long time in the planning. Like a lot of her young peers, she opted to show a small number of well-edited pieces. The first look, a black wool crepe dress, with <em>one</em> sculpted petal sleeve and a tucked, asymmetric hem showcased her training as a sculptor (at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago), while a silk crepe skirt with a balloony polka-dot front suggested her affinity for Japanese design à la CDG and Watanabe.</p><p>Shokrian worked her considerable draping and tailoring techniques on a variety of fabrics, often layering darkly colored and substantial wools and brocades over sheer, lightly colored chiffon tops, to varying degrees of success. A wool coat with detachable canvas layer seemed bulky, while her strict, cocoony capelets were chic. The highlight of the show was a black wool jersey dress, anchored by a leather belt—an eminently wearable evening look. (Its cousin, a more casually chic tunic-length version, was shown over pants.)</p><p>Shokrian's sculptural leanings can, at times, take her into overly abstract territory, but her more body-conscious designs should appeal to the adventurous urban consumer.</p></div>"
59,fall,2005,f2005,jean-paul-gaultier,"""Let's glam!"" said Jean Paul Gaultier backstage at his exuberant fall show. ""David Bowie, thank you! T. Rex, thank you!"" And to the glam-rock strains of that group's ""20th Century Boy"" and ""Children of the Revolution,"" Gaultier sent out his raucous parade. In fact, fun and flashy as those silver sequined leggings, second-skin brocade pants, and faux monkey-fur epaulets may have been, the peacock glitter eye shadow and Bowie quiffs were largely styling tricks—a diversion from the elegant core of a collection filled with classically chic clothes.</p><p>Gaultier's savvy tailoring played with influences as diverse as turn-of-the-century military uniforms and constructivist graphics, and he scissored the hems of his coats into diamond points—a line repeated on his reworked duffel, trench, and chic black ""tuxedo"" coat-dress, wittily tied with a gentleman's fringed white silk evening scarf.</p><p>There seems no end to the mischief Gaultier can wreak with his flawless trenchcoats, and this season he provided the loveliest yet—their revers had morphed into layered Pierrot collars, in black, cocoa, or mushroom faille. Prettiness continued to bloom at night, with enchanting chiffon or tulle evening dresses bound up in ribbons, or spangled with a cosmos of sequins—very Ziggy Stardust.</p></div>"
60,fall,2005,f2005,jeffrey-chow,"""Every season, I start with tons of DVDs,"" explained Jeffrey Chow backstage before his show. At the end of his cinematic inspiration hunt for fall, what remained were Visconti's <em>The Leopard</em> and Fassbinder's <em>The Marriage of Maria Braun</em>. Those classics translated into a quietly glamorous collection of embellished feminine pieces—a copper taffeta corset with tarnished sequins, say—juxtaposed with sturdy, more masculine ones, such as a deceptively plain black tunic that buttoned up the back.</p><p>The wide-leg pants, bow-front dresses, and fur chubbies of the forties have made appearances on many a runway this week, but where other designers veered into retro territory, Chow kept his day and evening looks from seeming overdone. Five-ply camel hair hand-knit sweaters, duchesse satin cocktail dresses veiled in tulle and point d'esprit, and must-have little black coats exuded sedate luxury. With the exception of a velvet suit with jet beading that leaned a bit too toreador, this burgeoning talent seems firmly in control of his rising star.</p></div>"
61,fall,2005,f2005,jil-sander,"There was an odd atmosphere hovering over the small gathering of people who were invited to view the last remnants of Jil Sander's work under her own name. The design team (who worked at her side in the nineties) finished the collection after she quit, so it was hard to look at the vaguely military-influenced collection without guessing where Sander left off and the anonymous backstage hands took over. Did she choose the dark melton cashmeres with their tab front fastenings, decide on the rounded shoulders and raised waists? Was she feeling for total looks of white or copper sequins before she left, or were those last two evening pieces filled in by the replacement committee?</p><p>It doesn't matter, of course. Intellectual analysis stops now that the Sander era is over, and for the time being at least, the house's output need only be scored on its commercial merits. Judged in that light, it met the criteria of wearability, adaptation to current trend, and a certain minimal sharpness. Eighteenth century militaria was applied to dolman-sleeve jackets and high-belted short coats (though whether Sander would have placed fabric imitation medals on the breast of a jacket was a hard question to beat back). The inevitable egg-shape skirt, weighted by a deep band of fabric in the hem, came out paired with a Sander staple: a drapey, semisheer V-neck sweater. For evening, embellishment and shine cropped up, in the form of Western fringing embedded in the flanks of a velvet dress, and the aforementioned sequins, decorating a white coat and a copper dress. In general, it looked fine. But whether the collection will find footing as a leader or a follower in the seasons to come is an issue that's left hanging.</p></div>"
62,fall,2005,f2005,jill-stuart,"The Jill Stuart show always draws a large contingent of Japanese press and buyers—apparently, according to one of the editors on hand today, thanks to the <em>kawaii</em> quality of the designer's aesthetic. Translation: the sweet, pretty values that encompass everything from the models (always innocent-looking) to Stuart's penchant for everything decorative.</p><p>Stuart worked a fresh, amethyst palette for fall, showcased most attractively in an ombré peasant-style skirt made of strips of variously hued lace. Also noteworthy were snug equestrian jackets and the first look, a velvet coat cinched tightly at the waist with a beautifully embroidered wide belt. Her use of pretty French fabrics, like a red and white toile and an eighteenth-century-style silk floral, tied in with the current craze for all things Marie Antoinette, though a slightly panniered purple toile dress went astray. As a whole, the collection was a grab bag: <em>Anna Karenina</em> (Cossack coat) meets <em>National Velvet</em>, with a dash of Lanvin (a sequined sage peasant blouse) and Madame Grès (the finale's goddess dresses) thrown in for good measure.</p></div>"
63,fall,2005,f2005,john-galliano,"The exquisitely lacquered Dita Von Teese, wearing John Galliano's twenties camisole slipdress of beaded nude satin, blithely declared that she had been carried across the snow to protect her swan's down mules so that she could take her place in the front row. She was the perfect almost real-life embodiment of the otherworldly silver-screen sirens whom the designer evoked in his fall show.</p><p>Martin Scorsese's <em>The Aviator</em>, with its playfully sophisticated costumes by Oscar-winning Sandy Powell, is fast proving the fashion world's inspirational movie of the season. This lavishly told tale of glamour, obsession, and megalomania was channeled by Galliano's Hollywood back-lot set—complete with arc lights, shadowy scene shifters, and canvas director's chairs (their backs stamped ""JOHN GALLIANO STUDIO"") drawn up to stars' well-lit makeup tables.</p><p>Galliano's collection reprised many of his own Oscar-worthy hits, and added some new obsessions—like the Warholian screen prints of over-made-up eyes that fluttered on the back of gleaming white blazers and cabans. With their finger-waved hair, bee-stung glossy black Clara Bow lips, and arched brows, the girls evoked a celebrated ad campaign shot by Javier Vallhonrat in the designer's wildly inventive late-eighties London days. And their clothes brought back further glory moments in his career. Slouchy blazers and wide-leg pants, complete with suede golfing shoes, suggested Dietrich's mannish off-duty wardrobe, now worn with a modern hip-hop attitude. Galliano rang the changes on his signature thirties-inspired bias-cut dresses via appliqués of drifts of butterflies or prints of overscale, Warhol-look carnations; his pretty twenties debutante dresses, meanwhile, were updated with powder-pink marabou or Wiener Werkstätte-inspired trim. Even more playfully self-referential was a giant parka in chinoiserie-embroidered poison-green satin—an obvious allusion to Nicole Kidman's defining 1997 Dior Academy Awards dress, its hood edged in the pale mink that trimmed the hem of that gown.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""yp752k""></div></div><p>This greatest-hits collection, while not leading us into a brave new fashion world, at least confirmed the myriad reasons that make Galliano great—not least the preternatural sense of self that saw him take his bow amid a lavishly choreographed explosion of flaming tapers and the whoosh of a wind machine. <em>Vive le roi!</em></p></div>"
64,fall,2005,f2005,jonathan-saunders,"When he first appeared on the London scene, Jonathan Saunders blew audiences away with the way he manipulated zinging color and vivid print onto lovely, flowy dresses. It was those fresh, kaleidoscopic chiffons that generated the buzz around him, but Saunders seems to have a baffling lack of understanding of his own attractions. Last winter, he replaced his clear greens, blues, and yellows with mustard, rust, and black, lost the delightful chiffon in favor of robotic body-clinging wool, and was criticized for it. Perversely, he committed the same mistake again this winter, with more covered-up 1980's silhouettes and a palette of black, gray, navy, red, and ochre that failed to pop.</p><p>Saunders' technical skill and talent for original surface pattern isn't in dispute. Though he dutifully explained the origins of his winter prints in his program notes (Inuit, Japanese, and African), the painterly brush strokes, zigzag weaves, and ""scarification"" effects didn't turn out remotely ""ethnic,"" and that's a plus. The problem comes when a designer is so absorbed in producing sophisticated artistic fabrics that he fails to stand back and look at how a collection coheres, or ask how it relates to fashion. Some of his evening pieces, particularly a gray turtleneck dress with a swirling speckled print on its long flowing skirt, and a gown with a cut-out back and a full red skirt, achieved a vaguely Geoffrey Beene-like elegance, but they weren't enough to lift the show. Handling both shape and fabric is a tall order for a young independent like Saunders. One solution might be to hook up with another designer who can help with silhouettes, but another is right under his nose: Remember what you did in the beginning, Jonathan, and work on that.</p></div>"
65,fall,2005,f2005,junya-watanabe,"The communal delight that welled up at Junya Watanabe's show was a bit like the surge of elation that comes when the pieces of an impossible puzzle click together. How to make the heritage of haute couture relevant today? Where does Victoriana fit into that picture? And where have all the casual clothes gone? These questions have been swirling around Paris fashion like the sleet in the streets. And suddenly, they all settled into a moment of charming clarity under Watanabe's roof.</p><p>Girls in tufted, rough-hewn Davy Crockett hats began walking out wearing full-skirt fifties dresses in mohair plaid—part prom, part rock 'n' roll. One had a black vinyl bodice, introducing the masterfully simple melding of old-world fabric and high-tech utility Watanabe calls ""heavy-duty couture."" The idea came together in a series of blousons and parkas in which an outer layer of tweed was fused onto a shiny synthetic inner shell. An absolutely practical padded checked brown tweed jacket, its generous collar lined in orange nylon, bubbled into a voluminous parallel of Cristobal Balenciaga's tailoring.</p><p>Other pieces, bunched up below the waist with parachute ripcords to give a vague sense of the eighteenth century, moved toward the modernist romance that marks Watanabe's most inspired shows. Black high-neck, pie-frilled Victorian blouses and ruffle-sleeve jackets, worn with circle skirts (one padded like a nylon duvet), connected brilliantly with the sober, governessy silhouette that is cropping up as a new direction this week. Watanabe conflates all these complex influences into clothes that look current and simple to wear—and that's a stroke of genius.</p></div>"
66,fall,2005,f2005,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole invariably screens some preshow movie that's part social commentary, part industry spoof, and which draws on both Cole's admirable commitment to charity and his ability to come up with questionable puns. This time round, the designer's guest star was comedian-actor Mario Cantone. And at the risk of ending up as a bitchy throwaway line in Cantone's next one-man show, he would have been better off toning down the acerbic wit and sticking to Cole's message about providing for the homeless.</p><p>But what was the message when it came to dressing for fall 2005? Cole has always had an ability to accurately sense which way the wind is blowing and to translate that into affordable offerings that are relatively easy on the eye. This season, that meant shrunken jackets, lean bombers, and tulip-shaped skirts. Yet there were hints that Cole might also have more-sophisticated ambitions for his womenswear. This was especially evident in the accessories—in particular, a pale, bleached gray crocodile studded hobo bag—and with the evening dresses that closed the show. An homage to Halston (not to mention Calvin Klein), they were minimal Empire-line gowns rendered in billowing wool jersey and in shades of petrol blue, cranberry, and dark brown, the collection's main color palette. Not a bad place to start if you're looking to replenish your fall wardrobe.</p></div>"
67,fall,2005,f2005,kenzo,"What do you get when you enlist a Sardinia-based multitasker to design a Japanese label owned by a French conglomerate? A multi-culti 72-look extravaganza, complete with a patchwork of rich tapestries for a backdrop and an extra-wide runway lined with lush greenery. For his third outing for LVMH-owned Kenzo, Antonio Marras (who presents his own collection in Milan and is also the creative director of Trend les Copains) sent out a grand tour's worth of embroideries, florals, lamés, tartans, velvets, and crochets.</p><p>It was a rich panoply, held together rather loosely with grand volumes, acid-bright colors, and thin hippie-esque headbands stretched across the models' foreheads. Perhaps too rich—some excellent pieces, like tweedy riding jackets, needlepoint-embellished djellaba tunics (paired sillily with plaid pants), and tulip-sleeve turtleneck sweaters, among others, got lost in the fray. But there was no missing Marisa Berenson, who closed the show wearing a floor-length floral dress and a fur-trimmed cape with flats in true nouveau boho fashion.</p></div>"
68,fall,2005,f2005,lagerfeld-gallery,"Karl Lagerfeld's dynamic soundtrack mixed Prince with Scissor Sisters in a metaphor for his collection's playful juxtaposition of proportions—from the eighties, there were broad-shouldered swing coats, short or long but always with a great deal of swagger, and from today, superskinny pantsuits that define a new silhouette.</p><p>Tommy Hilfiger Inc. bought the Lagerfeld Gallery label at the end of last year, and that development seemed to signal a heightened sense of luxury at the house—from the extraordinary LED backdrop that spelled the designer's name (and also reappeared on low-slung belts that anchored the designer's second-skin pants) to the collection's embarrassment of furs and fur trims. Lush fox stoles wrapped asymmetrically around the body with jersey ties, while narrow turtleneck sweaters had detachable funnel collar and bib combinations to help deflect the sort of glacial weather that Paris experienced the morning of the show.</p><p>For day, Lagerfeld wrapped his heroine dresses with habitual geometric rigor—and added a great deal of swingy volume to coats to balance the lean looks beneath. But for all that clean-cut severity, his after-dark clothes were a riot of prettiness. Standouts included slipper satin and jersey gowns with twisted apron halters and soft evening dresses with a thirties flavor in dusty boudoir pinks and teals, belted with garlands of chiffon roses like those once used by Madeleine Vionnet.</p></div>"
69,fall,2005,f2005,lanvin,"Following a golden blockbuster of a season is a tough challenge for any designer to face. Being sandwiched between two other major shows on the same day—the tense Olympic sprint to the end of an outstanding Paris season—put Alber Elbaz in an even more competitive spot for fall. So where did he place? Well, considerably handicapped by the lack of top models (most were prebooked by Louis Vuitton and YSL), and showing in spartan conditions, Lanvin took the silver.</p><p>He did extraordinary coats, starting with an orange textured velvet in his familiar full-skirt look, and introduced new shapes in stricter black, including a knife-narrow version of his now classic taffeta raincoat. A sexily shaped jacket that appeared as part of black pencil skirt suit, and then in a gorgeous white panne velvet, will inspire women on the hunt for fall chic. As for Elbaz's best-selling dresses, there were plenty, ranging from a newly sober high-neck, long-sleeve black velvet number to more familiarly dainty styles in layered chiffons and plissé tulle, as well as high-waist ballerina dresses.</p><p>Each of those pieces explains why Elbaz belongs to a superelite of fashion frontrunners who are leaving most other collections in the distance. But this was a presentation that, while giving an airing of all the things women love about Lanvin, somehow didn't quite clinch the drama of a top-rated show. The demerits were some oddly judged styling devices (pale ballet slippers that made some girls look as if they were barefoot), a lack of focus in the editing, and some apparently random surprises: two boldly colorful flowered dresses with mismatched floral coats. Perhaps they were indications of the way this extraordinary designer will take fashion next, and in that way, they have intriguing potential. But, like the rest of the show, they didn't quite move the label forward enough to make this season one of Elbaz's truly memorable spectaculars.</p></div>"
70,fall,2005,f2005,lela-rose,"""If I ever do hard edges, it means I'm on drugs,"" Lela Rose joked before her fall show. And true to her word, the Texan designer sent out 28 of the pretty looks for which she's known: full skirts paired with trim jackets, cocktail dresses topped with lace, and strapless gowns with jeweled necklines that would have sparkled on her clients the Bush twins at their countless inaugural balls.</p><p>For day, Rose showed a gray turtleneck with a pink gathered-waist skirt, and a ruffle shirt with pageboy pants, but even those came with a sprinkling of sequins. Evening is where she shines, because that's what her audience demands. A mix of jewel tones (citrine, loden, and bright violet) and textures (metallic herringbones and embroidered Jacquards) pleased all present, including Celerie Kemble's much photographed Jack Russell terrier, Anchovie.</p></div>"
71,fall,2005,f2005,louis-vuitton,"After a signature collection that started the New York season in controversy, Marc Jacobs came back to close the Paris shows with a triumph. He took Louis Vuitton into the dark, sober territory he had sketched out in his own collection, but this time, there was nothing morose or clunky about it. Instead, it served as a concise, uplifting exploration of Parisian chic, wiping away the anxious question marks that have hovered over black, voluminous shapes, and around discussions of retro vs. modernism and restraint vs. opulence.</p><p>Making it look simple is the trick, and Jacobs did that right away by sending out an impeccable black Shetland suit with an elongated calf-length pencil skirt, the jacket's elegant balloon sleeves re-emphasizing the tininess of the waist. Next up: a cashmere double-breasted coat, swinging loose from the body, with sloped fifties shoulders and three-quarter-length sleeves, finished off with a wide-brim purple fedora. From then on, the audience was won over by the reworkings of bubble-backed, shawl-collared Balenciaga-era coats and spellbound by the intensely detailed decoration that began to appear: mink embroidery on a cape; herringbone tweed covered in a veiling of tulle; lizard patchworked on dresses and skirts. After Vuitton's circus of spangles and multicolored prints last season, it represented one of those defining moments when a designer puts his finger on what needs to change, and how to do it.</p><p>Afterward, amid the media scrum, Uma Thurman nailed the show's attraction. ""It's luscious and structured, with regal sophistication and sexiness,"" she declared. ""Splendid, whimsical things!"" commented Selma Blair from the other side of the room. Jacobs, meanwhile, was busy explaining that the influences, researched by his team, had sprung from a trip to Vienna, where they'd immersed themselves in the Wiener Werkst¿tte turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts movement to find a stricter, darker source of structure and texture.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zn6ya""></div></div><p>Meanwhile, the other stars of the Vuitton show—the bags—were receiving their very own deluge of attention. The amazing confections of mink, python, embossed quilting, tulle, jet crystal beading, leather passementerie, gold bookbinder printing, Art Deco chains, and cabochons of semiprecious stones were lined up as if on an altar, where Japanese TV cameras were jostling for close-ups. Of course, this is the whole point of Louis Vuitton. One can only wish that the outstanding clothes of this collection will (finally) be as available in stores as the bags.</p></div>"
72,fall,2005,f2005,luca-luca,"The days of the glamazon are gone, and the clingy, slit-to-there dresses that Luca Orlandi once served up with relish are now relegated to the back of the closet. Last spring, the designer made a sensitive—and sensible—shift in mood, trading sexy for sweet, and he continued in that vein for fall. Raunch was confined to the soundtrack (and to the front-row presence of Paris and Nicky Hilton), while on the runway, the designer explored variations of skirt-and-sweater dressing.</p><p>Orlandi sent out well-tailored coats, in beautiful cashmeres and wools, some printed, some colored red or army green. Paired with flat shoes and boots, these showed the designer hitting his stride. Elsewhere, however, his proportions seemed skewed: Wool gauchos were too generously flared, while dresses that were trim on top, ballooned enormously below, for an overall effect that was off-kilter. Orlandi is certainly moving in the right direction, but he's not quite there yet.</p></div>"
73,fall,2005,f2005,luella,"Luella Bartley hired Danish duo the Raveonettes to play during her fall show at the National Arts Club. But their catchy cover of Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" only served to remind the English designer's many fans that this collection felt like a rehashing of vintage-inspired trends that have become familiar over the past couple of seasons: the nerdy chic of bow-front blouses, the trench, and the only slightly less ubiquitous poncho. Bartley also reinterpreted Gucci's famous horse-bit-logo print with double Ls.</p><p>What looked fresh, on the other hand, were circle-skirted fifties-style prom dresses in bright silk faille, and a couple of black-and-white paillette dresses that looked like something Andy Warhol It girl Edie Sedgwick (in the air this season thanks to an exhibit at Gallagher's and an upcoming biopic starring Sienna Miller) might have worn. Bartley also upped the luxe quotient with ostrich bombers and slim skirts. And, of course, there were her collectible bags. This season, in keeping with her mostly seventies theme, she sent out plenty of studded, grommeted, and fringed styles that are sure to fly off the shelves.</p></div>"
74,fall,2005,f2005,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Marc by Marc Jacobs is the go-to brand for hip young women looking for must-have pieces. Wearing the label from head to toe, though, is a tricky proposition: When the designer hits upon an era or theme, he goes all out, and his kind of layer-it-on dressing isn't simple to pull off. Nor is it easy to take in at one of his shows. You're still registering the satin jacket layered on top of a nautical sweater, rib turtleneck, and belted baggy jeans when a striped dress saunters by accessorized with a pompom necklace, strappy suede boots, and knee-highs.</p><p>Jacobs made matters smoother today by revisiting the mid-eighties reference points he worked for spring—baggy jeans and bubble skirts, fluorescent parkas and taffeta prom dresses. In his mix were bright colors, oversize prints, and buffalo plaids, played against each other or paired with faded denim and wide wale corduroy. As usual, each look was accessorized to the max, with engineer caps, extra-wide belts, ""MARC"" barrettes, and black tights riddled with holes and runs. No doubt, even the last will be hot commodities at his always busy boutiques.</p></div>"
75,fall,2005,f2005,marc-jacobs,"Backstage after his show, in between greeting such well-wishers as Rachel Feinstein and Debbie Harry, Marc Jacobs rattled off quite a list of talking points, from T.J. Wilcox's <em>Garlands</em> installation at Metro Pictures to Violet, the sullen superhero teenager of <em>The Incredibles</em>, to Edward Gorey. Toss in some ""fashion editors in their minimalist black periods and Romeo Gigli shoes,"" and you have an approximation of his wide-ranging fall collection. It was quite a ride—made all the more surreal by a one-and-a-half-hour delay—and a much darker one than last season.</p><p>The show started off on a somber note with nubby black jackets and midcalf-length navy skirts that floated mysteriously around the models' legs, as if they'd been pumped up with air. Volume, and experimenting with it, became a recurring motif. Trapeze coats swung from shoulders; floral-print dresses ballooned behind Vlada and Lily as they tromped down the runway; and one moiré dress tented out beneath a chevron-striped mink coat. Another theme was embellishment. Rosettes adorned everything from the bust of a strapless velvet dress to a tweed muffler; tattered collars decorated jackets; and cardigans and knit caps were veiled with lace. But despite the parade of party dresses, some in black point d'esprit and others with flashes of colorful silk, it wasn't all girly, all the time. There's room in Jacobs' story for a tomboy or two, and they were dressed the part in rugby-striped sweaters that brought his grunge collection to mind.</p><p>Overall, however, these were clothes for girls who lead fairy tale lives, and quite a few of them—Uma Thurman, Drew Barrymore, Lisa Marie, and Lil' Kim included—were on hand to enjoy the spectacle.</p></div>"
76,fall,2005,f2005,marni,"Just when we thought we had the Marni girl down as a sunny second-generation flower child, a hoarder of pretty bright prints and bonkers haberdashery accessories, she turns sober on us. For fall, she seems to have entered a fugue mood, which, in a way, is understandable, considering the general drift toward grayness in the fashion weather this season. On the other hand, black, brown, navy, shades of beige, and (yes) gray aren't naturally the colors that suit her playful character, and that cast a cloud over this collection.</p><p>Marni's deliberately imprecise cut, curvilinear volumes, gathered egg-shaped skirts, and three-quarter-length sleeves, as well as the homemade fifties dressmaker quality of the clothes haven't changed. That will be enough to please the ever-increasing band of international followers who've hooked up to the ragtag <em>nouvelle vague</em> Marni caravan. But designer Consuelo Castiglioni hasn't altered her simply belted, regular-looking fur coats either, and that's more problematic. Marni started off as a pioneering revivalist in that category, but a sense of creative standstill added to the impression that the collection as a whole is marking time. Even the solid, sensible slingback platforms and leather bags, now shorn of their dangly doodads, added to the general sense of downbeat calm. It was perfectly fine, but when next spring comes, the girl needs to start moving cheerfully on.</p></div>"
77,fall,2005,f2005,martin-grant,"""I don't work with themes,"" explained Martin Grant after his lovely intimate presentation in a grand, old Paris apartment. And thank goodness. For fall, this private dressmaker turned ready-to-wear designer delivered another round of simple, subtly elegant clothes that marked what he called an ""evolution of the previous season."" Once again, Grant focused on tailoring. He did smart felted pea coats and jackets in camel, cadet blue, and black, but they were often worn with liquid silk jersey skirts or pants (the former full and flirty, the latter straight-leg and slim), which softened the effect. Similarly, he paired a black bouclé wool jacket with tulip sleeves with a tiered peasant skirt. This sort of architectural, yet easy look is one of Grant's great strengths.</p><p>The other, of course, is his dresses, which came in panne velvet, tulle netting, and that liquid silk jersey. Grant is a master of the knee-length cocktail frock, the perfect LBD (this season with bracelet-length sleeves, a Peter Pan collar, and a full pleated skirt) that his clients turn to again and again. He doesn't normally traffic in show-stoppers, but there was one floor-grazing halter-neck gown, in iridescent lavender, that more than fit that description.</p></div>"
78,fall,2005,f2005,matthew-williamson,"The Grand Lodge Hall was an apt location for Matthew Williamson's fall show. The space, after all, is the New York Freemason's club house, and the designer's collection had more masculine touches than ever before. To begin with, cashmere turtlenecks came with ""epaulets"" encrusted with crystals; later, military jackets were cut in gray flannel or Lurex Jacquard. And while pants have never been his strong suit, this season he cut mean tailored trousers that were tucked into knee-high boots or worn long and full over peep-toe sandals.</p><p>But Williamson hasn't completely abandoned his flair for the feminine—he'd never disappoint front-row fans Sophie Dahl and Padma Lakshmi like that. So there was plenty of beading on Empire-line minidresses and flowing butterfly hem gowns (two of his favorite silhouettes); lace trim on silk camisoles and long-sleeve blouses; and elaborate embroidery on a capelike jacket. One patchwork group showcased his strong color sense, and there were some button-front tops that would work well at the office without being workmanlike—perfect timing, considering this Englishman is on the hunt for real estate for a New York store.</p></div>"
79,fall,2005,f2005,max-mara,"There are some shows that make you question the meaning of, well, shows. MaxMara is a case in point. The company is one of the world's most consistently reliable sources of coats, synonymous with uncontroversial words like ""classic"" and ""good taste."" In a good way. And the program notes for the label's fall collection made reassuring mention of ""sartorial rigour, quality and coherence.""</p><p>Then came the show itself. There were coats all right, but submerged in ""fashion styling"" so egregious—hooded bodysuits, bubble skirts, white tights, and (help!) white leather fringe—as to leave the audience in a state of disbelief.</p><p>Ironically, a brisk march through the smart belted overcoats and Prince of Wales check pantsuits would have been a far bolder departure, and a sign of a brand that thinks in a modern way. The looser shape of the coats, the volume of shearling blousons, and sharp details like patent linings in the back of jacket collars could have made a condensed statement in a quarter of the time. But instead, the potential for ""rigor and coherence"" was dissolved in a perplexing rehash of parts of the eighties no grown woman wishes to relive. A nod toward ""volume"" with a single egg-shape skirt? Fine. But to commit to that as a ""theme,"" done in dogtooth patterns, up to and including ballooning taffeta and an occasional explosion of flamenco ruffles? Incredible. In a bad way.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ele3k""></div></div><p>MaxMara is far from the only Italian manufacturer to fall into this old-think ""designer collection"" way of dressing up a core product as glamorous news. The trouble is that runway showiness is predicated on a template that was set in the eighties—and which now looks as out of date as those fringed ankle boots.</p></div>"
80,fall,2005,f2005,menichetti,"For fall, Roberto Menichetti put his version of modernism to the test on the Milan runway. He applied himself to the task by showcasing the best high-tech fabric that Italian industrial expertise can produce: interesting, barely describable materials with crinkled, washed, iridescent surfaces, and the most malleable of leathers. The designer used these to best effect when he kept things simple, tailoring shapely jackets or a plain navy double-faced cashmere topcoat over wide slouchy pants. Those pieces, along with a few nicely judged cashmere Aran knits, successfully addressed the yawning gap that has opened in the market for updated sportswear.</p><p>The collection, however, lost coherence when Menichetti got conceptual, delving into overcomplicated paneled wrap skirts and lumpy chiffon and linen dresses. He'd do well to concentrate on answering the need for beautiful basics, rather than extending himself into the further reaches of avant-garde experimentalism.</p></div>"
81,fall,2005,f2005,michael-kors-collection,"After last spring's dip in the Mediterranean, Michael Kors sought fall inspiration in his New York stomping grounds—Madison Avenue in particular, where a Saturday afternoon stroll calls for a turtleneck, khakis, and a mammoth raccoon coat.</p><p>As Gwen Stefani sang about a ""million-dollar contract,"" Kors' models streamed down the runway in suitably luxe silks, suedes, and cashmeres, and fur aplenty. The designer favored streamlined, sport-influenced silhouettes, from second-skin stretch-crepe bodices on dresses to ski pants in nylon or faille. Graphic blacks and whites were accentuated with shots of bright red, blue, and purple, and camel was teamed with icy gray. Kors' cosmopolitan outfits were topped off with knit caps and goggle-like sunglasses—but if his city girls have a real hankering for the slopes, they can slip into a snowflake tube top or a simple dress accented with racing stripes.</p><p>In addition to all those polished sportif looks, Kors included enough evening options to clothe customers with a party to attend every night. Cocktail numbers were studded with crystals and trimmed with feathers that shimmied as the models strode by—he didn't call them ""dance dresses"" for nothing—while his gowns in monochrome brights were made for the spotlight.</p></div>"
82,fall,2005,f2005,missoni,"Position in the family accounts for much of the way we perform in life, as we all know. So consider Angela Missoni's lot. She's a fortysomething mom, shouldering the load of her parents' remarkable seventies achievements, while also tuning in to the style signals coming from her live-wire teenage children. Perhaps that's why her fall collection looked like a kind of compromise solution thrashed out at a Missoni family policy summit. In other words, keep alive the zigzag flame knits, space dyed patterns and florals, take on board the youngsters' fascination with the eighties, but don't forget to address the working woman's need for some forgiving knits for the daily grind, either.</p><p>Angela Missoni picked her way into the general anti-flash mood of the season by choosing a subtle palette of slate, beige, misty blue, and plaster pink, sparked up with brighter shades of turquoise and purple. She contrasted passionflower prints on tube skirts and tight sexy camisoles against thick loose cashmere cardigans and V-neck sweaters, and slung on parkas to make things a little more casual. The eighties element came in tightly draped printed chiffon bodices and puffy taffeta collars of the kind Emanuel Ungaro might've designed for Alexis Colby. Styled together with striped obi knit belts and high heels strapped to the foot with silk strands, the collection never quite gelled as a total look. But then again, in a store, the bits and pieces will undoubtedly offer something for everyone in the family.</p></div>"
83,fall,2005,f2005,miu-miu,"With her slightly ratted bouffant pony tail, net head scarf, and existentially hip early-sixties clothes, the Miu Miu girl has turned beatnik—sort of—for fall. She showed up, first of all, in a camel checked cape, white shirt, neat black A-line skirt, and chunky patent platform sandals—plain, neat, and intelligent.</p><p>She's also instantly recognizable: a stock character who wanders the Prada universe picking up vintage pieces to put together in her dowdy/clever way. She has a collection of Mongolian-lamb wraps and coats with big shaggy collars, as well as paisley-printed skirts, dresses, and coats from that early, mumsy, psychedelic period. She also has a taste for drab knits and dubious suede patchwork in mustard and purple. And her tendency to spike things up with a black leather and chrome chain belt, or a studded bag, indicates a slight propensity for rocker-girl moodiness.</p><p>This collection served to reiterate Miuccia Prada's love of what she's often called ""banal"" clothes. The familiarity of it all didn't push fashion in any new direction; many of these clothes are out there already, in vintage stores and, not least, Miu Miu shops. But in a dull cycle of Milan shows, it stood out pretty well.</p></div>"
84,fall,2005,f2005,monique-lhuillier,"Inspired by a book about the jewels of an Indian maharaja, Monique Lhuillier delivered an absolute gem of a collection for fall. She took a subtle approach to her theme, via a palette of persimmon, olive, and curry, one paisley print, and hand embellishments, some including semiprecious stones.</p><p>Lhuillier is an increasingly popular pick for red carpet events, so the beauty of her eveningwear—particularly a print gown with jeweled harness, a leopard-print chiffon, and a full-skirt strapless green gazar—came as no surprise. But the consistent excellence of the daywear was newsworthy. The opening look, a metallic polo skirt dress accessorized with chestnut-size beads, set the tone of modern elegance. A black Chantilly lace blouse with puff sleeves paired with a ruffle day dress made for a perfect update to the LBD, just as a light four-pocket lace jacket and pencil skirt imbued the suit with subtle sexiness. And you couldn't possibly go wrong with the designer's fox collar tweed overcoat or, for that matter, her plum metallic tweed trenchcoat. Almost all the looks were cinched at the waist with a pretty black bow—the perfect finish to this gift of a show.</p></div>"
85,fall,2005,f2005,moschino,"When a model with a flyaway quiff and cat's-eye makeup steps onto the runway dressed in a black leather flared baby-doll bolero on top of a sparkly chiffon dress with a kick frill at the hem, what is one supposed to make of it? The late Franco Moschino was known for his sense of humor, but that couldn't explain what was behind one of the oddest conglomerates of clothing to hit the Milan runway for many a season.</p><p>As the bizarre mixture of fetishy frilled leather skirts and kinky pinafores, mixed with puff-sleeve blouses and folksy felted coats with leaf appliqués proceeded, the mystery only deepened. A few tenuous connections to the inevitable Milan bubble skirt appeared along the way, but they weren't much help in anchoring this deranged show to anything current.</p></div>"
86,fall,2005,f2005,narciso-rodriguez,"Paris Hilton, who sauntered into Narciso Rodriguez's show with Tinkerbell cradled in her arms, seems like an unlikely fan. She's way too flash for this designer's understated, architectural chic. But perhaps she gleaned something from Rodriguez's scuba-tight seamed constructions, something his many boldface followers already know: Covering up can be sexy. The proof is in his fabulous coats, from a pale-red double-face wool to a corseted herringbone style slashed almost fetishistically above the breasts to reveal the clothes or bare skin beneath.</p><p>This wasn't one of Rodriguez's quieter shows. There was plenty of black and white, of course, but he continued to experiment with vivid color, showing even ankle boots and—in a departure from his signature stilettos—stacked-heel pumps in fuchsia suede. They added a jolt to even his strictest suit, which this season came in three pieces: a man's jacket, a slim skirt, and a fitted tank in place of the more traditional vest. In addition to tanks, bra tops and harnesses did double duty under cocktail dresses or, for aesthetic rather than structural effect, over coats. Another reinvention was the cut-above-the-bust bolero that Rodriguez showed in a cashmere blend, in microsequins, and finally in wool fleece over one of his wonderful, weightless gowns.</p></div>"
87,fall,2005,f2005,nina-donis,"Just when American and Western European designers are turning to Russia for inspiration, who should come in from the cold but a couple of designers from Moscow? Ironically, the Nina Donis pair represents the polar opposite of the babushka and Anna Karenina fantasies of fashion folk. They arrived on the London runway armed with an invigoratingly chic-looking blast of realism that, within a few exits, had the audience sitting at attention. No crushed-velvet dirndls or fur-lined brocades here: Instead these two have taken a look at the streets of modern Moscow and come up with a creative fusion of garments that address the twenty-first century in an imaginatively practical way.http://www.fridakahlo.com/bio.shtml ""I go out on the streets of Moscow and look at how people dress to keep out the cold, layering on all the clothes they have. The less they try to look good, the more interesting they look,"" said Donis Pouppis, who designs with his partner, Nina Neretina. That explains the thought process behind the surprisingly elegant forms the pair created, say, a raincoat made into a dress, with a fringed scarf embedded in the side, or a puffer coat, with a silky raincoat creating a drapey volume on the back. These kinds of transpositions have been the stock in trade of Martin Margiela and Jean Paul Gaultier for years. But there's something new-generation about the way the Nina Donis duo upgrades the shapes of urban streetwear, like tracksuits and down jackets, with traditional tailoring fabrics, and turns it all to the very Russian point of making a young woman look good. With great items like narrow skirts in menswear fabrics and smart gray tailored denim, this was an accomplished collection from a rare pair of designers who are transmitting a jolt of excitement about contemporary dressing.</p></div>"
88,fall,2005,f2005,nina-ricci,"Chez Nina Ricci, Lars Nilsson was interested in melding the soft with the hard. He leavened the fragile dresses that he loves, light and airy as 1930's lingerie, with sturdy elements to protect them from the cold: a blond fur jacket with ballooning Renaissance sleeves caught with marmalade ribbons; lean, long-line tweedy coats; and sporty swing-back jackets. Nilsson seemed more comfortable, though, with soft pieces (""flou,"" in couture workroom parlance). Standouts included fragile blouses traced with insets of lace, pretty evening gowns, including one in blush-pink chiffon frosted with crystal, and a gray chiffon djellaba casting a shadow over the tree-of-life print on the under-dress beneath. These were so effortlessly constructed they seemed as though they had been blown by some zephyr onto the body.</p><p>But there was hardness even in the lingerie elements, courtesy of Nilsson's collaborator Mr. Pearl, the corset king. This season, the elaborate lingerie pieces he develops for the house included a spectacular wasp-waist, silvery satin strapless evening dress, with the seams and boning of a nineteenth century corset. (Not all Pearl's pieces are this demanding on the wearer; as those chiffon lingerie frocks spilled from shoulders, or a lacy mohair knit sweater plunged daringly low, the flash of a perfectly constructed satin brassiere revealed the subtler aspects of his work.)</p><p>For Nilsson, trees are as beautiful as the flowers that are emblematic of this house, and he delighted in prints that celebrated them—from that tree of life to a shadowy autumnal fall of leaves. These elements gently evoked the work of twenties Swedish artist and architect Josef Frank (whose textile prints are enjoying a renaissance) and revealed the designer's fondness for the folkloric aspect of his native country. They also tapped beautifully into the turn-of-the-century, fairy-tale spirit that is one of fall's more poetic trends.</p></div>"
89,fall,2005,f2005,oscar-de-la-renta,"Oscar de la Renta's shows are always elegant and invariably luxe. But for fall, the designer really went to town with the signature embellishments loved so well by his mother-daughter fans (like Tina and Beyoncé Knowles, who made their way to their seats after the lights had dimmed). The collection started on an ethnic note, with belted ikat coats and jackets (a motif he introduced for spring) worn with bejeweled turtlenecks and glen plaid skirts or trousers, also embroidered. No look was left undone, except perhaps for a few pairs of shorts that shouldn't have made it to the runway; they're a tough sell for this genteel crowd. Ornamentation came via trompe l'oeil beading on cashmere crewnecks, coin appliqués on skirts and handbags, even unexpected crocheted brooches on knit scarves.</p><p>Evening was just as ornate. De la Renta reprised one of his greatest hits when he paired voluminous white silk blouses with brightly hued embroidered velvet gypsy skirts. One black cocktail dress was simple enough for Holly Golightly, but most were decorated—some opulently with rhinestones and tiny silk bows or gold paillettes. His red carpet numbers ranged from streamlined racer-back columns with heavy dustings of sequins to Empire-line tulle princess gowns to brocade showstoppers that grazed the toes of audience members as they glided by—just the thing for a larger-than-life diva like Knowles.</p></div>"
90,fall,2005,f2005,paul-smith,"The great thing about Paul Smith is that he's incapable of growing up—even though he's Britain's most successful senior designer and fully furnished with a knighthood, to boot. His perennially youthful eye gives his best collections a tomboyish naturalness that manages to capture the essence of the arty English student way of dressing. No need for Sir Paul to trawl reverently through reference books for sixties inspiration. Like the Beatles, he was there, and now that there's a new generation in love with vintage, he's absolutely at home in the English time zone of mod meets hippie.</p><p>""What really set me off was the 18-year-old daughters of friends who are coming in on work placement … and thinking of all the great things they'd love to wear from their fiftysomething mother's wardrobes,"" said the designer. So out came the little Empire-line dresses, the mini capes, the narrow boy-tailored plaid pants, the drainpipe jeans, and the stripy knit college scarves. Styled with great-looking low-heel, square-toe Mary Janes and woolly colored tights, the collection was a breezy run-through of Paul Smith's signature items, from tailored trousers to cheerful argyle knits, polished off with a couple of panne velvet flower-embroidered caftan dresses that any 18-year-old would kill for.</p></div>"
91,fall,2005,f2005,peter-jensen,"The light-hearted Peter Jensen experience has become a moment to cherish in London. As a Dane, he brings something young and playfully Nordic to his runway, like girls in knitted bonnets, shrunken snowflake sweaters, and delightfully silly hats with outsize pompoms bobbling on top. Plain and Scandinavian, Jensen's clothes never seem to be overly styled, but the proportions of his high-waisted checked coats, full skirts, balloon-sleeve blouses, artist smocks, and teeny school blazers, capture the gist of things without seeming to try.</p><p>Still, for all the delightfulness of Jensen's detail (like the naive cross-stitching on the yoke of a dress), it's his accessories that put the really big smiles on the faces of his audience. This season, Jensen has collaborated with a Japanese artist, Susumu Fujimoto, to design cute wooden handbags, one painted with a woodland deer scene and the other a cutout in the shape of a giant snowflake. They have a girlish <em>kawaii</em> factor that should make Jensen big in Japan, though perhaps not quite on the scale of Marc Jacobs after his collaboration with Takashi Murakami for Louis Vuitton.</p></div>"
92,fall,2005,f2005,peter-som,"If Peter Som had his way, none of his clients would have to work. For his fall collection, the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist used the notion of Anjelica Huston picnicking at Hanging Rock, and while it produced sweet dresses and coats, there weren't many office-appropriate looks—not unless you can pull off a sheer black lace Victoriana top with your tweed skirt. Instead, he sent out a boyish tuxedo suit with cropped pants, party frocks in point d'esprit (the after-dark material of the moment), and gowns in what he described as Vermeer-hued velvets: puce, chartreuse, and peacock.</p><p>In a season of expansive volumes, Som's full skirts, including one or two prairie styles, flirted around the knees. And like many of his peers, he proposed Bermuda shorts for both day and evening. A regular on the New York party circuit, Som whipped together evening coats in crochet, silk faille, and radzimir, along with fur toppers—including the requisite cape elongated below the knee and, for the ultimate lark, a fox muff—that his socialite pals will love.</p></div>"
93,fall,2005,f2005,phi,"Held in a studio high above Ninth Avenue, the Phi show was probably the most altitudinous of the week. In this aerie-like space, Andreas Melbostad presented a collection that showcased his eagle-eye precision tailoring and his strong, silhouette-driven vision for fall.</p><p>The first look, a double-breasted jacket with striped shirt and boy pants, was borderline preppy, but by look 14 the jacket was cropped, the shoulders broadened, and the pants pleated. ""We reapproached the classics, recutting and reproportioning them,"" Melbostad said backstage. Rendered entirely in black and white, the shapes and balances of the clothes—not to mention the tough, wedged, winkle pickery boots—referenced not only menswear but 1983, the year the Japanese took Paris, shrouding it in black and challenging its classic lines.</p><p>Mixed among the wool felts and camel hairs, napa leathers and flannels, which were cut into coats and jackets, were substantial cashmere sweaters and a number of silk pieces. The most successful of these were some black-and-white printed looks, like an easy shirt and draped skirt on Carmen Kass. The dresses, some studded, looked lost among the rest of the collection, which was, as the DJ described the soundtrack, ""industrial, rigid, and military."" If Melbostad continues on this path, he'll have no trouble finding conscripts.</p></div>"
94,fall,2005,f2005,pollini,"Rifat Ozbek's conceit for fall was a conflation of the sixties and the twenties. Like the wigs sported by his models (composed of a Louise Brooks bob plonked on top of a long fall of hippie locks), it made for a bemusedly busy mix of styles, with a slew of ethnic patterns, patchwork, and embroidery thrown in for good measure.</p><p>For all the high-spirited kookiness of the presentation, though, this isn't a collection for far-out fashion freaks. Separated out on a boutique rack, the gold lace pants, Empire-waist print dresses, fur-trimmed brocade bombers, and beaded coats will seem perfectly wearable to a mainstream shopper. And the label is showing definite signs of growth: This season, it has added striped boots and shoes by Georgina Goodman, and big soft leather sack bags that have the hallmarks of a house signature.</p></div>"
95,fall,2005,f2005,prada,"Even when there's nothing in the room, Miuccia Prada can send a powerful signal. For fall, she'd stripped her show space back to its bare industrial bones, and so it was with the collection. ""To go back to something structured, strong, and womanly, to strip back on stupid frills, print, and decoration"" was how she described her quest. ""But,"" she added, ""even though we are talking about minimalism again, it cannot be sad and depressing.""</p><p>Prada's opening declaration—a black wool Empire-line dress precisely seamed in a V under the bust and edged in lace at the knee—showed how skilled she is at navigating her way into a new mood. Tougher and darker, it still conveyed a shapely femininity—one that was concisely pulled together between the disciplined chic of a ballerina updo and a platform slingback. And dispensing with overdone surfaces revealed again what this designer stands for in terms of cut. Her top-seamed, sharp-lapelled, waist-defining coats, ballooning blousons, and swingy astrakhans showed an elegant command of volume gleaned from her lifelong obsession with couture classics.</p><p>Some looks, like the mohair V-neck sweaters, belted over narrow skirts and worn with patent opera gloves, referenced Prada's own previous work: the wearable pieces that make women seek out this label season after season. But she avoided nineties starkness with boldly modern roller prints on dresses and shirts, and quirky appliqués of crochet and passementerie on a series of coats. The magic is that none of this can be nailed down literally as retro or folkloric. And at a time when fashion is weary of theme shows, that's a quality that truly sets Prada apart.</p></div>"
96,fall,2005,f2005,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"The London Portobello Road couple Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton deserve respect for the way they've grown up and out of the grungy deconstructionism of the nineties, where they started. Their Preen collections now look almost unrecognizably clean and polished, though still reaching for an experimental kind of expression; and their instincts tend to take them in the right general direction, too. This season, like so many others, they've been working on loose, swingy volumes that fall from the shoulder to swirl around the knee.</p><p>That worked well for trapeze-shape jersey dresses with looped hemlines, an artier version of the peasant smock that's turning up all over as a London trend. Preen's coats and jackets, which often come with dramatically sliced lapels and soft gathers and flounces, also had a certain distinction. Unfortunately, their theoretical explorations of loops and folds ended up in some heavy encounters with chunky gray tweed, where the fabric won, and wearability sank out of sight. Never mind. Preen's development is interesting to watch, and all credit is due to them for surviving the toughest of fashion times as resolute independents.</p></div>"
97,fall,2005,f2005,proenza-schouler,"It's a mod world, at least at Proenza Schouler, where after a couple of seasons of pretty, feminine looks, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough injected their proceedings with a colorful, sometimes cheeky, dose of sixties pop. Courrèges came instantly to mind when their first model hit the runway in a black-and-white cashmere minidress, an orblike hat sitting atop her head. Later, the duo channeled Paco Rabanne with a chain mail tank and another made from small black and white discs, which also decorated slender clutches.</p><p>But this was no retro collection. There were Proenza Schouler trademarks aplenty—including bustier tops (a few of which took on the conic proportions of Jean Paul Gaultier's), great coats, and they-only-work-on-the-runway girdles—all of which showcased the duo's skillful seaming. These were layered, sometimes three and four at a time, with silk jersey tanks, cashmere knits, and trim blazers, capes, or coats in lush tweeds, herringbones, and houndstooths. Evening looks, on the other hand, were more pared down, as in color-blocked silk chiffon gowns that were cinched with satin belts.</p><p>The overall effect was more youthful than their recent presentations, but somehow that seems right. Hernandez and McCollough are major talents, with five hit collections and a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund prize under their belt. But they are also, after all, just a couple of 26-year-olds.</p></div>"
98,fall,2005,f2005,paco-rabanne,"With so many fashion houses going through a changing of the guard, every debut is avidly checked out by those in search of the next generation of contenders. Patrick Robinson, recently arrived from New York to design for Paco Rabanne, described his first show as clothes ""for women who like to be the center of attention in a room. That was what I took from looking at Paco Rabanne's first collection, of 12 chain-mail dresses: the fact that they were provocative and sexy.""</p><p>Still, provocative and sexy has to be appropriate for modern life, and that made Robinson resist launching his first mission directly into the retro space age. Instead, he sent out eveningwear for sophisticated young luxury seekers: strapless satin dresses wound around with flat, abstract ruffles; sheaths with alternating bands of matt and sheen, traced with crystal at the neckline; and sheer plissé Empire dresses with an erotic shadow of Chantilly lace beneath. Links to the house heritage did emerge, but subtly—in the suede chain belts riding on the hip of a wrapped shearling coat, or the disc pattern woven into the toe of gold and silver platform sandals.</p><p>Robinson's most seductive pieces fell nicely into that city-girl evening zone that's not about overdone red carpet gowns. They included a deliciously shapely mauve velvet dress, topped with a fox bolero; bomber jackets with epaulets and a twinkle of Lurex; and a narrow skirt overlaid with a delicate bubble of lace. ""I wanted the collection to be a palate cleanser, but this is the first step,"" he said backstage, as TV camera crews and editors pressed forward to congratulate him on the first signs of a reawakening at another Paris house.</p></div>"
99,fall,2005,f2005,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren's immaculate fall show was inspired by his personal collection of vintage cars, 13 of which go on display March 6 at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Close-fitting black leather jackets and skirts echoed the elegant curves of a very rare Bugatti, while the train of a strapless beaded dress evoked the tapered tail of an early Mercedes.</p><p>Paying homage to speed, Lauren thankfully avoided a theme that's been all too prominent this season: volume, which he dismissed in his opening sequence of strictly tailored gray fitted vests, below-the-knee skirts, and wrap coats. A parade of great menswear looks included a standout bold glen plaid trench, tossed with nonchalant confidence over the shoulders and teamed with a charmeuse shirt and cuffed houndstooth pants. Streamlined cashmere dresses, accented with leather epaulets and elbow patches, were pure luxe, and cropped jackets in fur-trimmed cognac leather and silvery shearling were just as sexy as his sleek trenches.</p><p>After dark, Lauren continued in a thirties vein. Matte jersey met silky charmeuse on simple columns, and Art Deco beading decorated the torso and trim of a silvery gown. The gender-bender suit and goggles sported by Erin Wasson were a misstep, as were the unfortunate skull caps inspired by Tamara de Lempicka's 1925 <em>Autoportrait</em>. But Lauren's pleated black tulle dress is worthy of an old-style Hollywood swoon.</p></div>"
100,fall,2005,f2005,ralph-rucci,"There could have been no greater contrast, on the last day of New York Fashion Week, than that between the Chado Ralph Rucci show and Jennifer Lopez's Sweetface debut. Trend driven, youth oriented, and mass marketed, the latter is everything Chado is not. Backstage at Chado, however, opera diva Renée Fleming and style icon Deeda Blair gushed with enough teenage ardor to rival any J. Lo fan.</p><p>That ardor was wholly deserved, for the workmanship of the clothes—particularly an aubergine alligator coat with insets, and a freshwater-pearl-embroidered bodice—was breathtaking. The first American to be asked to present couture in Paris, Rucci had to cancel his show there this season, but closed today with 15 looks that would have appeared during the spring couture.</p><p>Rucci described the theme of the collection as ""suspense, in both senses of the word,"" and it was true: Almost every look was pieced and hung back together with Calder-like precision. Highlights included a black crepe dress with insets; a suede-back golden sable coat, worn open and belted (the designer's luxe take on the puffer); an Empire dress and wrap, beaded after a Franz Kline painting; and a gown with an alligator torso that fell over a fuller underskirt constructed of a shower of quarter-size paillettes. Never mind the red carpet—this dress deserved an Oscar of its own.</p></div>"
101,fall,2005,f2005,riccardo-tisci,"The idea of discovering a young designer in Milan brought out the crowds to Riccardo Tisci’s presentation, even though it meant herding into a desolate, derelict factory late at night. There, they were met with the full conceptual works: a set clouded with church incense that included a full-size wooden cross, a blonde virgin, and what looked like a funeral pyre piled with dead leaves. Then, through the smoke emerged Mariacarla Boscono solemnly dressed in a floor-sweeping black cardinal coat, followed by many more of Tisci’s model friends, acting out a funereal fashion rite in the half-light.</p><p>What was discernible in the gloom were long-skirted silhouettes, topped with voluminous jackets, or more-sculpted raw-edged deconstructed leathers and furs with tight pencil skirts. Amid the spooky posturing and occasional sacrilegious pouting against the crucifix, some sinuous black dresses and beaded shearlings had impact. Though the proceedings, and many of the clothes, owed a lot to the influence of Martin Margiela and others of the somber school of Belgian design, Tisci is clearly a name worth watching.</p></div>"
102,fall,2005,f2005,richard-chai-love,"For a former knitwear designer—he was a creative director at TSE—Richard Chai certainly loves tailoring. Yes, there were delicate, fine-gauge pullovers and cardigans, but his sophomore solo effort was mostly an experiment in extreme seaming. Riffing on the intricately paneled bustiers and kimono tops of his debut, he added origami silk insets to the sides of a worsted wool dress, cinched paper-bag-waist trousers, and pegged skirts with overblown ivory bows, and added belts, necklaces, and headbands strung together from geometric pieces of quilted satin.</p><p>The effect, Chai explained backstage, was ""a fusion of the romantic and the futuristic."" Put another way, the designer worked feminine fabrics like silk against masculine materials such as striped suitings. He also replaced spring's ethereal, fuller shapes with more-structured ones, as in moleskin coats that were flared at the hem. There were some awkward moments: A boiled-wool skirt hung lifelessly from the waist (the dense fabric is better suited to jackets), and a red velvet top shied away stiffly from a model's shoulders. But saturated hues like bottle green and ultramarine were a welcome addition to this talented young designer's repertoire, as were his ""I'll take them in every color"" leg-elongating tapered trousers.</p></div>"
103,fall,2005,f2005,rick-owens,"How many women are ready to join the Rick Owens crypt club of fashion? That's an interesting question. When his subterranean goddesses rise to the surface for his shows, they can make a pretty terrifying sight. Rick's rockin' wraiths dress head to toe in felted, pilled fabrics, trailing skinny skirts in shades of dirt, gray, and mouse, and stomping forward on intimidatingly solid stiletto-heel boots. Should they turn their deathly pale faces and beckon, instinct might tell you to run quickly in the opposite direction.</p><p>But take a second look before you flee too fast. Even though Owens' total image is patently not for wimps, some of the individual components are brilliant—most obviously, the rough-hewn, bias cut shearlings and leather jackets that have been finding their way into so many women's wardrobes over the years. This season offered more irresistible pieces for the mainstream Rick collector, particularly the fierce cropped sheepskin gilets and boleros. Some of the sinuous skirts and flared pants in velvet would translate easily to life above ground, too. But taken as a whole? No. That's a place where only the brave—and the very strange—will ever go.</p></div>"
104,fall,2005,f2005,roberto-cavalli,"Who needs intellectual reasoning to understand the bouncingly energetic thrust of Roberto Cavalli's collections? What he has on offer is blatantly and gloriously obvious: glamour and flash and a damn good half-hour's fashion entertainment. His fall collection stretched that wimpy term ""eclectic influences"" to the limit—through the fierce side of the new black, seventies Saint Laurent, and silver screen Hollywood sirens with nary a stumble in self-confidence. (Unless you count the poor girl felled mid-runway by a gold lamé train.)</p><p>Since this was a show timed for the Oscars, Cavalli might just as well have run his triumphal Hollywood red carpet finale first. He called on classic images of feather-shouldered white satin, whalebone-corseted fishtail fuchsia, and powder-puff pink maribou in ways that channeled the glamour of Joan Crawford, Marilyn Monroe, or Mae West. Those, along with a trio of draped and pleated gold, silver, and greenish lamé goddess dresses attest to the breathtaking speed with which Cavalli has developed his camera-ready fashion in the space of a few seasons.</p><p>It's that velocity that makes the Cavalli performance such an enthralling spectacle. It also applies to the heavily decorated and befurred jackets and vests he does for day. That was where the Saint Laurent references came in handy, as in an emerald-green belted and studded suede jacket or a gold Russian quilted number richly edged in fur. If his homages to Yves, like the red velvet wrap-over gown with purple boots or the black tuxedo topped with a feather chubby are too loud for the sensitive, never mind. This is a designer who can show fashion a good time, and you can't help applauding that.</p></div>"
105,fall,2005,f2005,rochas,"She was an ethereal vision, palely advancing into focus: a girl dressed in a high-neck, frill-front blouse and a long slender skirt circled with minute, tufted ruffles. Edwardian, but not quite. And how on earth to describe that ghostly, barely tangible color? A fugitive mint-tinged gray perhaps, but never mind. The inadequacy of stock fashion vocabulary to nail what Olivier Theyskens does at Rochas is a good sign that something compelling is unfolding at this house. So leave it to the boy himself to put it into words: ""I wanted something more sober and restrained, but like the girls had been photographed in the morning sunlight.""</p><p>The voice of a true romantic, but one who demonstrates a precociously grown-up rigor in his thinking. With his new Edwardian silhouette in cream wool or mohair lace, or cut away at the shoulders to fall into soft tiers of lacy petals, Theyskens has made a distinct break from the fifties couture trend he started at Rochas in March 2003. (One which has influenced fashion ever since.) To make such a change, he taught himself to cut on the bias, which led to the new softness in his skirt trains, and the fluttering rivulets of chiffon that run along the length of a precious pale-pink printed gown.</p><p>But it's not just technique and restraint of mood that's moving this remarkable collection ahead of the copyists. Behind the reserved, otherworldly persona, Theyskens is a quick study. He understands the kind of women he's designing for, and they have a need for a shorter skirtsuit that can go from day to evening. Shapely variations of those appeared with scallop-edged peplums, trimmed with mink, or cut in black satin with Japanese influences. Together with his grand evening gowns for the young and beautiful, Theyskens is addressing the desires of other, sophisticated customers (age unspecified) who love acquiring amazing clothes. The fact that so many of them live in America adds substance to his broadening appeal.</p></div>"
106,fall,2005,f2005,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret may have given up his adopted London for the New York runways, but he could never abandon his French roots. Last season, he paid homage to Luis Buñuel's <em>Belle de Jour</em>, while for fall, he jumped back a couple of decades to the Hôtel du Nord and what he described in his program notes as the ""power and sensuality of forties Paris."" But whereas his spring suits and party dresses had a modern, wearable sensibility, there was something retro about Mouret's Veronica Lake looks. Yes, the collection was meticulously crafted, but his precision tailoring, especially when it came to needle skirts, left little room for his models to stride. Christian Louboutin's platform stilettos, while severely sexy, didn't help matters.</p><p>Where Mouret succeeded was with square-neck, puff-sleeve cocktail dresses, which were just as body-loving as his skirts but seemed to have a little more give. Lovely too were his coats, which ranged from a shrunken pea jacket to washed-leather numbers. The buttons of one brown trench were skewed diagonally across the side of the torso; topped with a houndstooth scarf, the outfit had an off-kilter insouciance. Meanwhile, his boleros, cut extra-fitted and above the bust, were a fine example of what's shaping up to be the topper of the season.</p></div>"
107,fall,2005,f2005,saint-laurent,"At Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, Stefano Pilati returned to the fray after a weird debut last season. Weird, that is, in the sense of the critical drubbing he received in some quarters, and weirder still (if his tulip skirts and ruffles were so awful) for the fact that they were widely copied this season. Still, the right kind of controversy can be a great thing for an emerging designer's profile, and the audience was packed in, on the edge of its seat, waiting to see whether Pilati would follow through with a collection powerful and personal enough to count as a fashion breakthrough.</p><p>Intellectually, Pilati is spot on in reading the current mood of restraint. “I think now we want to be chic, considered, and rigorous,” he said. “We want self-respect; and not to show our wealth so much.” To find imagery to anchor the collection, he looked at seventeenth century Flemish paintings of Jansenist nuns and clergy (a Catholic breakaway sect). “The key was that they were so obsessed with clean, perfect, pressed fabric; but there is rich detail in there, too.”</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>That explained why the show, longer, better staged, and more confident than last season, began with modifications of the broad-shoulder suitings of the YSL eighties, and then filtered in ecclesiastical cardinal gowns, clerical surplices, and high, frilled, choirboy collars. Still, the standout looks for day were the simplest ones. A strict black, form-fitting suit with a peplum jacket and a flounce breaking out below the knee cut a subtly erotic line. A yellow sweater, cinched with a wide belt encrusted with seeds, looked great over an egg-shape skirt. A brown blanket-stitched patchwork bolero and a glossy pony coat both exuded must-have originality.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""5cy9u""></div></div><p>Midway, Pilati got a bit bogged down. His past as an Italian fabric expert is a major plus for the house, but at times, he lost his grasp working complex surfaces, texture, and volume into wearable clothes. But for evening, something remarkable came walking along the runway: fluttery white chiffon with a high, frilled neck; a cardinal coat, buttoned from throat to floor, and then (with seemingly nothing to do with anything else, but no less brilliant for it), three Directoire plissé goddess gowns, gorgeous enough to tempt a saint. Is it all enough to qualify Stefano Pilati as a prophet in our time? We shall see, but judging by the gathering of the faithful backstage, he's already winning plenty of influential converts.</p></div>"
108,fall,2005,f2005,sari-gueron,"Sari Gueron is a hip young woman who designs the kind of clothes that she herself wants to wear. It's a simple strategy, and one that seems to be working. Gueron's fall collection, shown in the fin-de-siècle surroundings of Manhattan's Salmagundi Club (a haven for artists since the ninteenth century), was an object lesson in, well… hip young elegance.</p><p>In a tableau of 14 looks, Gueron worked the minimalist mood that's making itself felt now: pared down and simple, but not to the point of severity. It showed in the mix of slight-shouldered jackets edged with ruffles, worn over a lace wrap dress or an Empire-line evening gown; in the palette of black and navy brightened with flashes of ivory, peach, and a delicate shade of silvery blue; and in the judicious use of antique-look jewelry from Iradj Moini. Dresses have been a focus of her earlier collections, and she offered some good examples for fall: in particular, one with a U-shape neckline of flattened ruffles and another with gathers under the bust that subtly drew attention to the waist.</p><p>""It's not so romantic and draped this season,"" the designer said from the sidelines. ""It's much more sexy and grown up."" She looked a little shell-shocked as a stream of hip young editors stepped forward to congratulate her, voicing a constant refrain of ""It's just what I want to wear right now."" Seems like Gueron's study of her own sartorial needs has struck a chord.</p></div>"
109,fall,2005,f2005,sinha-stanic,"On the very day when London was smarting from a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> attack on its inability to muster wearable collections funded by serious businesses, its first new showing was a wearable, focused collection by Sinha-Stanic—funded, it so happens, by Aeffe, one of Italy's most serious fashion businesses. Fresh out of Central Saint Martins they may be, but Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic don't conform to any freaky, exasperating English stereotype. For a start, she's British-Indian and he's Croatian. Then there's their drapey, understated cut and interesting proportions, the kind that look good on a cool girl like Sinha. ""If she couldn't wear it, I wouldn't want to make it,"" said Stanic, sweetly.</p><p>They sustained that thought convincingly through a show that opened with a short cream belted wrap coat with rolled cuffs, which showed a flip of silver skirt beneath. Using jersey, crepe, chiffon, and the occasional herringbone tweed, they managed to balance their act between soft wrappings and easy structure. Slim dresses came with sequined apron tabards and suspender backs, or more simply, square-cut with a nice loose hang from the shoulder. Some of the layered jersey skirts and wispy tie-on tops were a tad overcomplicated, but the raglan-sleeve herringbone coat, with its larger shoulder line and leggy length slung a hip new proportion.</p><p>In all, this was a remarkably accomplished first outing for a pair of designers who competed for last year's hotly contested Fashion Fringe award, and lost by a squeak. The publicity rocketed them to the attention of Aeffe executives, who've gone fishing for the future of fashion this season in London's international gene pool.</p></div>"
110,fall,2005,f2005,sophia-kokosalaki,"Two things Sophia Kokosalaki does well are a leather bomber and a draped goddess dress. Working in her small sample-room-cum-studio in London's gritty Hackney, she also has good long-distance radar for mood, which this season has picked up accurate intelligence about militarism and a certain New Wave attitude. And that's what marched out, in the form of a lovely corded plissé jersey one-shoulder toga, two very current-looking twisted teal dresses shown on redheads, and a tough bomber embossed with markings that echo the frogging of a hussar's jacket.</p><p>But despite her talent and experience in her adopted city, Kokosalaki is effectively starting over as a rookie under the brighter and more unsparing lights of Paris. In this environment, even young designers' collections are judged against the technique, quality, and attention-holding coherence of the best and most brilliant. Unfortunately, this season Kokosalaki lost marks on those points, perhaps after expending too much effort on a complex leather placket and shoelace motif (gleaned from a book on Samurai armor), and struggling against budgetary constraints. But the fact that her reputation is capable of filling a room with the most-important editors and buyers (and at nearly 10 p.m., too) shows how many people are rooting for her to step up to the next level.</p></div>"
111,fall,2005,f2005,stella-mccartney,"Now that young women are in top spots at design houses, a baby boomlet has hit Paris. Both Stella McCartney and Chloé's Phoebe Philo are happily at home in London with their infants, Miller Willis and Maya Wigram, respectively, which leaves their teams to get on with their shows.</p><p>In McCartney's case, though, it seems she had the job done well before her visit last week to the delivery suite. Her fall collection was held together loosely with an eighties-sixties-Balenciaga theme, into which she rounded up her personal thoughts on volume, tweed, and the season's ubiquitous bubble skirt.</p><p>A big balloon-sleeve coat and a yoked wrap jacket opened the show, channeling both eighties Japan and Cristobal Balenciaga's monastic constructions. But McCartney's over-the-knee black leather boots grounded them in today. And the rest of the collection, too, read more as a young woman's take on current ideas than an earnest essay. Many of the pieces, like the oversize sweaters worn over leggings, were about translating the season into easy pieces.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""91egh6""></div></div><p>One standout was a houndstooth tweed drop-waist coat, with a slight pouf at the hem. The look's early-sixties couture vibe extended into the evening pieces, with dresses that melded corseted bustier tops with turned-under hemlines, the best of which was done in a lovely shade of red. But the outfit that caused most comment among the exiting crowd was the one worn by Elise Crombez midway through the show. It was a boxy, elongated sweater pulled over a loose silk dress, executed in the dirty-pink shades Stella McCartney has established as her signature. It demonstrated a perfectly pitched, no-nonsense approach to dressing she would do well to build on in seasons to come.</p></div>"
112,fall,2005,f2005,sweetface,"Lights! Camera! Fashion! Jennifer Lopez's first-ever runway production was a three-act carnival, filmed for an MTV documentary to air later this month. As the show progressed, an enormous neon set at the back of the catwalk flashed a fire escape (representing her childhood in the Bronx), followed by a DJ's turntables (J. Lo's hip-hop epoch), followed by a stretch limo and red carpet (the megastar-designer's made-it phase). There were video cameras on booms and in the aisles. They even installed wind and smoke machines.</p><p>The biggest surprise was the clothes themselves. Skin baring? Yes. Sexy? Of course. But luxe? We weren't the only ones to be amazed. From the first look to the last, fur figured strongly in Lopez's Sweetface collection. Boleros were whipped up in lambskin and fox. One intarsia cardigan that looked like a knit turned out, on closer inspection, to be woven mink. And there was even a sable. What's a girl to wear with all that fluff? Baby doll dresses in chiffon or velvet. Bubblegum-pink hoodies and faded jean Capris. And least practical, perhaps, but certainly most fabulous, cashmere microshorts. Oh, and don't forget the diamonds.</p><p>For the finale, Naomi Campbell strutted down the runway in a navel-baring silk chiffon jumpsuit and a white mink picture hat the size of an umbrella. But the applause she received, loud and plentiful though it was, paled in comparison to the standing O for Lopez.</p></div>"
113,fall,2005,f2005,temperley-london,"Those who turned up at the Temperley show expecting to see another few twirls of young Alice's signature twinkly pastel fairy dresses were in for a surprise. This season, the designer went for a far gutsier muse: a darkly smoldering Latin señorita who, judging from her red velvet Frida Kahlo coronet hairdo, seems to have arrived from somewhere down Mexico way.</p><p>Temperley is extending her repertoire to provide something more for her entranced young NY-Lon social audience than just the obvious party frocks. For winter, she upped her luxe-for-day quotient by adding intarsia knit dresses, fluted from under the bust, and embroidered shearling coats. Though her Latin theme led to stronger, darker colors, like plum and chocolate, and there was hint of the forties in her pintucked chiffon blouses, she was wise enough not to lay the references on too thick. After all, like small talk at a cocktail, nobody needs a designer like Temperley to turn intellectual on us.</p></div>"
114,fall,2005,f2005,tess-giberson,"""Arty"" is a label that has stuck to Tess Giberson since her 2000 debut, and it's easy to see why. Not only does she hand sew part of each garment she makes, but her personal history (rural upbringing as the daughter of artists, training at RISD, marriage to a painter) is pretty crunchy-bohemian, too. For fall, however, Giberson presented a collection that was as sophisticated as it was artful.</p><p>The soft-spoken Giberson decided to live quite large this season, in more ways than one; the designer is pregnant, and she chose to explore the theme of ""magnification."" That meant homing in on a single element of each of her 26 looks and enlarging it—""without losing sight,"" she said, ""of the overall proportions."" The results? A herringbone jacket with a top-stitched pocket that extended all the way around the side. A navy blazer with one giant button front-and-center. Blouses with huge cuffs finished with oversize braided cuff links. Enormous pleats on baggy trousers. Even the hair and makeup artists had fun with the idea: Models had Rapunzel-length ponytails or double braids extending down their backs, and half had exaggerated eyebrows while the others wore extended under-lashes. The designer redid the classic trench with eye-catching epaulets, and her silk dresses, many with raised waistlines and some accessorized by jewelry from Ninh Wysocan, were pretty with a capital P. ""Refined"" is the word that Giberson chose to describe her collection, and it's an apt one. Arty seems so… ""last season.""</p></div>"
115,fall,2005,f2005,thakoon,"With his second collection, Thakoon Panichgul proved to the eager buyers crowding his gallery installation that his well-received debut was no flash in the pan. Against a Mondrian-esque backdrop of blue, green, white, and yellow plastic rectangles, the youthful designer presented 15 lovely looks that, like last season, had all of the flourishes of neoclassicism. Thanks to an influential trip to Tokyo, however, these were ""knocked,"" as he put it, ""with sporty elements and shots of color.""</p><p>As a former fashion editor, Panichgul knows how hip young women like to dress. He tempered the romance of a white pencil skirt with black lace overlay, for example, with a tomboy's trim cardigan and plaid blazer with the sleeves pushed up, and teamed a girly tank made from laminated yellow silk with wool trousers and a long, rakish trench. He also knows how his female peers like to shop: for standout pieces, or ""items"" as they're known in the business. So he sandwiched white lace between two layers of see-through plastic to create a pea coat that just might be the rain jacket of the season.</p></div>"
116,fall,2005,f2005,tsumori-chisato,"Not since the Japanese first stormed the Paris scene, in 1983, has the Far East been such a preoccupation of the fashion flock—both in terms of trends (Roberto Cavalli's Ming vase prints) and business (new stores in China and/or Japan from Prada, Giorgio Armani, and Louis Vuitton). That's good timing for Tsumori Chisato, a designer who is ""big in Japan"" and now starting to make inroads into the Western market.</p><p>A graduate of Tokyo's renowned Bunka Fashion College, Chisato started working in 1977 for Issey Miyake, who helped her launch her own line in 1990. She first brought her collection to Paris in 2003 and has been quietly building street cred with cool girls in Los Angeles and New York. Her fall collection stayed faithful to her aesthetic, which is print-heavy with a healthy dose of manga/bohemian cuteness. The show took wing with the first look, an owl-appliqué minidress, and closed with homey quilted frocks that tied into the vague Bloomsbury theme at play throughout. There were a number of pretty dresses: some dramatic with pile stripes, a requisite velvet number, and others with tree appliqués and a patchwork of fun, flirty prints. The second look was a simple white pinafore that recalled <em>Peter Pan</em>'s Wendy—and served as a reminder that, for every governess that came down the runways this season, there is a corresponding youthful charge. Chisato is ready to dress her.</p></div>"
117,fall,2005,f2005,tuleh,"Last season, Bryan Bradley decided to shock Tuleh out of its traditional, Upper East Side sensibility, sending satin jumpsuits and fetishy rubber coats down the runway in place of the usual ladylike tweed jackets and elegant cocktail dresses.</p><p>Bradley took the same tack for fall, but softened the shock factor. He capitalized on the label's strengths—fantastic dresses, wonderful prints, exotic colors—while injecting them with just enough of a hip, young edge. The starting point for the collection is probably best described as ""throw it on and see what happens."" Hence the lavender and brown brocade duffel coat over a teal chiffon dress, or the shrunken, multicolored tweed jacket over a long black floral dress. It would be fair to say that the more out-there moments—the camouflage fox furs and satin cargo shorts—will only make it into a minority of wardrobes. But there will be heavy demand for those dresses. Whether it was a chiffon gown in a fuchsia, gold, and brown floral that evoked the look of Pratesi prints from the 1970's, or a brown evening dress that dramatically trailed the floor in its wake, Tuleh delivered glamour with a touch of grit.</p></div>"
118,fall,2005,f2005,undercover,"Jun Takahashi's Undercover show always brings a jolt of weirdness to Paris. The surprise this season was that he staged his enigmatic commentary on classic-meets-rocker menswear for women in the gilded ballroom of the Grand Hotel, instead of some derelict den on the city limits.</p><p>Strange morphings and trompe l'oeil effects are givens at Undercover. For fall, they involved menswear vests compressed onto felted shirts; cross and key necklaces printed onto T-shirts; scarves that grew out of lapels; and (sharp intake of breath all round) chrome chains and razor blades embedded in a white tuxedo jacket. New, skewed takes on tomboy dressing included cord drainpipes cut with the wale running horizontally, and sloppy, crushed-down biker boots, also in corduroy.</p><p>Some of Takahashi's raw edges and inside-out seaming veered too far into territory already covered by the designer's mentor, Rei Kawakubo; but things came back strongly for an original ending. The last few exits were outsize Mongolian-lamb coats and giant feather wraps, imitating the luxury outerwear shown on so many Milanese runways this season. Except that the Undercover versions are cut out of felt. An ironic comment? Hard to tell. But they looked ineffably cooler than most of the originals.</p></div>"
119,fall,2005,f2005,united-bamboo,"At first, United Bamboo's fall show seemed headed perilously close to territory previously charted by Balenciaga's Nicolas Ghesquière, with its play on A lines and circular volume, and Koos van den Akker-esque paneled inserts of different fabrics on shoulders and sleeves. But what emerged in the end was something rather more original.</p><p>The inspiration for this collection, revealed Thuy Pham—he designs the line in conjunction with Miho Aoki—was Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 movie <em>Solaris</em>. ""We wanted to reference science fiction,"" said Pham backstage, ""but not to be too literal. We contrasted the geometric, sculptural look of the clothes with natural wools and tweeds."" Their approach worked best with the gray wool jersey dresses layered with gray tops, one of which was adorned with panels of bright lime, pink, and blue; militaristic flannel minidresses, one in camel, the other in black; and a soft, yet severe, pleated shirt and skirt that looked like it would have passed muster with the Politburo.</p><p>What really intrigued, though, was an influence that seemed to come from closer to home. Those zippers that etched the body? That intricate, eye-catching contrast of fabrics? Traces, perhaps, of the work of the late Geoffrey Beene, making contact with a whole new generation.</p></div>"
120,fall,2005,f2005,valentino,"Valentino's ultrachic collection filtered many of the strongest trends of the moment for the woman who wants her fashion leavened with a highly developed sense of well-bred elegance.</p><p>Against a runway of smoky mirrored lozenges suggesting the Argyle pattern that appeared (via elaborate intarsias and appliqués) on clothing and accessories throughout the collection, Valentino opened with a battalion of skinny pantsuits. He was inspired by turn-of-the-century men's uniform pants with their high waists, impeccable cut, and gentle boot-leg flare. Even the palette of red, black, and beige emphasized this martial spirit—as did the sharp wool capes. And his abbreviated, high-waist jacket seemed to extend even further the leg of pants that already seemed to go on forever.</p><p>But Valentino's loyal ladies also like to look feminine when the occasion demands, so those narrow jeans (with pockets in crocodile or python) and sable-trimmed bombers made way for airy lingerie cocktail frocks prettily composed of chiffon ruffles and dainty Valenciennes lace trim—protected from the winter weather with hourglass coats (one with the effect of corset cross-lacing in back to emphasize the point).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""0n20ck""></div></div><p>Valentino showed some looks from his January men's collection, recalling the Russian theme that dominated that show. They reappeared for women in suede boleros with trim of curled ostrich feathers (in luxurious imitation of Mongolian lamb), or jackets in the ubiquitous astrakhan. Another crossover from the men's collection were the newsboy caps, making accessory news this season, and luxuriously reinterpreted here in sheared mink and crocodile.</p><p>Valentino's couture touch brought exquisite workmanship to filmy lace blouses and brocade jackets as well as evening gowns that captured the season's passion for Victorian and Edwardian effects. A tiny beige and silver jacket that wouldn't have been out of place in the court of Nicholas and Alexandra was worn with slim flannel pants; a jet beaded capelet shrugged over a blouse frothing with lace; and courtly evening gowns had Tissot trains composed of tiers of ruffles. But Valentino can also pull off effortless chic, as he did with a superb white charmeuse crepe floor-length shirtwaist, trellised with lace ruffles.</p></div>"
121,fall,2005,f2005,vera-wang,"Last September, Vera Wang showed a spring collection that was one of the highlights of the season, proving that she was capable of much more than just dressing a woman for her wedding day. Sadly, her fall show left you feeling like you'd been jilted at the altar, waiting for a vision of loveliness that never showed up.</p><p>Wang sent out a large number of chiffon evening dresses, but all the deliciously rich-yet-light colors she showed for spring were traded in for a palette that consisted mainly of dour blacks and browns, with some challenging shades of green and terra-cotta for contrast. And the accessory that took center stage—a fur bonnet tied under the neck—was an unusual choice, to say the least. There were arty, Empire-line tops, whisper-thin cardigans, and full tweed or brocade skirts, tricked up with dressmaker-like tucks and folds; but there wasn't enough here to get a woman through her working day. It's not that Wang needs to churn out corporate-friendly clothes—she's far too individual and spirited for that—but interpreting wardrobe-friendly basics in her own way could be intriguing. (There were some effective little fuller jackets, which have become one of this coming fall's key pieces, here done with a pleated, Empire back, and in soft velvet.)</p><p>The wonderful thing about Wang is that, through her bridal business, she has mastered the art of merging fairy-tale fantasy with hard reality, dressing women of every shape and size for that all-important day. Now the challenge is to make that marvelous empathy cross over.</p></div>"
122,fall,2005,f2005,veronique-branquinho,"It's official: Veronique Branquinho has gone over to the dark side, showing an entirely black collection for fall. Not that she had far to go; this is a designer who's always had a taste for the gothic.</p><p>Although the first outfit's brass-buttoned jacket suggested a military theme to follow, the collection ultimately focused on basics—blazers and sweaters, knee-length skirts, and beautifully cut pants, most in sturdy wools and leather. Branquinho's forays into menswear (she launched her first men's collection in January 2003) have clearly influenced her thinking; other clues to what this collection was about could be found in the music (Depeche Mode and Kate Bush) and several hip toppers with an eighties feel—like a windbreakery number on Caitriona Balfe and a leather jerkin-meets-motorcycle-jacket on Katia Kokoreva.</p></div>"
123,fall,2005,f2005,versace,"Donatella Versace's quest to reenergize her company began in a great place for fall; whatever spirit had gone missing over the past few years was symbolically retrieved by the fact that she made her models look like modern goddesses. The aura of glamour that sparked off the flying hair and luminous faces of Carmen Kass, Daria Werbowy, Eugenia Volodina, and Karen Elson was a strong reminder of what once made Versace electrifying. And that a show can be something more exciting than watching a few wan girls walk listlessly up and down a runway.</p><p>As the world knows, Donatella is back from rehab, and the effect on her work is visible. In a mood to clean up and face reality, she's pared down the clothes and focused 85 percent of her collection on daywear. That essentially means a streamlined version of Versace <em>classico</em>, with most of the clanking Medusa gilt stripped off. Not that the sex factor has been censored out altogether. Versace coats come with a nipped waist and a voluptuous shawl collar, and swingy skirts and boot-leg pants are seamed to present a rock chick's back view in the most provocative way on earth. Apart from a couple of tightly draped jersey print dresses, the plain colors (white, turquoise, lime, and fuchsia) let the quality of the cut and fabric do the talking.</p><p>The usual mind-numbing lineup of Versace gowns was confined to five stunning dresses from the Atelier collection, each outstanding—especially the one in fluid black and dark-green chain mail patterned in whorls, on Daria. It was a worthy reminder of the great old days that would have made her brother proud.</p></div>"
124,fall,2005,f2005,viktor-rolf,"Just as fashion fatigue threatened to set in at the collections, Viktor &amp; Rolf dreamed up a fantasy solution: Why not go to work in your bed? Lily Cole, for one, appeared on set with her red hair splayed out on a pristine, lace-edged cotton pillow and a neatly folded-over sheet inserted into the neck of her coat. She led a troupe of fellow sleep-deprived models, all in V &amp; R’s surprisingly chic renderings of bedclothes: shirts that were part sheets, with all the eyelet trims and frills intact; comforting duvet coats with huge wolf-trimmed collars; suits fashioned from quilts; and charmeuse boudoir sheets wrapped into evening dresses.</p><p>The somnambulist girls circled a stage where Tori Amos sat at a grand piano, premiering a specially commissioned 15-minute composition set to the biblical words of the Song of Solomon. “I sleep walked, my heart waketh,” she sang, dramatically tossing her mane of crimped red locks. Sound mad? It was, but in a gentle sort of way. Fashion needs an occasional nudge of performance lunacy, if only to keep itself awake. And in any case, these days, Viktor &amp; Rolf don’t allow surrealist antics to block the view of their increasingly accomplished way with smartly normal clothes.</p><p>These included some of the season’s best black tuxedo pants, dashing black raincoats with fan-pleated storm flaps, and a pea coat with frilled edges. In the sheet department, shirts with broderie anglaise edgings and folded fronts were a great contribution to the season’s growing white shirt trend. And a beautiful charmeuse and lace gown (embroidered with a red rose, like a love token left on a pillow) proved that Viktor &amp; Rolf are learning how to whip up dresses for a dreamy night.</p></div>"
125,fall,2005,f2005,wunderkind,"At Wolfgang Joop's sophomore New York show, each model was followed down the dark runway with a spotlight, creating an intimate focus on the clothes and showcasing, the designer said, ""the investment of workmanship in each piece."" And what workmanship it was. A majority of the looks, like a sand-colored suede dress worn with flats or a flouncy taffeta number paired with ballerina-style pumps, featured meticulous piecework in an abstract wave pattern that captured the designer's concept for the collection: movement. ""Fashion is not art,"" he said. ""It comes alive when someone is wearing it. And in New York —where the designer lives in Bill Blass's former apartment—there is no rest.""</p><p>A red taffeta coat popped; tweed toppers had oversize buttons and fur trim; and a coat of sheared fur, dyed navy, had all the subtleness of velvet. Joop's technical virtuosity was better spent on the dressy pieces than on some of the tweedy daywear which, when pieced and deconstructed, tended to get bulky. For the most part, though, this was a collection that reflected a designer in cool control of his talent.</p></div>"
126,fall,2005,f2005,yohji-yamamoto,"From the first outfit in this strong collection—a long, lean coat-dress in brilliant fuchsia, fastening to one side with giant chiffon bows in various shades of pink—it was clear that Yohji Yamamoto had a statement to make. Building femininity into his severely chic signature tailoring, he used chiffon and organza to romance the clothes: chiffon for the streamers that laced up the back of one jacket like the fastenings of a corset; organza for the ruffles that buoyed out the peplum of another. Some tailored pieces that seemed to be crafted from light woolens proved, on closer inspection, to have been constructed from <em>mille feuilles</em> layers of chiffon instead.</p><p>That shock of color in the beginning soon segued into the funereal black-on-black effects that showcase the operatic impact of Yohji's bold silhouettes, with their elaborate portrait necklines, spaniel's-ear collars, or overscale asymmetric button fastenings. But then the rockabilly soundtrack paused for dramatic effect, and he sent out asymmetric pieces in layered solid-color chiffons that sandwiched an unexpectedly psychedelic swirling Lava lamp print. Eugene Souleiman's elaborate hair constructions somehow melded Teddy boy quiffs with the messy cottage loaf of the put-upon Edwardian cook, as well as offering a clue to the designer's eclectic vision: a biker toughness out of <em>The Wild One</em> mixed with a belle époque softness that owed more to the heroines in <em>Death in Venice</em>.</p><p>Evening looks had all the drama of a midcentury René Gruau fashion sketch—and seemed drawn with the same bold sweep of that artist's Japanese ink brush. True to Yohji's theme, sweeping skirts or romantic coat-dresses with billowing 1830's sleeves were ignited with Elvis-in-Vegas embroidery of chandelier crystal drops—and the gleaming metal rivets from a biker's prized leather jacket.</p></div>"
127,fall,2005,f2005,zac-posen,"Those ice sculptures installed at the back of Zac Posen's runway? It's a wonder they didn't melt, what with the star wattage on hand—show regulars Claire Danes and Sean Combs, a co-owner of Posen's company, turned up, as did Ashley Olsen, Bette Midler, Russell Simmons, Jay-Z, and Foxy Brown.</p><p>They saw a fall show in which Posen zeroed in on Hollywood's glamour years, turning out bias-cut liquid silk columns in shimmering pastels, and (paging Joan Crawford) bubble-sleeve blouses with hip-loving skirts. He also showed a fair amount of drapey goddess gowns, some embellished with golden coils at the neck and waist. On the more constructed side, an emerald strapless moiré silk dress demonstrated his hourglass fit, while a pleated charmeuse number in slate gray showcased his talent for pattern making.</p><p>Posen's alpaca coats seemed oddly informal next to all that flash, and he didn't show much in the way of daywear compared with his efforts for spring. But that's not what his people come for: The leaner and loucher a gown was, the louder the claps from the Combs-helmed cheering section.</p></div>"
128,fall,2005,f2005,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo's compact fall collection, shown as an in-store installation, was organized into groups by color: ink blue, chocolate brown, black, eucalyptus, antique silver. Like the palette, the fabrics were soft: velvets, cashmeres, jersey, even faux fur, all worked into eminently wearable pieces meant to be mixed and matched to create interesting lines. Long sweaters were paired with leggings and balloon or handkerchief-hemmed skirts, and grounded with Frye boots, while coats were worn open and belted under the breast, creating an Empire silhouette that also showed up in velvet evening dresses.</p><p>Always thinking about volume and form, Cornejo is uniquely equipped to shine in a season centered on these concerns, and this collection was one of her strongest. It was largely inspired by the work of 72-year-old American sculptor Lee Bontecou, whose work was recently exhibited at MoMA. ""It gave me hope,"" Cornejo said of the sculptor's show. ""I hope I can still be making things when I'm that age."" As do we.</p></div>"
1,spring,2006,s2006,a-f-vandevorst,"Before Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst's show began, a young woman took to the stage of the Elysée Montmartre with an LED screen strapped around her neck that read: ""No flash photography, PLEASE."" The odd request likely had something to do with the elaborate stage setup—models stood behind a curtain facing a mirror angled toward the audience that displayed only their reflections before they descended a set of steps and made a winding path around the runway—but one can't be sure. What was vaguer still was the connection that arrangement had to their spring collection. This Belgian team might be better off skipping the complicated staging and focusing on their clothes, which were often good, especially a dress of frothy white and gold lace that peeked out from beneath an iridescent raincoat.</p><p>For the most part, the looks were monochrome: A slouchy, off-one-shoulder jersey tee topped a pair of eighties leggings and a leather cummerbund, all in black; a tiered lace, below-the-knee backless vest was attached by hook and eye to a canvas skirt, both in white; and a fitted khaki blazer was worn with chiffon pants just a shade lighter and gathered at the knee. Despite the distraction of faded text printed on everything from cuffed cotton shorts to a leather bomber, their tailoring looked as strong as ever. Coats, many fastened with oversize plastic buttons, were among the show's standouts.</p></div>"
2,spring,2006,s2006,akris,"The precision with which Albert Kriemler cuts his clothes—to say nothing of the efficiency of his presentation—came as a welcome tonic amid spring's endless frills (the ruffles! the bows! the lace!) and elaborate setups. Backstage, Kriemler described the starting point of his collection as a nude plissé blouse worn by Anjelica Huston in a 1973 Richard Avedon portrait. ""It was its simplicity and lightness,"" he said, ""that moved me.""</p><p>Kriemler did a deft job of charting the season's trends, too, starting with those pleats and continuing with subtle colors including aubergine, mushroom, and smoke. These came together beautifully in a nude (the noncolor of the season), accordion-folded frock with a deep V-back. Embellishments included tulle leaves hand-stitched onto organza; perforated-leather swing coats looked lighter than air; and crocheted cardigans had enough heft to stand in for a blazer.</p><p>But Akris is really all about those dependably chic pantsuits. To persuade customers who already have a closetful of his short jackets, and perhaps convince new (younger?) ones, Kriemler lengthened his spring styles to the hips, cinched them with a belt, and raised armholes for a look he described as ""rock star—but Akris rock star.""</p></div>"
3,spring,2006,s2006,alberta-ferretti,"These days, what's significant about Alberta Ferretti's collections comes at the end of her shows, when she sends out her victory parade of long dresses. Dramatically framed in a spotlight, they embody the drift toward a less eroticized, more fragile special-occasion prettiness that appeals to Young Hollywood. Sex-bomb bling is definitively over.</p><p>The fashion news from this collection was compressed into that last sequence: Empire line, traily grosgrain bows beneath the bust, pale chiffon draped over opaque linings, and a vague glance in the direction of an arty, early twentieth-century Poiret-influenced silhouette.</p><p>As for the buildup to this finale, it too was a light run-through of 1900's Arts and Crafts references—a train of thought instigated by last season's excursion into the Wiener Werkstätte at Louis Vuitton. There were loose, color-blocked dresses (Milan is rejecting the waist, by the way) made from panels of pleated chiffon and charmeuse, as well as painted ivy leaf and checkerboard motifs co-opted from Viennese café tile designs. Nothing scarily intellectual, of course—but Ferretti has found a clever way to seize the moment.</p></div>"
4,spring,2006,s2006,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua channeled Marilyn for spring—her curvaceous bustier dresses, her straining pencil skirts, her crystal-spangled ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President"" gown, the lips, the lot. As a designer cliché, that, of course, ranks as the all-time No. 1. Still, in a season when fifties influences are still playing, Dell'Acqua just about managed to get away with it, using the ubiquitous icon as a convenient device for showcasing his view of dressing up for evening.</p><p>On the runway, there was also a Helmut Newton-ish, seventies kind of slant, teetering on the brink between good taste and vulgarity. Marilyn lips—molded into Plexiglas belt clasps, scattered as prints, or turned out as pink plastic buttons on knits—came over as a bit of Pop Art fun. Shiny lacquered stretch-chiffon skirts were definitely a tad too brash, but some of the black-lace-over-nude dresses, handled with Dell'Acqua's customary sensitivity for lingerie, were delicate enough to satisfy the fashion police.</p></div>"
5,spring,2006,s2006,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen has changed. The commanding impresario who once took delight in scaring and astonishing his audience with stadium-filling shows and designing at the brink of scandal has—if we're to judge by the past two seasons—joined the regular ranks of ready-to-wear designers who line up their models like soldiers and march 'em on out with the collection.</p><p>What that leaves us with is a clear view of clothes. Black suits, to start with—and though you couldn't exactly call them straight, something's changed in the cut of their jib, too. For spring, McQueen's signature tailoring has lost its exaggerated waist and jutting shoulders, and been replaced by more-wearable spencers with buttoned-back lapels. Beneath, he shows short flippy skirts, shorts, or pants with black opaque tights. There's a faint girl-rocker air about them—and a cape with a silver-beaded phoenix on the back somewhere in there—but nothing to scare the horses.</p><p>For night, the part of the show McQueen said was inspired by Greek goddesses, things took a turn for the disappointing—tiny pleated silver lamé dresses, white crystal-beaded gowns and pieces made in bandage wrappings of white or gold elastic. The slot formerly occupied by his showstopping extravaganzas is now serviced by metalwork body costumes with all the finesse of something left over from an eighties sci-fi TV series. Gone, even, are the staggeringly made, couture-grade fantasy gowns that have brought so many brides banging on his door. Though some of his moves are clearly being made in an effort to sell—no criticism in itself—this show, from a designer whose capabilities have won such respect, was a letdown.</p></div>"
6,spring,2006,s2006,alexandre-herchcovitch,"The Brazilian designer Alexandre Herchcovitch is big on theatrics. Two seasons ago, he introduced his line in New York by building a garden on the runway. His sophomore collection featured live musicians trailing every model. This spring, he combined his favorite flourishes by using flowers, in the form of botanical prints, and a live performance from the Brooklyn-based neo-tropicalia freak-funk band Animal Collective.</p><p>While the production and the clothes delivered the drama, the collection fell short in the wearability department. Puffy, tiered dresses layered over patterned tops and cinched with wide leather belts. Mad mixes of psychedelic florals with Mary Quant-style daisies (featured on a rubber skirt) clashed with an op print (whipped up into a wonderful belted trench) and a few plaids, thrown in for good measure. This collection was a trip, in every sense of the word. Even the band, surrounded by Plexiglas mushrooms, sang about hallucinogenic pills. Herchcovitch cited the ""freedom movement"" as his inspiration, and he succeeded in conveying a sartorial sort of sixties psychedelia, however out of step it may be with the prevailing minimal mood.</p><p>Let's hope Herchcovitch bought a round-trip ticket, and that when this journey ends, he'll return to pursue his exuberant visions with a bit more temperance.</p></div>"
7,spring,2006,s2006,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"No one ever accused Vivienne Westwood of being shy about expressing her opinions, and she stayed true to form with her occasionally heavy-handed new collection. She dubbed her show <em>AR</em> for ""active resistance to propaganda,"" and some of the least compelling looks were splashed graffiti-style with those initials. In a repeat of last season, several models wore chokers and belt buckles that spelled ""branded,"" while others sported tank tops with the slogan ""I am not a terrorist""—as did the designer herself when she came out for her own leisurely stroll down the runway. The subversive wit that 30 years ago led Westwood to print two naked cowboys across a T-shirt has given way to a blunter approach, but it remains to be seen how many of her customers want to look like a walking political statement.</p><p>Still, London's grande dame of punk has certainly earned the right to speak her mind, and she remains a muse for many of fashion's current up-and-comers—which may explain why her extreme, fitted jackets and tousled, asymmetric ball gowns looked familiar. (Her signature tartans, in fact, had made an appearance across the Seine earlier that very morning at Junya Watanabe.) She stayed one step ahead of the youth brigade, though, with her knits, which looked great in muted intarsias. And those taffeta dresses were pure Westwood, with their echoes of both high school proms and Rembrandt. They could have been designed with one of her more conspicuous celebrity guests, nouveau burlesque artist Dita Von Teese, in mind. Despite the 11:30 a.m. time slot, Von Teese's trademark décolletage was on full display—here clearly was one customer not inclined toward slogan tees.</p></div>"
8,spring,2006,s2006,andrew-gn,"Over the course of four years in business, Andrew Gn has built himself a coterie of Upper East Side fans who keep his rich-looking coats, with their demi-couture details, flying out of Bergdorf and Bendel. Given the new direction evident in his spring collection, though, it looks like Gn has the potential to make the leap downtown—embracing the girls who are bar-hopping at the Stanton Social, as well as those who are lunching at Le Bilboquet.</p><p>This season, the designer's signature coats came in black and white gabardine and crepe, sumptuously embellished with waistbands of glass beads or lace edging, while sportier versions were cut in silk toile and decorated with bohemian (by Gn's standards, at least) wooden beads. Since this is spring, he also showed off-the-shoulder smocked tops in cotton piqué or floral-print silk. For evening, patchworks of those floral prints fell in tiers to the floor, in keeping with one of the season's big trends—although the same silhouette looked more modern in a striking emerald-green chiffon.</p><p>Which brings us to the point. Gn's sexy new shoes, which made their runway debut, are proof that he has what it takes to connect with a younger generation. Now all he needs is to lose the prim styling—and lengthen his too-short skirts to the knee—and he'll be as popular below 14th Street as he is on Park Avenue.</p></div>"
9,spring,2006,s2006,ann-demeulemeester,"When editors and buyers walked into Ann Demeulemeester's Boulevard Berthier venue tonight, they were greeted by waiters balancing trayfuls of Champagne. A peace offering after the icy conditions at last season's show? Could be, but any buzz the bubbly stuff provided had dissipated by the time the first look hit the runway, an hour and ten minutes behind schedule.</p><p>As it turned out, the thirties-flavored gowns Demeulemeester showed in white or black did look as elegant and alluring as a brimming flute. That's not entirely an idle metaphor: Her evening silhouette was almost unfailingly long and narrow on the bottom and frothily layered on the top. Silk halters and tanks provided coverage under crinkly vests, billowy blouses (really just sleeves attached to each other across the shoulders and back), and blatant showpieces made from arrow-thin feathers.</p><p>The overall effect was frankly rather tricky, especially at a time when women are rediscovering the joy of a little black dress. Luckily, for day she kept things simpler. Bejeweled swags and bibs that hung from the hips or neck almost certainly won't make it into stores, but her full trousers and swaggering jackets will, and that should keep her ardent fans—the kind who wouldn't leave the house in a ruffle—coming back for more.</p></div>"
10,spring,2006,s2006,anna-molinari,"Rossella Tarabini has run away to become a showgirl in a nightclub—and she looks all the better for it. Her Anna Molinari clothes always appeared a bit fake-young on the sterile runway of the official Fiera venue. By taking her shredded dresses to a gritty dive and roughing up some of the styling touches, she added bit more believability to her profile. (Though, on a day of traffic gridlock, few thanked her for the endless schlep across town to witness it.)</p><p>The show's feathers, tattered tulle, scrappy lace, and occasional Folies Bergère ooh-la-la satin corset jibed with the general mood of a cool girl playing the off-duty soubrette for an evening out. And sneakers, gloves, and the odd baggy cardigan kept the saccharine mostly at bay. One white puff-sleeve, rickrack-trimmed baby-doll dress did slip past the bouncers, but for the first time, this show demonstrated the context in which Tarabini's clothes might really be worn.</p></div>"
11,spring,2006,s2006,anna-sui,"For spring, Anna Sui stole a page from the <em>Gazette du Bon Ton,</em> the collectible early twentieth-century French magazine that published illustrations of the Deco era's top fashions. Many designers have focused on the surface treatments of designer Paul Poiret and his contemporaries this season, but Sui opted to concentrate on his uncorseted, loosened-up silhouettes and lovely, painterly prints.</p><p>She sent out a stream of fluid dresses in butterfly stripes and leaf motifs, waffle plaids and every kind of floral. Silhouettes ranged from baby doll to granny, with waistlines below the bust or dropped down to the hips, and there were handkerchief hems aplenty. In case you didn't make the connection, she accessorized most looks with that flapper favorite, a long ropey necklace trimmed with a tassel. After dark, those twenties babies loved their sequins, and Sui had them in spades, studding mesh tunics, tap pants, and Naomi Campbell's tank dress finale in eye-catching geometric arrangements.</p></div>"
12,spring,2006,s2006,aquascutum,"The latest challenge of refashioning a square old British brand into acceptable shape for the twenty-first century has fallen to Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler. Back in the day, Aquascutum was a venerable raincoat brand and gents' and ladies' suit maker, but now, under new Japanese management, it finds itself in the same position as Burberry ten years ago—a moneymaker, but nowhere on the fashion radar.</p><p>Herz and Fidler, in their second season on the runway, are attacking their problem by romancing the technology of the raincoat and co-opting pieces of a man's wardrobe for women. Herz said he imagined what would happen if a couple washed up on an Indonesian shore with one suitcase intact. The result—somewhat more intellectual than the costumes of <em>Lost</em>—is essentially a collection of floppy, washed, sometimes cut-up trench coats, crinkly sun-dried cottons, and dresses made from patchworks of Indonesian checked fabrics. All, supposedly, what the pair would end up with, once they'd started improvising with what clothes they had, pieced together with local finds.</p><p>Well, the Aquascutum castaway would need a good sewing machine to wash up alongside that suitcase if she wanted to wear stuff like this. Apart from one beautiful long dress made out of pinstripe shirting, Aquascutum's Indonesian print and toile de Jouy dresses were short and fitted and cut with a multiplicity of complex darts and gathers, complete with every seam meticulously finished with bias binding. True to the company's reputation for reversible raincoats, Herz promised that each and every garment was as beautifully finished inside as out.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""0d4cuy""></div></div><p>But in the end, the guys need to learn a bit about woman-think. No woman obsesses over the way the inside of her dress is finished like Herz and Fidler. By the time the show was over, their absorption with such details left them with what looked like a zillion renditions of the same dress, in everything from a bright seed-packet floral to a gilded linen. Although these were paired with different treatments of the trench—a cropped bolero jacket, a puffy dark muslin—a new vision for the brand has yet to be completely articulated.</p></div>"
13,spring,2006,s2006,as-four,"Minus Kai Kühne, it was business as usual for the remaining three members of As Four—Adi, Ange, and Gabi—who presented their spring 2006 collection in their ""renegade"" store on Broadway. Music came courtesy of Sean Lennon on baby grand, accompanied by a band called Meta Four, which performance artist Michael Portney formed specifically for the occasion.</p><p>The collection visited familiar territory, with one significant difference: It was rendered almost completely in denim. Pleat details on pants had an accordion-like, almost industrial feel. One pair of trousers with sheer inserts in the shape of lighting bolts at the back of the leg was more than a little bit rock 'n' roll. Drapey tops in inky-blue silk georgette, embellished with sequins and metallic laces, were among the highlights. There were lots of evening dresses on offer, the most dramatic being a floor-length piece with sheer inserts and gypsylike medallions that made their own folky music as the model walked.</p><p>Though this was a well-edited collection that showed the trio in good form, the most-exciting news was not about what was on the runway. For its new ""black line,"" available in the store, the team has recreated its greatest hits, again in denim. Free of bells and whistles, these pieces allow the strength of the team's patternmaking to come through loud and clear.</p></div>"
14,spring,2006,s2006,badgley-mischka,"Though the black-windowed vans with flashing lights and Maryland plates on 11th Avenue were a reminder of pressing world events and the week's affairs at the United Nations, the prevailing mood at the Badgley Mischka show at the Waterfront (formerly the Tunnel) was one of escapist celebration. The duo has returned to the runway with a new backer Iconix (formerly Candie's) after a two-season hiatus.</p><p>The chandeliers dripping with ferns and orchids, and the perfectly coiffed socialites dotting the front row, made the atmosphere feel like a society wedding reception, which suits the designers' aesthetic just fine. There were plenty of mother-of-the-bride dresses to choose from, and, thankfully, the mounds of beading from prior collections gave way to refreshing tiers of lace and tulle, lush satin and chiffon. A real effort was directed at daywear, and the result was conservatively chic tweed dresses and jackets, sweater sets, and beaded tanks. A black jacket layered over a long tank worn with shorts was surprisingly trendy. The unexpected combination of crystal beading on sandy linen hopsack, which was also combined with tulle, produced several lovely cocktail dresses.</p><p>But Mark Badgley and James Mischka (who dressed Kate Winslet for this year's Oscars) are known for gowns, and these were still the focus of the show. An embellished bouquet-print satin-and-chiffon gown was a signature, but it was the dress on Caroline Trentini near the end that stood out for its utter simplicity. Made of black cotton and featuring a large rose corsage at the hip, its only drama came from a trapeze hem. Nothing shown here would shock loyalists. Theirs is a world that hovers at the edge of the fashion universe, where trends take a backseat to heavy-handed glamour.</p></div>"
15,spring,2006,s2006,balenciaga,"Great fashion comes from designers who can fuse two apparently contradictory ideas together to create a synthesis that has never occurred to anyone before. That was the order of experiment—and risk—taken on by Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga. He was aiming, he said, to make something new of “architecture and embellishment, sharpness and ornamentalism.”</p><p>The show condensed Balenciaga past and present, starting with evocations of Cristobal’s cocktail bubbles, creamily rendered in heavy radzimir and embossed silk, and then delivering the surprise—densely elaborated upgrades of Ghesquière’s tailoring and drifty patchwork dresses.</p><p>It was what he called his “baroque rock star” pantsuits that delivered the biggest jolt of surprise. The strict planes of his familiar lean, nipped-waist, long-leg suits are now etched over in dark Wedgwood-like Jacquard patterns, and worn with high-neck frilled shirts. From there, Ghesquière made his way to light-as-air scarf dresses composed of panels of silk print, inserted with lace and cascading frills; glamorous black gowns, intricately worked in lace and chiffon, suspended from bra straps; and cream organza bell-shape dresses weighted with deeply flounced hems.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tem5l""></div></div><p>If all that sounds <em>molto complicato</em>, there was still more compressed into this brisk presentation. Ironically, those were the things of simple, wearable genius—gray knife-pleated kilts, ingeniously seamed in the back and worn with printed, jeweled rock-tour T-shirts—that made for a brilliantly chic take on this season’s college-girl look.</p><p>It all ended up, though, with more baroque and froth: a full Louis XIV fantasy version of the Balenciaga jacket, with extravagant peplums and foppish lace cuffs, and boudoir lingerie paired with droopy bloomers. Those last looks were duds. But when a designer is determined to push creativity to the brink of newness, he’s allowed the odd mistake.</p></div>"
16,spring,2006,s2006,basso-brooke,"Scoop! Who knew that Donatella Versace and John Galliano once eloped to Rio and secretly gave birth to a pair of love twins? They named them Basso &amp; Brooke, and now the boys have exploded into London fashion with a carnival of multicolor, multiprint high campery that flung its astonished audience back in their seats, laughing wildly.</p><p>Well, of course, we made the Don-and-John bit up. But their influence on the collection of Bruno Basso (a Brazilian) and Christopher Brooke (a Brit)—with its exuberant Latin color, theatrically exaggerated silhouettes (vast hats, flounces, and burlesque posturings), and potentially sinister subtext—is nonetheless obvious. Their show opened with a whoosh from a vast Elnett spray—one of the least subtle, yet most hilarious, fashion product placements ever witnessed—and degenerated from there into a highly enjoyable farrago of psychedelic computer-printed fifties prom dresses, hobbled Vegas gowns, and spray-on eighties leggings.</p><p>But take a closer look at all those prints—lipsticks, mirrors, roses, musical notes, and piano keys jazz with chevron stripes and polka dots in a queasy melee of kitsch—and the question begs asking: Just what are these guys getting at? A glance at the program notes explains it: The show, entitled <em>Vanity Affair,</em> is inspired by ""disenchanted housewives … for whom bridge parties and coffee mornings have been superseded by pills and pitchers of cocktails before noon."" Their comment on squiffy narcissism also includes mirror images of women as dogs. Which is not so nice. But there again, the audacious confidence of this show deserves applause. At last, in London, there's something weird on the loose, and it's a long time since we've been able to celebrate that.</p></div>"
17,spring,2006,s2006,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria is a busy man. He recently opened a new Los Angeles boutique, dressed Sharon Stone at Cannes, and sponsored Fashion Rocks. These divergent activities didn't, however, detract from his collection, which was more focused and polished than last season, despite the competition for the designer's attention. Azria has been obsessed with macramé for much of the 00's and he used it again for spring, this time more successfully, on top of soft jersey dresses. Long, vaguely ethnic cotton dresses had macramé details, which added some subtle interest.</p><p>Textural elements, which are building into a bona fide trend, were present at BCBG in gold and wood beading or new applications for canvas, and a flax-embroidered linen jacket worn by Lily Cole worked the trend with finesse. Full silk peasant blouses with twill shorts were well balanced, proportionally. A creamy leather cape topped a long dress, belts chicly cinched curvy coats, and almost everything was worn with snakeskin flats (or adorable distressed-canvas or printed Keds for BCBG). While a striped series and the balloon hems fell flat, the collection as a whole felt more personal, and less forced, than what Azria has done in the past.</p></div>"
18,spring,2006,s2006,behnaz-sarafpour,"Small details that translate into big effects have become Behnaz Sarafpour's stock in trade. For spring, as with her lovely resort collection, that little feature was lace. It appeared as trimming on an orange cloque sheath, as a hand-tatted neckline on a silk shell, and for evening, as a collar that dressed up model Lisa Cant's ribbed tank and tiered evening skirt considerably.</p><p>But this wasn't a one-note show. Polka-dot georgette and animal-print silk livened up the mostly black-and-white palette. The textured chiffon she called ""gingham"" in her program notes made a seen-a-million-of-them drawstring blousy top stand out. And tattoo embroidery turned a simple silk tweed dress into something truly special. As for silhouettes, her cropped double-face wool jackets looked a little boxy and big in the puffed shoulders, but she showed the season's most-elegant shorts, in knee-grazing silk. For after dark, she went long and narrow, as is the trend.</p><p>Sarafpour's followers will remember that last September she showed her collection on the main floor of Tiffany. This time around, she accessorized with chokers, bracelets, and rings from the competition across the street, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels. Perhaps there's a jewelry line in the future for the designer, who clearly knows how to make an outsize statement with the smallest of things.</p></div>"
19,spring,2006,s2006,bill-blass,"""There's a lack of communication between you and me,"" blasted the disco soundtrack at Bill Blass, and perhaps it was a more prescient statement than intended. This disconnect has been a persistent problem for the past few seasons, and creative director Michael Vollbracht has struggled to find a balance between revisiting the rich Blass legacy and establishing his own identity. For spring, Vollbracht took a few forward steps, showing a retail-ready collection of fine proportions (neat bodices over fuller skirts) that was young and fresh, but not so much so as to alienate his more mature customers. What <em>was</em> off-putting were the cutesy runway antics of three blond models who vamped shamelessly for the cameras before swaying back down the catwalk hand-in-hand in Bardot-evoking gingham dresses. It's doubtful that Mr. Blass would have approved.</p></div>"
20,spring,2006,s2006,bottega-veneta,"Tomas Maier has lightened up: There's a spring in the step of his girls and a lot of hair-flicking going on (theirs, not his). The silhouette—nipped at the waist with a wide silver-embellished velvet belt swirling to a flared skirt above antiqued-leather T-strap stilettoes—added to the summery swing of a collection of mixed influences, from the bold strokes of American color-field painting to a luxury-filtered version of Mexicana.</p><p>Maier is a born modernist, interested in function and fanatical about detail, and not the kind of designer to be dogmatic about his look. ""I see all of this as a suggestion,"" he said. ""Because you have to do it in your own way."" The pieces he's producing for Bottega Veneta—tobacco-brown blazers, tawny suede duster coats, and each one of the complex bags—need to be picked up, stroked, and inspected inside and out to be fully appreciated. That makes all the whisking past of Bottega's bags—in lemon velvet, exotic reptile, and tortoise shell, or a variation of the house woven leather in bright flashes of color—a frustrating business. And that's the dilemma.</p><p>Maier isn't working in a run-of-the-mill ready-to-wear house that needs to shout to be heard. The steep upward trajectory of the company's sales figures is attributable to a new, discreet pattern of buying among women who collect precious things in a personal way—not least because they haven't been part of the brash overexposure of regular runway news-making. The value of Bottega Veneta can only be truly expressed in a close-up, tactile presentation. Can Maier invent a better way to do his work justice?</p></div>"
21,spring,2006,s2006,boudicca,"""Please do not touch the artwork,"" read the signs lining the central installation of Brian Kirkby and Zowie Broach's <em>Romantic Museum</em> collection for Boudicca at Bumble and Bumble, which was a talcum-powdered runway. This bookish, London-based team is known for their austere and artful collections, but for their second outing in New York, they displayed a softer side. Military references are a signature of Boudicca, since the line is named after a warrior queen, but overall, the mood was lightened by airy eyelet and floral prints.</p><p>To a clap of soundtrack thunder, Heather Marks opened the show in a black eyelet dress buckled under the bust and covered with tassels. A white glove caught in a harnessed epaulet hung over one shoulder. Body-constricting devices were limited to neck ruffs, wide obi belts, and a slender gold metal circle tied in a blue bow at the back of a waist. Laser-cut leathers kept company with intricately pieced eyelets. A digitally printed rose-pattern damask complemented a floral-print leather that was worked into a skirt and paired with a light-blue puff-sleeve blouse (a neat twist on Victoriana). A black palette was livened up with the layering of a grayish yellow, blue, and metallic ruby red.</p><p>Blame it on the sensitive assemblage artist Joseph Cornell, the designers' inspiration, but the mood was delicate: The finale pieces featured pleated skirts and falls that had a tutu quality. But separates like culottes and a chic pocket-front coat, even the perfect little black dress, were surprisingly accessible and, of course, chic.</p></div>"
22,spring,2006,s2006,brian-reyes,"Not every 24-year-old fledgling gets props from <em>The New York Times</em> <em>prior</em> to his runway debut. But then there's nothing average about Brian Reyes. He's a self-taught designer, who in a very short time has worked (in various roles) at Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Oscar de la Renta. His spring show, for which Eliza Reed Bolen grabbed a front-row seat, proved that the last of those three mentors informed his aesthetic the most. The evidence? A distinct ""lady"" attitude, and a three-dimensional rose-petal-embroidered skirt that had both sass and class.</p><p>""I wanted to tell a beautiful story, to show my love for my craft and my country,"" said Reyes, referring to his parents' homeland, Colombia. From delicate, braided straps on lace-trimmed camisole tops, to a caramel-color skirt constructed entirely of plaits, his love of the craft was apparent. Texture was also abundant, in the form of wood beading, raffia embroidery, silk burlap fabric, and a branch print. All of which tied in well with the safari theme, which was introduced in the second look: a khaki hacking dress. Reyes' clientele isn't likely to hunt for anything more endangered than a last-minute reservation at Per Se, though. He's designing for a woman with less-than-wild tastes. There were godet and pencil skirts for the uptown set, and deeply cuffed trousers and thirties-influenced crinkled-silk-chiffon blouses, paired with shrunken boleros of the same fabric and color (a new take on the twinset), for the occasional dalliance downtown.</p><p>With this collection, if Reyes didn't exactly explore new territory, he certainly aligned himself with a solid tradition. So is he worthy of the hype, and a promising newbie? In the words of Shakira, which blasted through the sound system, ""<em>claro, claro, claro.</em>""</p></div>"
23,spring,2006,s2006,burberry-prorsum,"It's goodbye to Marianne Faithfull, and hello to HRH Princess Margaret. That was how Christopher Bailey deftly swiveled Burberry in a new direction for spring, with less rock and more royalty. ""I wanted to be a bit more refined and grown-up,"" he said. ""So I imagined a young English girl dressing as if she was an old-fashioned deb."" One is now going out in duchesse satin coats and gold brocade trenches rather than Afghan jackets, my dear. And sixties hippie smocks have been replaced by neat little seventies high-belted dresses balanced on patent platforms. It was all a timely bit of posh, but nothing too slavishly retro. Princess Margaret was never seen running round in this sort of knitted hat.</p><p>Burberry is part of Britain's social fabric past and present, and that's what Bailey is playing with so successfully these days. The Margaret angle, lightly referenced, is his clever way of steering the label upscale (there's been a lot in the British press about the populist embrace of the Burberry check recently). It also creates a new proportion—short and A-line, with stacked heels—that's looking increasingly right this season. His choice of color—palest beige, toffee, plaster pink, yellow, and antiqued gold—adds another timely layer of class.</p><p>Rummaging around in the Burberry archive, Bailey recently unearthed early seventies advertising pages shot by the queen's suave photographer cousin, Lord Lichfield. The images inspired updates of the house's evergreen trench—one, gorgeously fitted in caramel iguana, others with caped sleeves. He also trotted out a belt-and-buckle print that now reappears on dresses. All in all, a jolly good show.</p></div>"
24,spring,2006,s2006,c-neeon,"C-Neeon, Clara Kraetsch and Doreen Schulz's new art-based label out of Berlin, was the winner of the 2005 Hyères Festival, a prestigious Europe-wide young-designer competition. What they showed charmed and impressed the judges with the energy and integrity of its twenty-first century adherence to Bauhaus design principles—all bright hand-blocked prints and graphic shapes reimagined for today's street and club generation.</p><p>This season, C-Neeon accepted an invitation to present in London, a platform that, if not exactly rivaling the full klieg-lit fashion exposure of the Paris runway, at least provides a second-tier transitional space to set young designers on their way. Their collection—mostly asymmetric tops with block-colored and diagonally striped panels over roller-printed leggings and jeans—channeled the aesthetic of early German modernism without looking like an art history thesis. Taken apart, the T-shirtdresses, leggings, and hooded sweatshirts, stamped with bold teal, red, black, and cream graphics looked like commercial propositions. That's what London's Topshop, Britain's biggest youth retailer thinks, anyway. The company commissioned C-Neeon to design a mini-line.</p></div>"
25,spring,2006,s2006,calvin-klein-collection,"The air-conditioning was on the fritz late Thursday afternoon at Milk Studios, and as the Calvin Klein audience wilted in the bleachers, some wondered aloud why the poor conditions persisted. After all, this wasn't a cash-strapped fashion upstart that people had come out for, but an iconic American brand owned by a multibillion-dollar company. Many resorted to fanning themselves with their program notes, which offered some relief, but not enough. It's too bad, because Francisco Costa, now in his sixth season at Calvin, turned out one of his strongest, and coolest, collections to date.</p><p>Circles and, to a lesser extent, the sixties were his themes, made evident in Empire-waist dresses with tiny dots and oversize, geometric designs silk-screened onto A-line shifts. He even offered his own minimalist take on one of the season's big trends, ruffles, by stringing circles together and stitching them at their centers to the hem of a cocktail number. Pleating on cotton voile, georgette, and chiffon (Note to stylist: Lose the skimpy panties) was another recurring motif. But it wasn't all about wovens. He reclaimed the cable knit from the bookish set, and draped jersey into a couple of soft day dresses. These last two looks were most reminiscent of the old Calvin. Now that Costa is developing his fresh, new signatures, maybe it's time for a fresh, new venue.</p></div>"
26,spring,2006,s2006,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera's program notes promised a trip to early twentieth-century Vienna, but there was nothing archaic about her pretty new collection. Forgoing the skirtsuits that have made her a favorite of the ladies' lunch set, she teamed leg-elongating trousers with tiny knit sweaters over trim button-downs, and a ribbon-waisted pencil-slim skirt with a short-sleeve blouse in a naïf radish print. It all looked very fresh, but perhaps not as youthful as one might've expected, given that the paparazzi's favorite junior Park Avenue target, Lauren Davis, is ensconced in the designer's public relations department.[</p><p>When the spring social season kicks off, Davis and her crowd will be snapped in Herrera's shapely, floor-grazing skirts, fitted to the knee and flaring out in a cascade of ruffles. These appeared in silk gazar and embroidered cotton. If the designer's most recent collection was stripped of embellishments, her new lineup made up for lost time and had them in abundance. More Arts and Crafts than high glam, hand-painted floral appliqués, raffia belts over chiffon gowns, and exquisite embroidery that gave one thyme cotton column the look of brocade were all clever flourishes. It's too bad these confections weren't shown with a younger shoe, perhaps a flat. But devoted fans of her evening dresses won't be dissuaded by such a minor detail and can go elsewhere for that.</p></div>"
27,spring,2006,s2006,catherine-malandrino,"To get <em>Down to Earth</em> for her spring show, Catherine Malandrino had 36 models climb onto concrete pedestals at the Pace Wildenstein gallery. That wasn't the only paradox in the show's theme and title; on view were pieces from the designer's limited edition line, Malandrino, a jump up in price from her other signature collection.</p><p>Her two primary influences, Amish craftsmanship and West African colors, were combined with varying degrees of success. Dresses won out as the strongest pieces, providing a great opportunity to show off both the handiwork, like lace and quilting, and textural fabrics. Liu Dan wore a patchwork dress that was a medley of diamond-shaped pieces of indigo fabric. Atong wore a dress of lace cedar circles that widened in diameter from the bodice down to its orange ribbon-trimmed hem. A woodsy print on cotton voile, with wood bead detailing at the bust line, had a full skirt, and a cotton Jacquard version shot through with silver leaves had an appealing openwork bodice.</p><p>Separates, however, were a little trickier. A laser-cut leather cardigan was on target, but bib-front shirts with insets seemed fussy. Coats, both the trenches and pea coats, looked bulky. Flag-print ballet flats, which Malandrino is making in collaboration with Repetto, were eye-catching. And her eponymous shoe line, mainly crocheted designs with wooden heels, had its debut during the show.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zcq2wk""></div></div><p>Overall, it was a departure for a designer who is known for petal-pretty, flowing pieces. While the clothes were well made, the effect could be precious and artsy-craftsy, and maybe not as grounded as the designer intended.</p></div>"
28,spring,2006,s2006,celine,"Ivana Omazic, an unknown 32-year-old Croatian, is the latest designer charged with figuring out a raison d'être for Celine's presence on the Paris runway. Admittedly, it's a tricky task. In very recent memory, Michael Kors, with his humor and bounce, has passed through this way, followed by Roberto Menichetti, with his abstruse modernism. So this third debut needed to give a strong directive about just how an internationally resonant fashion collection could be constructed around a name that, back in the day, was mostly known as a conservative French lady's source of handbags and everyday separates.</p><p>Omazic said she is inspired by that tradition. So what on earth was the audience supposed to think about the hot-orange dress, mohair crochet cardigan, and red floppy hat, worn with red kneesocks and high-heel sandals, that announced the opening of this show? (What to make, for that matter, of the fiery ball of Mars that was rotating at the end of the runway?) As far as could be detected, the ""tradition"" came later, in the canvas and tan leather-trimmed bags, the chain belts that circled cardigans, the cropped riding boots, and the box-pleated A-line skirts, some of which came with a chain detail slung below the waistband, center front.</p><p>But if that's where the message lay, it was comprehensively drowned in a showing that included too much black, an overabundance of cut-out swimwear, and what seemed like endless reiterations of the tight-bodice, full-skirt dress that opened the show. Quite possibly, taken apart and seen on a rail, this collection will look far more attractive. But styled and presented like this, it just didn't work.</p></div>"
29,spring,2006,s2006,chaiken,"With paint company Benjamin Moore as a sponsor, Chaiken had the audience expecting a bold show of color. While there were shots of orange, lilac, and buttercup yellow, creative director Jeff Mahshie kept with the season's burgeoning minimalist streak and focused primarily on form and shape.</p><p>Most of the collection's full-skirt frocks (shirtdresses for day; strapless in a crinkly metallic cotton for evening) appeared in white, black, cream, and navy, and many were finished off with rope belts and obi sashes. Of course, Julie Chaiken built the label on its smartly cut pants, and there were plenty of those, too. Some had raised waists, and nearly all with full legs. They looked great with a simple top and a cropped vest, another one of spring's ubiquitous pieces.</p></div>"
30,spring,2006,s2006,chalayan,"Short, sexy, and body-conscious—you would imagine the intellectual Hussein Chalayan would rather die than have those three adjectives attached to his clothes. Yet they are the only words to describe his latest collection, from the scrolled curves of the white skirtsuit that opened the show to the multistrap bra-topped dresses that ended it.</p><p>Cleaned-up and pared-down are two of the emerging buzz phrases of the season, and Chalayan's radar has clearly tuned in to that frequency. But his intelligence has also locked on to the fact that today's minimalism can't be a rehash of the nineties. Instead, he's working out a curvilinear, sculptural, sometimes 3-D alternative, one that happens to make an excellent foil for a great body.</p><p>A white cut-out dress, bare at the waist and embroidered and embossed with vine leaves, was one example. Others were the dresses that suspended scarflike prints from heavy-duty black bras. Something in all this triggered memories of early Versace—a source many young designers are beginning to ransack in London, where Chalayan lives. That burst of inspiration has put him on a new track and, apparently, in a new, lightened-up mood. At the end of his show, he kindly provided anyone worried about where these clothes would be worn with a visual clue: a short blue dress with nightclub ropes bound into it.</p></div>"
31,spring,2006,s2006,chanel,"The audience at Chanel's spring presentation was greeted by the sight of a gargantuan computer screen and keyboard, placed at the end of the runway. It seemed like the one unifying symbol of everything Karl Lagerfeld sent out in the collection: all the high-speed information about every trend of the season, communicated directly onto a computer screen in real time. Faster than even Style.com can report it.</p><p>It was as if the ever-restless Lagerfeld, sitting in his studio at the Rue Cambon, had designed while continually hitting the refresh button on his vision of the global domain of the eternal ""CC."" What should the new Chanel jacket look like for spring '06? Tight and neat, and worn with Bermudas. What's the news on the dress? Nude chiffon, banded in black. There's a printy, scarfy feeling out there: Bring on a few billowy Art Deco blouses. Nail ""schoolgirl"" in a tweed jumper. Check off crunchy lace with a sweet white A-line T-shirt and skirt. Compress puffed sleeves and boleros into a cropped taffeta jacket. Salute ""folkloric"" with a Spanish-pattern black-and-white sweater and a flounced skirt. And as for the chain belt? No problem—Chanel owns it!</p><p>Part of the point of this is that Lagerfeld's febrile capacity for instant-uptake fashion can fill a football pitch—and yet still all look like Chanel. In reality, fashion is now more about the availability of a gazillion simultaneous choices rather than the single, old-school designer diktat. With this collection, Lagerfeld broke the taboo on saying that out loud—while also proving that a strong brand, strongly directed, can surf any trend without losing its identity. Does that mean Chanel has resigned itself to adapting to the culture of fast-fashion disposability, though? Oh, not at all. The fifties circle skirt and poufy taffeta dresses at the end of the show were pretty time-transcenders that might live in any girl's wardrobe for decades to come.</p></div>"
32,spring,2006,s2006,chloe,"Phoebe's back, and you can tell. Returning after a season's maternity leave, Philo sent out a collection that put a crisp new shape, proportion, and vigor into Chloé's step. ""I just wanted to do volume; something new,"" she said of the pristine A-line shapes and stiffer couture fabrics she used to replace the drifty layers that launched a gazillion copies last year. Now Chloé has a fresh look: It flares from the shoulder, stops above the knee, and swings leggily along on great chunky platforms.</p><p>White dresses, derived from looking at sixties ruffled shirts, were intricately worked in crunchy embroidery, organza appliqués, and frills. Immaculate as confirmation outfits, they breezed airily through the trends: a baroque pattern on a smock; table-linen cutwork curlicues on a ruffled-shoulder A-line dress. To counterpoint that, Philo introduced a new structure for her tailoring, cutting neatly fitted, pressed-linen sixties coats, and stiff little cropped jackets.</p><p>All this came about, she said, from her research into 1960's ""old-lady chic."" By the time she finished with it, of course, the ""old"" had thoroughly evaporated: This was a vision that will speak directly to Philo's generation of young women. One clear hint of the inspiration remained, though: the in-joke names with which she christened the new Chloé bags. There was Marge, the little snake evening purse on a silver chain; Edith, the conker-color washed-leather bag; and Gladys, the zip-laden tote. And for her own bow on the runway, Phoebe was wearing the other key accessory for spring: Lilian, the striped elastic belt.</p></div>"
33,spring,2006,s2006,christian-dior,"The setting and the preliminaries were more akin to a triumphal French state occasion than a fashion show, as a veritable who's who of Parisian society, gasping and gossiping, filed in to get their first look at the soaring nineteenth-century glass-and-steel splendor of the newly renovated Grand Palais. In a way, they had gathered there for a ritual steeped in a sense of national pride: the Christian Dior spring collection, an event garlanded with the kind of pomp and power only the French can bestow upon the business of fashion.</p><p>Was that why John Galliano was on his best behavior? No silly pranks, breakneck platforms, scary makeup, or crazy, colliding references this season. Instead, what he proposed was a businesslike program for maximizing the potential of a single idea in his last couture collection: the black-lace-over-nude dress that Kate Moss wore this summer to the CFDA Awards.</p><p>That one idea spun out through short dresses, drapier than the corseted original, and then in every possible garment and fabric treatment, from jackets and coats to jeans and, finally, a bustier bikini. Having wrung the last possible drop of inspiration out of the lace, Galliano moved on to big, bubbly organza blouses and to playing about with rainbows of degraded pinks—nude to fuchsia or nude to orange—to tinge the hems of short dresses and airy gowns and vary the monotony of all that flesh-colored floatiness.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vyr27a""></div></div><p>But of course, there was another unmissable footnote to this thoroughly commercial plan. That, of course, is the competition-whacking Dior saddle bag—now displaying a softness that cleverly demonstrates its ability to adapt to fashion's every twist and turn.</p></div>"
34,spring,2006,s2006,christian-lacroix,"There are some designers who torture themselves to produce their best work, some whose ideas flare defiantly under pressure, and some whose brilliance can only flourish when they are set free from angst. Christian Lacroix belongs to the last category: a creator motivated by happiness. That emotion—painted in a fantastic kaleidoscope of color and sketched with a real idea of how a great summer ought to feel to a girl—came through in every outfit that trod blissfully along the bright yellow sand of his runway.</p><p>In a season of print and femininity, Lacroix put together one of the most ravishingly individual looks to be found anywhere. Hair tied up in printed headscarves, his girls wore flowered dresses with contrasting slubby coats or jackets slung on top. They walked lightly, in Hessian ballet shoes, swinging straw bags, each decorated with a big satin bow with a chunk of diamanté in the center. And within that template, he found ways to play out all the experience of his nearly 20 years as a couturier: his taste for Spanish boleros, corseted bustiers, eighteenth-century brocades, bold African prints, flowing painterly chiffons.</p><p>All that fantasy and skill has been tantalizingly glimpsed in his haute couture collections, season after season. Sometimes it's come off as stiff, sometimes weird and out of joint with the times. But with this collection, his second ready-to-wear under new management, Lacroix has finally realized his full potential—in ways guaranteed to charm every girl who chances across it.</p></div>"
35,spring,2006,s2006,clements-ribeiro,"When manufacturing problems hit them this summer after they lost their licensee, Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro scarcely missed a beat. For spring, they regrouped, all kinds of friends rallied round, and with a lot of goodwill and determination, they got their show on the road again in two weeks flat. ""In a way, we've gone full circle, back to where we started,"" said Clements. ""I actually enjoyed the fact that we had to pare down and concentrate on 19 looks.""</p><p>Any coincidence that there were circle motifs on their signature cashmere sweaters? The couple didn't say, but their cute, crisp summer wardrobe of printed cotton coats, A-line tops, shorts, and easy, pull-on dresses betrayed no signs of the stress of the past few months. They took a folksy woodcut print from their home, applied it to coats and bags, and played with stripes (another C.R.-ism) on luxurious football sweaters, cleverly pieced clamdiggers, and neat dresses. With the playful addition of vinyl-and-rubber cut-out flowers clustered on floppy hats, appliquéd to dresses, or made into necklaces, the collection indeed recaptured the charm of their earliest shows.</p><p>The difference now is that Clements Ribeiro has evolved into a brand proposition, complete with great shoes and bags. All the designers need is an investor inspired enough to see how those elements can be leveraged into an interesting business. And if it means that the ready-to-wear stays small and the accessories go major, maybe that's the route forward they needed to take all along.</p></div>"
36,spring,2006,s2006,comme-des-garcons,"Usually you count on a Comme des Garçons show to plumb mysterious depths, but for spring, the mystery was slap-bang there on the surface. It looked like nothing so much as an homage to Vivienne Westwood's royal collections. Ringletted girls in crowns, wearing Union Jack-printed underwear and punkish tartans, proceeded up and down the runway to the strains of Coronation marches, Church of England hymns, and even, gorblimey, ""Land of Hope and Glory."" It was all—and this was the shock in this house of intellectual subtlety—puzzlingly literal. But why?</p><p>Backstage, Rei Kawakubo shook her head and denied that the collection was about England, or Japanese tourist souvenirs of Britishness, or a romantic gesture of support for a city that has been subjected to bombings and in which she has her Dover Street shopping complex. She conceded that there were references to ""a lost Empire,"" but more importantly, she said, it was about ""cutting without a pattern."" All the pieces had been draped on the dress stand, creating whorls of tartan bunched around shoulder lines of jackets, wrappings of tulle that read as bulbous approximations of boleros, and bunchy skirts, swagged and ruched at the sides.</p><p>Some of it triggered recollections of Kawakubo's infamous ""lumps and bumps"" collection from the late eighties. But where those earlier clothes provoked the most adverse audience reaction of Kawakubo's career, these outfits didn't have it in them to cause offense. Instead, they were just plain difficult to fathom. It's odd to see Rei Kawakubo do anything on the mild side; then again, perhaps it's refreshing to discover that even geniuses have their off seasons.</p></div>"
37,spring,2006,s2006,costello-tagliapietra,"For spring, Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra produced a striking collection of their signature draped jersey dresses, which earned them a <em>Vogue</em>/CFDA Fashion Fund nomination this year, and much more. The invitation to the show offered clues as to what was to come; it featured a blurred detail of Pre-Raphaelite painter J.W. Waterhouse's <em>Psyche Entering Cupid's Garden,</em> a soft yet confident assertion of femininity.</p><p>With quiet assuredness, the duo introduced crinkled silks, crepes, and georgettes into their typically all-jersey world and showed a greater variety of separates. Shawl- and draped-collar jackets, some with contrasting Petersham ribbon trim, were paired with slim trousers with slot seams and pleated skirts. All of it was handled with their typical skill, but as welcome as these additions were, the dresses and gowns were still the standouts. Pale ""watercolors,"" painterly shades of clay, beige, gray-green, bone, yellow, and lavender, unified the collection. Individual detailing was what set them apart, like shirring at the shoulder bone, a bow tied at the back, a keyhole slit, or a cinch. The gowns left as much of an impression going as they did coming, since each one had rich detail in the back. The most dramatic of the lot had ribbon straps that plunged into a V and met a petal of fabric at the waist.</p><p>What was most remarkable about the show was that it escaped both the Grecian undertones typically attached to draped jersey pieces and the overt references to Jean Muir or Madame Grès. Instead of floating like deities, the models swished by with the assurance of mortal goddesses in the twenty-first century.</p></div>"
38,spring,2006,s2006,costume-national,"Ennio Capasa cited the heroines of Michelangelo Antonioni's movies as influences for spring. But on the evidence of the clothes, he was thinking more early sixties <em>La Notte</em> than mid-decade <em>Blow-up</em>. The one exception was a navy Empire-line minidress, its neckline and straps trimmed in royal-blue crystals, which seemed tossed in at the last minute as a nod to fashion's new direction.</p><p>Capasa was at his best when he focused on the waist, cinching it with wide raffia belts or showcasing it with a strictly corseted jacket. Slick tailoring is his strong suit; superfluous details like a row of buttons across the shoulder blades of a suede trench distracted from his collection's impact. And though embellishments like a jeweled shoulder clip or a bodice of swirling rhinestones gave his evening looks a luxe touch, the gowns would have looked just as sexy—and more modern—without them.</p><p>After a quiet beginning, the show finished with jarring colors like chartreuse, candy apple red, and kelly green that didn't jibe with the otherwise-subtle pleated and ruched cocktail dresses. Like Antonioni's films, the graphic designs that Capasa is known for are plenty powerful in black and white.</p></div>"
39,spring,2006,s2006,d-g,"Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana were in an airy, loved-up kind of mood as they began their 20th-anniversary celebrations with a lacy all-white D&amp;G collection. Their general drift: <em>Emmanuelle</em> seen through a soft-focus Sarah Moon-ish lens, but designed for a teenager's long night out at an Italian seaside disco.</p><p>Dolce and Gabbana have been around long enough to be designing for the daughters of their first late-eighties customers. They tackle the job with a cheerful recognition that most of their fashion references will float straight over the heads of their new audience. ""Young people never have too much knowledge of the past, so we mixed the old with the hyper-new,"" said Dolce. What appeared wasn't really an essay on late-seventies film and photography, but more a roundup of current Mediterranean notions about pretty-yet-sexy dressing. Long, short, Empire line, Victorian, broderie anglaise, organza, stretch lace, and flounces, mixed up with pedal pushers and shorts—they had it all covered. Except for the fact that 80 percent of it, of course, was see-through.</p></div>"
40,spring,2006,s2006,derek-lam,"""Paradise lost."" That's how Derek Lam described the Hawaii of John Severson's midcentury surf photographs, and the inspiration behind his spring collection. The silhouettes—A-line, above-the-knee, puff sleeves—certainly recalled the sixties, as did his palette of mostly khaki, black, and white. As for beachy accents, the two-time CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist accessorized with fabric leis, sand dollars on leather straps, and silk scarves cinched below the chin.</p><p>As retro as it sounds, what made the collection right for modern-day city dwellers was its ease. Sure, a pencil skirt is sexy, but a paper-bag-waist skirt made from cotton voile eyelet is irresistibly weightless. In which one would you rather walk a mile? Lam's Empire-waist gowns in crinkle chiffon seemed to float down the runway, a counterpoint in a season when many designers have gone heavy on the ornamentation, especially for night. If a complaint can be made, it's that a lot of what he showed looked rather young for the prices they will command.</p></div>"
41,spring,2006,s2006,diane-von-furstenberg,"Seconds before Diane von Furstenberg would have come out for her bow, with the models taking their final lap around her crowded West 12th Street studio and show space, a rack of stage lights fell from the ceiling. <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>'s Hilary Alexander was hurt, as were several other editors and publicists, and many in the audience were badly shaken. The accident put a frightening stop to what was a strong outing for the designer.</p><p>In her program notes, von Furstenberg said she was inspired by Rome, but the collection looked more like a tour through her own glamorous closets, if she had archived everything from her three decades in the international spotlight. First out was a cotton shirtdress in an oversize twig design. The black-and-white print was one of many bold botanicals, palm trees and giant kelp included. There wasn't a shrinking violet in sight. Wrap dresses came in solid, slinky jerseys perfectly suited for a twirl at Studio 54, while floor-length evening gowns were generously beaded. There was plenty of sportswear—bermudas, full Bianca trousers, and slim skirts—in the mix. Among the many jackets, a denim style with topstitching looked fresh. But if you want glam, Diane did that too, in the form of several smart little toppers in Lurex.</p></div>"
42,spring,2006,s2006,dkny,"Donna Karan switched gears for spring. The tiered peasant skirts are gone, the beading, too, has disappeared. Yes, there was some embellishment in the form of bows, but her DKNY collection—like her signature line—was mostly about volume and proportion play. What a fitting location, then, the large glass lobby of the Lever House turned out to be.</p><p>Skirts came tulip shaped, while Empire-line dresses—in wallpaper florals or the season's requisite eyelet, in silver here—flared out from high waists. Pleating, too, was a recurring motif; it looked especially sweet on a lemon-yellow chiffon frock, but white and black belted shirt versions will surely become a wardrobe staple. Speaking of which, a classic trench looked sturdy in a dark khaki, but decidedly not standard issue.</p></div>"
43,spring,2006,s2006,dolce-gabbana,"A pouting bevy of bosomy senorinas, squeezed into red lace and gingham corsetry, is rising out of the floor into a Sicilian barn as a lonely farmhand looks on, trying to restrain his goats. This was the romantic-gone-utterly-kitsch keynote for Dolce &amp; Gabbana's triumphal 20th-anniversary celebration: one big outrageous roll in the hay with the boys, for old time's sake.</p><p>With straw stuck in their hair, the girls worked their way through endless costume changes on the themes of frilly red, white, and black eyelet and not-so-innocent country-girl gingham. Shapes ran riot with the duo's standard push-up lingerie engineering—bursting out into big petticoated fifties skirts and teetering vertiginously on their signature wedges and platforms. Meanwhile, lest we lose the plot, the story was heavily embroidered with poppy and wheat field embellishments.</p><p>In European culture, the wheat ear is a talisman auguring good fortune. Well, it's worked for Dolce and Gabbana. Strolling hand in hand along the runway in the former Metropol theater they've just bought, surrounded by a crush of models in vast operatic crinolines, they looked like they were inwardly shouting, ""We did it!"" It's a long way from the rented walkup in which they cut and sewed their first collection in 1985, so they deserve their one-night binge of triumph. As for the collection? It was less a retrospective than the theatrical opener for a big party. A pity they forgot to showcase their signature sharp tailoring and white shirts in the frilly melee, but never mind this one time. Pop open the Champagne for the boys.</p></div>"
44,spring,2006,s2006,donna-karan,"Donna Karan looked to New York's Museum of Modern Art for inspiration for her spring collection. There was Jackson Pollock and Paul Klee in the graffiti prints and abstract graphics that decorated her dresses, jackets, and coats. As literal as Yves Saint Laurent's 1965 Mondrian shifts, they carried a big, visual punch, but they weren't the show's most-powerful pieces.</p><p>That distinction would be reserved for what Karan described in her run of show as freefall back dresses. Gathered by a sash in front that passed between the middle back and the fabric, they tented out behind the models as they glided around the runway. Silhouettes for both day and evening were generally full, although she did show a few strict pencil skirts, as well as fitted, cropped pants.</p><p>Two sequined gowns near the end of the show seemed out of place, mostly for their predictability. A third, with a creamy white illusion neckline and a navy body, looked too familiar. An inventive, fluid way with draping is what Karan's audience has come to expect and appreciate.</p></div>"
45,spring,2006,s2006,doo-ri,"Before her show, Doo-Ri Chung promised to continue the tradition of hard edges and tailoring that she began with her collection for fall. Some especially successful examples of this were khaki cotton trenches, one with a stand-up collar and the other with a cascade of ruffles that descended to a belted waist. Pants in the same material were mostly of the wide-leg variety that's become popular this season, while skirts were knee length and pencil slim. Either would look great with the cognac cropped leather jacket that added a welcome dose of spice to the mostly nude- and blush-colored collection.</p><p>Chung built her name on architecturally draped jersey dresses, and she did just one for spring, embroidering the torso with an extravagant array of Swarovski crystals. But mostly, she traded in her flowing knits for silks and satins. Cocktail length or to the floor, they looked luxurious (and expensive), especially when they came with net overlays attached by swirls of rhinestones. But despite her best efforts, they just didn't have the same swing of her jersey numbers. Backstage, she said her gossamer creations brought to mind ""pissed-off fairies."" Apparently, they weren't angry enough, and it all could have benefited from a bit more attitude.</p></div>"
46,spring,2006,s2006,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten shed a lovely sidelight on how to wear summer's crumply, crinkly, biscuity-beige duster coats, shorts, and loose dresses. By showing them with pale powdered faces, red lipstick, and high heels, he nicely circumnavigated the potential pitfalls of fabrics that, carelessly thrown on, can end up having all the mystique of potato sacks.</p><p>Full marks for bringing a kind of gentle glamour to his opening passage, then. But Van Noten's ever-widening constituency is not in search of a punchily obvious trend. What pleases his followers is seeing him just keepin' on being Dries, season in, season out. That always involves some ethnic touches and lots of arts-and-crafts textures, made in shapes calculated to frame a personality rather than flash a hot bod. This collection serviced all those needs, with an excursion into Asian-influenced kimono fabrics, tie-dye, and flower prints, all sparked up for the season with some metallic brocades. The designer's obi-like wraps, bound around small jackets, might have signaled a nod to the current feeling for the cinched waist, but it was done entirely within his own frame of reference. And since Van Noten's fans are conscious avoiders of clothes that scream ""fashion,"" this was a collection calculated to speak to his customers as successfully as ever.</p></div>"
47,spring,2006,s2006,dsquared,"The dirt runway scattered with sprigs of straw was a giveaway; those antic Canadian twins Dean and Dan Caten were throwing a barn dance—or, as they dubbed it, ""a hee-haw hoedown."" Their Dsquared² set's theatrical crimson curtains opened on a way-out West homestead, complete with hay barn, windmill, and an understandably skittish gray mare and her foal. Those Caten boys sure don't do subtle.</p><p>Their playful spaghetti Western, set to a rousing soundtrack that included a remix of Malcolm McLaren's 1981 single ""Buffalo Gals"" and twangy cowboy movie and TV themes, featured a cast of feisty, gun-totin' girls and frisky ranch hands. Witty ideas included flounced turn-of-the-century skirts in denim or <em>'bacca</em>-color suede, denim dungaree-bibbed jodhpurs, horseshoe belts, and flirty dresses with a forties flavor (there was even an off-the-shoulder siren gown) appliquéd with rodeo-shirt detailing.</p><p>Chaps, aprons, and cummerbund belts were elaborately chased with saddlery-work details, while fringed suede jackets and gilets were decorated in imitation Native American beadwork. Of course, the Caten <em>frères</em> haven't neglected commerce; those OTT chaps flapped over pencil-leg jeans, and adorable shrunken denim jackets were worn with the trailing Aunt Eller skirts and granddad shirts. Finishing touches included those narrow black ribbon neckties so beloved of spaghetti Western costumiers.</p></div>"
48,spring,2006,s2006,elie-saab,"Fresh off two big hits at the Emmys last month—Marcia Cross and Debra Messing both chose gowns from his July haute couture show—Elie Saab presented his ready-to-wear collection this morning in Paris for the first time. While the 73-look extravaganza needed editing, it had the makings of success; you could easily picture his celebrity clients wearing one of the white raw-silk skirtsuits to a Beverly Hills benefit lunch. And some of his black cocktail dresses—a drop-waist pleated chiffon number comes to mind—would flatter a young starlet on the premiere circuit.</p><p>If bling is retreating on most other runways, though, the Beirut-based Saab seems not to have got that memo. For non-red-carpet nights, he kept the silhouette narrow and the embellishments to a minimum—as in a red floral-print chiffon column dress. But elsewhere, with Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe as inspirations, he liberally sequined hourglass gowns, embroidered pearls onto the hems of others, and trimmed a few in feathers—all flashbulb-friendly, to say the least. With his ready-to-wear operation now in its sixth year, Saab is talking about opening a store in Paris, but the place he ought to be is Southern California.</p></div>"
49,spring,2006,s2006,emanuel-ungaro,"Vincent Darré's second go-around at Emanuel Ungaro was, in at least a couple of ways, more successful than his first. He settled on the house's opulent eighties phase as a source of inspiration, rather than knocking about its deep and varied archive. And once set on that trajectory, he thankfully forwent some of the decade's most garish moments—goodbye, last season's jarring prints and kimono detailing.</p><p>That's not to say things were subdued. Quiet, after all, was never Ungaro's style. Ruffles, bustiers, and poufy shapes abounded. And though Darré's palette included soft, silvery pastels, it was teal, saffron, and fuchsia that predominated, sometimes in abstract florals and geometric prints. He opened with bare halter shapes and finished with even-sparer bras and girdles, interspersed with brief cuffed shorts. It's not clear where the majority of these clothes would be appropriate, beyond the beaches and nightclubs of St. Bart's.</p><p>The real trouble is that the eighties are simply not where fashion's at. The audience would have welcomed a more personal statement from Darré, who has had successes at both Moschino and Fendi. But it's not clear that he's the man to make Ungaro's aesthetic relevant for today.</p></div>"
50,spring,2006,s2006,emilio-pucci,"With each new season chez Emilio Pucci, Christian Lacroix has simplified and streamlined the collection, while his own-name couture presentations hit ever greater heights of giddy exuberance. In this, his last collection for the house, Lacroix dressed his models, with their clean, scrubbed makeup and their ponytails simply tied with bandanas, to reflect the spirit of easy summer resort elegance that Pucci has exemplified since the fifties. ""Pretty is the right word for it,"" said Laudomia Pucci backstage of Lacroix's thistledown work for the label that bears her father's name.</p><p>Lacroix opened the show with a simple shift dress in white cotton drill that tapped into the season's feel for 1960's minimalist rigor with a couture flavor. However, closer inspection revealed that the dress was lavishly embroidered in tone-on-tone faceted china beads, in one of the swirling Op Art formations that are a house signature. That little dress reappeared in vibrant prints in the evocative color mix of purple, teal, azure, and white—Pucci's Vivara palette—that dominated the show.</p><p>To reinforce the breezy mood of the collection, Lacroix added matelot-stripe sleeves or backs to Pucci-print knits—perfect for a yachting adventure in Capri or Portofino—and cut-out swimsuit tops to sleek evening dresses. Bucket ""beach bags"" in white or gold textured leather and gladiator sandals (either flat or kitten-heel) were embroidered in sparkling nail heads and beads for day-into-evening glamour. Similarly fanciful beach-to-gala conceits included a beaded <em>eau de nil</em> chiffon cover-up, a diaphanous, strapless evening dress slashed to reveal a matching bikini bottom, and a sweeping caftan that Elizabeth Taylor might have worn in the campy sixties classic <em>Boom</em>.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hlod6i""></div></div><p>Lacroix's deft couture hand revealed itself in the sunray-pleated gowns spliced in the colors of the season, and a brace of goddess-pleated dresses fashioned for red carpets from Hollywood to Cannes.</p></div>"
51,spring,2006,s2006,emporio-armani,"In recent years, we've come to understand Italian secondary lines as collections with clear focuses of their own. That's the confusion in this Emporio Armani spring show—the sheer volume of details and options on the runway got in the way of any connecting line of thought.</p><p>It started with little black-and-white jackets, shown with sheer skirts worn over knee shorts. From there, it was onto soft crepe skirtsuits with flyaway satin frills, then ruffle-edged cropped pants, followed by striped T-shirts and taffeta sailor trousers. After these came various short, leather and suede jackets, some in pastels with satin ribbon binding and pouch-pocket pants, and then a sudden riff on accordion-pleated wrapped skirts. The effect—before the bugle-beaded eveningwear began to appear—was of a bemusingly random selection from what is obviously a huge commercial line. It's a pity that it distracted from the legendary strength of Giorgio Armani's rigorous, minimalist hand. If he stripped back on detail, allowed the bones of his classics to shine—and showed less—it would give his presentation far greater impact.</p></div>"
52,spring,2006,s2006,etro,"Veronica Etro described her collection as ""a journey of light and color."" That meant exploring a century of painterly treatments, from the exquisitely realistic nineteenth-century Greco-Roman fantasias of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema to the shimmering, abstract color blocks of Mark Rothko (prettily interpreted in skinny knits or hand-painted chiffon evening gowns).</p><p>Etro built up slowly to the highly colored, multiprint effects that have lately become a signature of the house once famed for its autumnal paisley designs. The show opened with a natural linen coat, its hem massed with impasto embroidery that evoked Matisse cutouts. This was typical of the collection's artisanal hand detailing, which included rococo volutes of silvery sequins on a wispy chiffon skirt and jet-embroidered whorls garlanding skirts or coats. Only the accessories were simple and relatively unembellished—high, strappy suede sandals, and bucket bags and briefcases in natural or earthy red linen bordered and bound in black leather.</p><p>Those signature paisleys were subtly revisited—barely perceptible this time—in soft shades of pale yellow for a sunray-pleated evening dress. Meanwhile, the Romany gypsy-scarf prints allowed Etro to run riot with audacious color mixes such as purple, aqua, and cocoa, while a full-blown rose print on a thirties-inspired evening dress captured the season's passion for romantic florals.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""n3kmri""></div></div><p>Etro's eclectic vision also embraced the blues of the Mediterranean Sea, from soft aqua to ultramarine. And the sultry atmosphere that sea evokes was reinforced by evening gowns that suggested Alma-Tadema's ersatz Victorian take on the garb of ancient Greek and Roman lovelies.</p></div>"
53,spring,2006,s2006,fashion-east,"Buyers and press who made the effort to struggle across London for Fashion East ended up feeling very smug with themselves. The tenth installment of this initiative (it selects two or three young designers to show per season) turned up gold.</p><p>Marios Schwab, a 26-year-old half-Greek, half-Austrian designer came out with the freshest surprise of the London shows: a collection that was not only precociously well made, but also stamped with an authentic viewpoint. ""It was about growing up in Athens,"" Schwab said. ""About being young and wild."" For him, believe it or not, that means the early nineties, and his collection went there with short, bra-topped jersey dresses implanted with silver metal cutouts and suspended on complex straps. The spirit—a frank homage to Alaïa, with a touch of Versace thrown in—looked nevertheless like the work of a young perfectionist with an eye of his own. Maria Luisa Poumaillou, of the influential Paris boutique Maria Luisa, left raving.</p><p>If Schwab was a hard act to follow, the cropped mannish tailoring and geometrically pieced dresses of Spijkers en Spijkers, identical twin Dutch designers, showed enough polish to make the audience pay attention. Their contribution was another encouraging sign of the confident mix of European ideas that are now incubating in London. It was followed by a dose of old-school London theatrics from Gareth Pugh, a recent Central Saint Martins graduate. All one needs to know is that it involved faces covered in pink gelatinous masks, red nylon skirts buoyed up by balloons, flesh-color latex boots, and a stiffly sculpted coat-cum-art-piece that lit up in the dark. And most of it worn by transvestites. Clearly an Alexander McQueen wannabe and certainly not everyone's cup of tea, Pugh provided the second moment of the evening that felt like the optimistic early nineties all over again.</p></div>"
54,spring,2006,s2006,fashion-fringe,"In its second year, the Fashion Fringe competition, organized by veteran <em>Sunday Times</em> journalist Colin McDowell, garnered some serious entries. From hundreds of applicants, four (who had to present business plans as well as samples and sketches to qualify) made it to the runway.</p><p>As the show began, it became immediately apparent that two collections would be slugging it out for the prize. Modernist, a new label by Andrew Jones and Abdul Koroma, had sophistication sewn into every seam of its all-blue, perfectly executed line, featuring powdery suede coats and jackets with pouchy pockets, a mean pair of pants, and a couple of drapey bubble skirts and dresses. Pretty impressive for a pair of newcomers—though not quite so astonishing once you know they met while working for MaxMara in Italy.</p><p>Erdem Moralioglu beat them, though. Showing last—always a bit of a giveaway in these circumstances—the Turkish-Canadian, who was educated at London's Royal College of Art, sent out a romantic collection of fan-pleated chiffon dresses and softly whimsical tailoring. Just guessing, but odds are it was the high-neck, sleeveless printed Edwardian dress, trailing a frilled lemon train that swung it for him.</p></div>"
55,spring,2006,s2006,fendi,"There is sometimes a sense with Fendi's spring collections that the house is treading water before Karl Lagerfeld's exuberant imagination truly lets rip for its highly furred, inventive fall shows. This fresh collection, however, seemed to signal a new creative energy for the season.</p><p>The overscale lace patterns that filtered the backdrop's glowing pink light and shadowed the length of the runway, together with the influence of Lagerfeld muse Amanda Harlech, who was dressed backstage in a turn-of-the-century Irish lace bolero (which the designer found in a vintage store in Biarritz), pointed to a new light touch. Blooming tulip and poodle skirts, and blouses with built-in fichu capes, were made in crisp white piqué, eyelet, lace, and dotted Swiss cotton and given a pastry chef's flourish of spiraling ruffles or lettuce-edged flounces. Less-conventional treatments included laser-cut doily decoration on gleaming white patent, three-dimensional honeycomb appliqués, <em>tremblant</em> embroideries like clusters of wisteria blooms, and, this being Fendi, after all, dresses with their hems cuffed in pastel-colored fox, worked to seem as light as powder puffs.</p><p>And there was a reason for those gigantically buckled belts that cinched dresses high under the bust or skirts low on the hip; they mirrored the buckles on the new B. Fendi bag. Whence the name? ""B for buckle, b for belt, b for bag—B. Fendi!"" laughed Harlech backstage.</p></div>"
56,spring,2006,s2006,salvatore-ferragamo,"Graeme Black proposed a jazzy spring at Salvatore Ferragamo, opening the show with a simple drop-waist dress accessorized with long necklaces and T-straps. He didn't indulge in the Gatsby moment, but used it as a springboard for the elegant and sporty separates that followed—like a classic shirtdress with short satin French-cuffed sleeves, and a layered tank worn with trousers. Color moved from the covetable bags into the collection about halfway through, when Vlada Roslyakova appeared in a neat lilac knit ensemble. A shiny exotic coat in a purpley blue with three-quarter sleeves, belted low, was a standout, and a strapless cut-work evening gown nailed all the season's trends.</p></div>"
57,spring,2006,s2006,giambattista-valli,"Talk about a moment of truth: This was Giambattista Valli's all-important sophomore collection, after making a hasty fall debut when his contract at Ungaro was not renewed last year. His first time out, the audience was inclined to be generous, and the reviews came back mostly positive—not least of all because he took the first baby steps toward establishing his own identity, separate from that of his former employer. But would he be able to keep up the momentum in his second outing? That was the question hanging in the air this morning at the InterContinental hotel's Salon Imperial.</p><p>The answer—from the first look to the last—is a delighted <em>yes,</em> as themes he introduced for fall reappeared with a greater sense of poise and focus. Mixed in with Jacquard tulip coats and chiffon shirtwaist dresses were Valli's favorite trim jackets, now with a more military flavor and paired with shorts or, less successfully, skinny pants casually rolled up below the knee. After dark, it was all about big volumes—bows, bustles, and balloon shapes. In ivory, lemon, and the palest of pinks, Valli's cocktail frocks and ball gowns hinted at Ungaro's teacher, the masterful Cristobal Balenciaga. Whether you catch the irony in that or not, it's a joy to see a designer who has taken his fair share of knocks bounce back and begin to find that rare thing: his own, strong voice.</p></div>"
58,spring,2006,s2006,giles-deacon,"At every Giles Deacon show, there are two types of attendees: those in the inner circle who get it, and those who aren't, who look on disguising puzzlement behind fixed smiles. If you're a Giles <em>in</em> person, you see a young designer aiming to outfit an older customer in respectfully couture-ish clothes, and are thrilled that he can pull Linda Evangelista, Stella Tennant, and Shalom Harlow to walk for him. If you're an <em>out</em> person, you spend the show wondering what kind of woman—older or younger—would really wear these clothes, and fretting over the skills he has at his disposal.</p><p>This season did represent a stylistic shift, at any rate. Dropping the flowy, slightly glam-rock seventies references of his first couple of collections, Deacon reversed into the sixties and its cleaner, pared-down silhouette. He showed leggy Cardin-like shifts in heavy silk, updated with sporty zipper implants and paired with flat sandals, and the occasional silk cagoule, but then mixed that graphic statement with fancier, draped cullings from the legacy of Madame Grès.</p><p>His starting point, he explained, was the work of Colin Self, a painter who created on the cusp of Pop Art in the sixties and whose canvases record that odd moment when mod looks coexisted with trad dressing. An interesting source, but something stalled in the leap to the runway. It takes magic fingers to drape and mold a figure like Madame Grès. Deacon's approximations, fixed onto stiff, conical corsets, made his models look like they were trapped inside inverted 1950's lampshades.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4llx9q""></div></div><p>Deacon's better moments came when he didn't try so hard: a little bustier dress in navy doupioni that hugged the waist and flared into a short skirt, or something soft in kelly green silk, fastened with fabric flowers at the shoulder. Individual dresses from this collection will undoubtedly look good on magazine pages and at the odd offbeat special occasion, but that doesn't solve Deacon's central issues. Either he needs to acquire a fully fledged skill set to pull off this ""couture"" work properly (hardly the easiest route in London), or he needs to get over the ""lady"" thing and start watching what women his own age want to wear.</p></div>"
59,spring,2006,s2006,giorgio-armani,"Need a beaded, shimmering, once-in-a-lifetime gown? Put Giorgio Armani at the top of your shopping list. The finale of his show summed up a lifetime's dedication to defining and refining the starry impact of his crystal-frosted column. For spring, those dresses captured a beautiful fragility in barely-there shadings of ivory, champagne, mushroom, and mauve. Finely layered chiffon and tulle, picked out with minute embroideries of bugle beads and sequins, qualified each one as a singular piece of signature Armani. (We could have done without the hats—a lot less modern-looking than the sleek, oiled, silent-movie hairstyles sported by the rest of the models—but that's a minor quibble.)</p><p>With this collection, the designer said that he had resolved to focus on what women really wear today. On the runway, that translated into soft tailoring and skirts, either tiered or of the floppy tulip variety—all familiar Armani territory. Where he's really amping up his contemporary awareness, though, is in another direction. For the first time, each and every one in his army of models was clutching a different bag. After claiming the night as his own, Mr. Armani is letting it be known he's intent on staking a claim on the handbag business.</p></div>"
60,spring,2006,s2006,givenchy,"There's only one way to sum up what went on at Givenchy: It was painful. First, the drag of crossing traffic-clogged Paris at rush hour, followed by an interminable wait for the show to begin. Then the pretentious presentation: android-faced women circling endlessly in a white space, trussed up in skirts and dresses so constricting it looked like a special form of cruelty to models.</p><p>This was Riccardo Tisci's first stab at Givenchy ready-to-wear, and it was a perplexing move both for the designer and the brand, which has been troubled by several swerves in direction over the past few years. From what was possible to ascertain about Tisci's style, when glimpsed at Givenchy's couture show in July, a kind of gothic romanticism might have been expected. That was nowhere to be seen in this collection, which, with its bandaged, below-the-knee hobble skirts and relentlessly seamed, formfitting jersey dresses, was more an homage to the eighties heyday of Azzedine Alaïa and Thierry Mugler, treading on heavily ugly block-heel shoes.</p><p>The confusion here is as much to do with what Givenchy means to the world at large as it is about the difficult contrivances of Tisci's designs. Since Hubert de Givenchy launched his first collection as a few simple staples to get a woman through her everyday life (a trench, a pair of pants, a black turtleneck, an LBD, and so on), the brand has, in recent times, swung from Alexander McQueen's dominatrix severity to Julien Macdonald's unbridled bling. With Tisci in the hot seat, there's yet another change of gear going on—one that seems diametrically opposed to the approachable, commercial image presented by Liv Tyler in the company's fragrance advertising. Essentially, that leaves Givenchy facing the same question as it was when McQueen arrived: At exactly what kind of woman is it aimed? This nerve-grating collection didn't provide any kind of answer.</p></div>"
61,spring,2006,s2006,gucci,"Ten years after Tom Ford delivered his groundbreaking velvet boot-cut collection, something fresh has finally arrived to revive the buzz at Gucci. It's colorful, ripe with prints, full of feminine, seventies-flavored forties dresses, and it's by a 32-year-old woman, Frida Giannini. ""We've come out of a long period of monochrome,"" she said. ""And I love prints and colors. What I want to do is an intelligent kind of glamour for my generation. I think in this century, every woman wants a private life. You can explore more things than celebrity and the Oscars.""</p><p>After Alessandra Facchinetti's two-season stint at Gucci, Giannini was promoted on the strength of her Flora-print accessory collection, the motif of which was lifted from a fifties Gucci scarf made for Grace Kelly. For spring, she started with boyish day suits—narrow jackets with puffed shoulders, rugby shirts, and skinny mod pants—worn with flat patent boots emblazoned with Gucci horse bits. That look wasn't completely convincing top to toe, but when her print blouses with fluttery cap sleeves and above-the-knee dresses began to walk out, things looked up. Clearly influenced by Saint Laurent's famous 1970 forties collection, the shoes were high patent and suede platform ankle straps.</p><p>Giannini's take on Gucci's brand of sexy is more a matter of a bared back than an exposed front. She designed her long, linear ""hostess"" gowns with ""a party with friends"" in mind, rather than full-on occasions. A couple of them strayed into Rochas territory, but the best, a long cyclamen gown, and the finale, with its pin-tucked top, puff sleeves, and embroidered crystal flowers, had enough presence to go anywhere. Like Phoebe Philo at Chloé, Giannini is determined to set a mandate for a new kind of wearability. Whatever else this collection had going for it, it was different enough to prove that the page has been turned on the dark, erotic look of Tom Ford's nineties.</p></div>"
62,spring,2006,s2006,hermes,"Jean Paul Gaultier has relaxed into his job at Hermès—in a great way. His spring collection, shorn of the nervous-tic horsey puns and heavy-handed homages to French conservative dressing he came in with, made complete sense. In fact, with his white shirtdresses, scarf-print pieces, nicely judged silk cardigans, and brilliant use of that deliciously classy house orange, he has finally cleared up the essential dilemma that has bedeviled the house since it first stepped into the clothing arena.</p><p>To wit: Hermès is a sanctuary for sophisticated women who want quality and classicism—but who also don't want to look like also-rans in the trend stakes. For the first time, Gaultier mixed a perfect elixir of house symbolism and extract of fashion to pique the interest of that hard-to-get but high-spending class. He showed tall platform sandals to act as a foil to a fabulous three-piece white linen pantsuit, made Hermès scarves into pencil skirts and tunics, and turned out the most gorgeous plissé orange goddess dress. These clothes, while registering fashion, elegantly stepped clear of the pitfalls of too much trendiness. Top marks, JPG.</p></div>"
63,spring,2006,s2006,imitation-of-christ,"Tara Subkoff is famous for being a theatrical provocateur, and she definitely delivered the goods this season with the launch of the IOC denim line. Subkoff cast herself as Gidget (replete with blond bangs, wide-leg jeans, and striped tee) and Scarlett Johansson as a <em>Misfits</em>-era Marilyn Monroe (high-waist dark denim and bright red lipstick) to kick off this typically frenzied but stunning show.</p><p>At the Surrogate's Court in lower Manhattan, the first grouping of models, bewigged and handcuffed (and sentenced to some slightly overwrought choreography), descended two majestic staircases in pairs, to the strains of Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)."" The dark denim pieces—jeans, shorts, and dresses both formfitting and free-flowing—all had the word ""imitation"" embroidered over three crosses on the back pocket.</p><p>Things lightened up, literally, as the show progressed and ""Let the Sunshine In"" from <em>Hair</em> replaced wolf cries on the soundtrack. The denim was as bleached as a California blonde, and styled like one, too. Mixed in with the Western looks were eyelet and gingham minidresses with a pixie quality befitting Mary Quant, some worn with modish white boots Subkoff designed for Easy Spirit. (There were also one-of-a-kind hand-painted pieces by Rita Ackermann and Ben Cho, among others, which will be sold to benefit Habitat for Humanity.) This being an IOC show, the amused front row, an art-world who's who that included Cecily Brown, Rachel Feinstein, and Mother Inc., had plenty to gawk at. One model in a trenchcoat flashed a denim penis, followed by dancers <em>en pointe</em> wearing hand-painted dresses Subkoff showed during the Paris couture.</p></div>"
64,spring,2006,s2006,j-mendel,"It wasn't that long ago that the idea of a spring collection from furrier J. Mendel seemed indulgent, silly even. Who south of Saskatchewan really needs mink after March? What a difference a year makes. Gilles Mendel's front row was socialite city, and can't you just see them clamoring for his broadtail bolero vests? Ultraluxe pelts aside, there was plenty to love in this collection, starting with a smart little suit pieced together from panels of washed gold canvas and chiffon trim. As with most of his numbers, its edges were frayed; for all of Mendel's talents as a tailleur, he loves to deconstruct his fabrics.</p><p>At night, he really shined, but not in a predictable way. The sparkle of last season's bullion embroidery has been replaced with matte white beads or, more frequently, with an absence of ornamentation that let his sinuous silhouettes in barely-there face-powder shades take center stage. By this point in the season, the tiered evening column gown has already become familiar, but Mendel's hand-worked numbers, with their chevrons of chiffon, were in a category of their own.</p></div>"
65,spring,2006,s2006,jean-paul-gaultier,"Who doesn't dream of a quiet life in the country—especially on a day like today, when a transit strike slowed Paris traffic to a crawl? But many abandoned their bucolic fantasies this afternoon at the Jean Paul Gaultier show. The <em>odeur</em> rising from a runway lined several inches thick with hay was distinctly barnyard, and 40 minutes into the wait for the start of the show, the ushers' eyes were burning and the audience was fanning away the smell.</p><p>Too bad, because there was plenty to like about Gaultier's romp through the rural life, starting with his familiar peasant blouses—this season in cream and wine silk delicately embroidered in black—and continuing through to his gypsy dresses, in bold florals edged with lace rather than last year's stripes. He didn't neglect his trademark sharp tailoring, either—there was nothing bumpkinish about a cream cropped jacket with tuxedo tails, worn with a matching slim skirt.</p><p>Less soigné were trousers and shorts so high-waisted they grazed breastbones and which hung from the shoulders with the help of suspenders. But those farmer pants aside, Gaultier's spring collection was unrepentantly girly—especially when it came to evening dresses. Suggesting old-time nightgowns (but in sheer silks, not scratchy cottons) and accessorized with straw in the hair (which was just the beginning of the outlandish headwear), they seemed designed to inspire a roll in the hay. Let's just hope it's freshly bundled.</p></div>"
66,spring,2006,s2006,jenni-kayne,"Jenni Kayne brought her spring collection from her native L.A. to New York in an effort, she said, ""to be taken more seriously."" The clothes had a more focused look than her previous efforts, in part because she staged a well-edited presentation of just 16 looks rather than a star-studded fashion show. As the familiar saying goes, though, you can take the girl out of California, but you can't take California out of the girl. Inspired by seventies beach club culture, she started with a U-neck, long jersey dress, and from there matched smart knits with lovely lace skirts and of-the-moment cuffed shorts. A fitted blazer and cropped trousers in tweed, along with a bronze sequin apron dress, gave a nod to the show's cosmopolitan location, but most of the colors had a warm, beachy feel: navy, white, sandy beige, and sunny yellow.</p></div>"
67,spring,2006,s2006,jeremy-laing,"Jeremy Laing is a stealth entry to the spring season. Though his show, 19-looks strong, was not posted on the fashion calendar, he presented Sunday in the elegant, marble-floored Knoll showroom. It's the second time out for this 26-year-old Toronto native, who has worked with the London-based label Preen and with Alexander McQueen. Last fall, he showed a promising collection—assembled in just three weeks—at Lia Gangitano's Participant Inc. gallery. But spring found him solidly prepared and in an elegant mood.</p><p>Many of the clothes featured what he called a volant silhouette: winglike extensions of cloth that created a graphic line when viewed in profile, but beautifully framed the draped pieces when seen straight on. Dresses and skirts had full trapeze shapes. Pants were high-waisted and paired with coats, emphasizing a long line, while shorts were toped with vests and boleros. Fabrics ranged from airy parachute silks and luminous taffeta to more-substantial canvas and tie silk. The collection wasn't perfect, but it was a find, and Laing may well be ready for his own timeslot.</p></div>"
68,spring,2006,s2006,jil-sander,"Waiting for Raf Simons—if not Godot—is the name of the game at Jil Sander. Doing its best to keep her minimalist leftovers warm, a nameless backroom team is designing the collection until the young Belgian appears, as promised, next season.</p><p>The result—no surprise—was tepid. For starters, the committee had boiled down the essence of Sander to a white shirt and a cream, asymmetric wrapover skirt, which, though unobjectionable in itself, couldn't help but look bland. Other pieces—cigarette pants and shirts appliquéd with graphic patches, a funnel-neck white linen coat, a wraparound strapless dress fastened with a traily ribbon, and a zip-front shorts suit—illustrated how badly the label needs a fresh, intellectual designer to justify its standing as a thinking-woman's luxury brand. By the time Simons arrives, he'll have to tackle the issue of whether nineties minimalism itself can be renovated. That's the challenge, but it's good to look forward to a time when, with a strong leader installed, this collection will have something more interesting to say.</p></div>"
69,spring,2006,s2006,jill-stuart,"""Jill Stuart is a rock star in Japan,"" exclaimed vintage dealer Mark Walsh after the show. It's easy to see why; backstage, Stuart said that she was focused on ""innocence and sensuality,"" qualities that play big in the East. Although the Asian presence was larger than ever at this girly, frilly show, the collection may play well at home this time, too.</p><p>The opening look on Ekaterina, a diaphanous white baby-doll dress with lace trimmings, set the mood for the lingerie-inspired looks that followed. A pale palette was dappled with tea-stained tulle blouses, with rosettes and lace insets, matched with slim skirts. Yellow, peach, and pale-pink dresses mingled among the designer's self-designed floral chiffon prints. All were adorned with corsages and pinwheels of ribbon work and asymmetric hems. The white, crochet-front bathing suits with shirred backs had a forties fabulousness, and the petal dresses just before the finale were simply charming.</p><p>This season, Stuart's obsession with vintage and artisanal techniques proved to be a winning combination, since it meshed well with spring's emphasis on decorative handicrafts. Despite some misses, Stuart's overall idiosyncratic aesthetic fit into the bigger picture. All of that intricate, hand-done ribbon work, Irish crochet, rosettes, and corsages added up to a collection that was refreshingly consistent and will boost her fan base on both sides of the Pacific.</p></div>"
70,spring,2006,s2006,john-galliano,"If there's one thing you can rely on John Galliano to provide, it's entertainment—though not necessarily the kind where the audience is meant to be scribbling down style numbers or sketching dresses. This season, his roll-up, roll-up fashion sideshow had a moral: Everybody's beautiful; live and let live; respect one another—that sort of thing. Against a schlocky 1920's Art Deco theater set, he sent out a parade of proud couples—grande dames and gigolos, blondes and sugar daddies, fat ladies and admiring lovers, lipstick lesbians, bearded transvestites, and midget fiancés—about to be wed.</p><p>It's a long time since the fashion world has been reminded that humanity contains more variety than the standard race of 5-foot-10 skinnies who populate the runways. And Galliano's alternative cast, coiffed and made up in a style that suggested cabaret performers and their patrons, played their parts with a celebratory sense of enjoyment. Sure enough, the contagious atmosphere sent a rare outbreak of smiles through the show-fatigued audience.</p><p>Those who were also scrutinizing the presentation for a Galliano fashion update among the costumes came away with slim pickings, however. There were a couple of sinuous, vaguely twenties, Spanish hot-pink chiffon dresses, some champagne satin corseted gowns swathed in green tulle, the odd net-veiled jacket, and a bit of jeanswear going on. But beyond that, precious few clues about what this collection will look like once it reaches stores. Still, that's the way Galliano likes to project his house image these days: frolics on the runway, frocks back at the shop.</p></div>"
71,spring,2006,s2006,jonathan-saunders,"Half of Jonathan Saunders' aesthetic veers towards electro music and hard-edged va-va-voom eighties graphics; the other half prefers fluttery, dotty prettiness. Thus, his audience was jolted around in an East End studio, trying to figure what his spring collection was about. <em>Dresses</em> is the quick answer—but the provenance of the color and print takes a bit more explaining.</p><p>Obligingly, Saunders listed the art-based influences that went into his long basket-woven chiffons, floor-length columns, and short, body-conscious dresses. His program notes paid homage to David Hockney, Anthony Caro, and Irving Penn—imagery that, put through the blender of Saunders' imagination, ended up as a palette of saturated blue, ochre, orange, gray, and black. Some of the pieces, like an artily polka-dotted short-waist dress with a full skirt would work well on a young starlet. Others were clunkers, but that's life.</p></div>"
72,spring,2006,s2006,junya-watanabe,"Fed up with pretty, polite, ladylike retro? The young Japanese are. Junya Watanabe, like his compatriot Jun Takahashi of Undercover, is trying to beat a path forward by reverting to rock as a source of ideas. Heads bristling with massive spiked paper Mohawks, faces masked in cling film, his imaginary gang of psycho-punks stomped out in skinny cropped bondage pants, heavy skinhead boots, and skewed, cutaway, pulled-back versions of trenchcoats.</p><p>Watanabe said he'd been inspired by a Japanese band that delights in the name Mad Capture Maggots. The results involved a lot of patching together of chopped-up tour T-shirts, ripped crochet leggings, distressed leather, and camouflage prints. Still, whatever's rocking Watanabe's world at the moment, he'll never make a totally convincing convert to street toughness. For all the full-on energy of this show, it somehow couldn't help but echo his sweet, career-long romance with traily long dresses and Edwardian frock coats—even if, this season, they're pretending to slam doors and sulk.</p></div>"
73,spring,2006,s2006,kai-kuhne,"The much-publicized breakup of As Four has launched a flurry of rumors and speculation about who was the driving force and talent behind the intriguing line. A large downtown crowd gathered for the debut of Myself, by As Four defector Kai Kühne, searching for answers (and scoop) in the 37-piece collection.</p><p>Anyone familiar with the theatrical designer's personal style could recognize his own wardrobe favorites throughout, particularly in the equestrian and menswear-inspired pieces. Nostalgic references to Kühne's previous job were few—a pair of bubble shorts, some diaper drapes, jodhpurs—and mostly fell flat. The strongest pieces in this first outing were the shirtdresses and coats. A silk tuxedo shirtdress worn by Bianca Klamt was elegant enough for a latter-day Holly Golightly. Another version in tucked white cotton was experimental but still wearable. Each trenchcoat in the collection, and there were a few, had distinct details; one with oversize buttoned belt loops merits particular mention. A white coat with cocoon sleeves was a stunner.</p><p>For the most part, Kühne's looser garments out-matched his tailoring. Some sporty skirts and a pair of evergreen textured silk shorts were among the more viable takes on jaunty separates, but an off-the-shoulder sea-print silk blouse was a more singular statement. Three Empire-waist gowns, one with a feathered bodice and muslin body, closed the show on a high note. If the collection, overall, was a mix of hits and misses, it was a personal one, in more than name alone. With it, he proved that <em>one</em> doesn't have to be the loneliest number after all.</p></div>"
74,spring,2006,s2006,kenneth-cole-new-york,"The consciousness-raising videos that precede every Kenneth Cole show are not known for their subtlety. And considering that the toll of Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast is still being assessed, Cole had particularly potent material this season. While his recruits Whoopi Goldberg and the FVU (Fashion Victims Unit) laid the message on extra-thick, the designer's passion for helping survivors by donating to the Red Cross came through loud and clear.</p><p>Just like his film, Cole's presentation could have done with a firm edit—fewer looks, at a faster pace, would have got his fashion message across more efficiently. He kicked things off with a great pair of full trousers, topped with a high waist and wide belt that reappeared on pencil skirts, knee-length pants, and blouson shorts. Elsewhere, he riffed on American classics: cropping a leather trench above the hips, adding a playful ruffle to a wrap dress, and cutting a jacket in a utilitarian paper-nylon material that shined like taffeta. No-frills jersey was pleated and smocked into tops as comfy as an old T-shirt, but still plenty chic. As for the crinkled-chiffon dresses worn with ballet flats that closed the show, they came in colors luscious enough to make his customers forget entirely about last season's triumphant return of basic, head-to-toe black.</p></div>"
75,spring,2006,s2006,kenzo,"With cardboard waves, clouds, and seagulls as a backdrop and a boardwalk/runway elevated above acres of sand, Antonio Marras' spring Kenzo collection set off prettily from Brittany and docked in Provence. It wasn't all plain sailing, though, because along the way, there was an implausible stopover at Euro Disney, not to mention a quick tour of the children's nursery.</p><p>Marras began then with a saucy nautical theme: Navy-and-white-striped clingy knits and tailored sailor suits came with matching berets. To finish, he sent out floor-length silhouettes: floral gowns with pink gingham accents, a crocheted suit, and a lacy pinafore dress that, topped with a straw hat, called to mind Little Bo Peep. Somewhere in the middle, a couple of polka-dot chiffon looks were accessorized with Minnie Mouse ears.</p><p>After their exits, the models made their way onto a cardboard ship waiting in the wings. When the last one swaggered aboard, wearing a man's tuxedo that made one think of the ill-fated couple in Marguerite Duras' novel <em>The Lover,</em> the foghorn bleated, and the boat came into view. Then, while confetti blew sideways from a wind machine, the girls disembarked for a final lap around the boardwalk. It made for good theater, though Marras might do well to remember that modern women are less interested in costumes than well-designed clothes. He had plenty of the latter, but a little less eccentricity would have gone a long way.</p></div>"
76,spring,2006,s2006,l-a-m-b-,"Hours before her first-ever runway show would begin, Gwen Stefani was hurtling through back-to-back interviews in Roseland Ballroom's basement. ""My inspiration for this show is the same as it's been all my life,"" she said. ""A little <em>Sound of Music,</em> some Orange County chola girl, some Rasta, and a bit of <em>The Great Gatsby.</em>"" Given all of the press she's done in anticipation of her L.A.M.B. runway debut, it's no surprise she has the sound bytes and fashion shorthand down pat. Soon after the lights dimmed (just shy of an hour behind schedule), the first three influences became clear. Remakes of the von Trapp family's greatest hits blared from the speakers, four O.C.-ready low-riders parked along the room's perimeter bounced on their axles, and a bevy of beauties, their hair in cornrows and their lips lined in dark pencil, hit the glitter-strewn runway in red, black, yellow, and green knits. The Fitzgerald reference was mostly lost on this observer, but no matter.</p><p>Stefani is the most dedicated of our celebrity designers, and certainly the most talented. She waited four seasons before she brought her collection to the catwalk, and it paid off. Not only was it wide-ranging—encompassing day (cashmere cardigans) and evening (scallop-hemmed cocktail dresses), sporty (tracksuits) and elegant (thirties-style siren gowns)—it was also well made. Standouts included versions of the silk crepe tank dress the singer wore last week to Fashion Rocks, a python-print group, and wool admiral jackets. This multitalented star deserves a <em>hollaback</em> to the runway, and this Roseland spectacle was worth the wait.</p></div>"
77,spring,2006,s2006,lacoste,"There is more to Lacoste than piqué polos. So says Christophe Lemaire, its creative director. The line, which was founded in 1933, has a cult following and a long, quirky history to boot. The famed logo was born of a bet: French tennis champion René Lacoste agreed to a wager with his team captain—alligator suitcase in exchange for a win. He lost. The local papers, seizing an opportunity, claimed he ""fought like an alligator"" anyway, <em>et voilà,</em> a brand was born.</p><p>But where does fashion fit in? While preppy wardrobes the world over have at least one Lacoste item in their inventory, and pros like Andy Roddick (seated in the front row) wear the label well on the court, it has never been considered runway material. Not until Lemaire came on board. A seasoned designer who put in time at Thierry Mugler, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Lacroix before establishing his own line, he's taken Lacroix's ""master of the mix"" approach and applied it to this staid, steadfast brand. This season, his inspiration was Japanese and Brazilian street styles and ""funny colors and patterns mixed in a funky way."" Spring for Lemaire and Lacoste is a riot of mismatched stripes, brights and flouros, snug striped polos, color-blocked halters, dot-print bathing suits, and minis and hoodies. The shoes, such as flat sneakers, slides, and modish booties, were aces. But faults could be called for the forced ""fashion"" styling: Broad headbands and helmet-like hats were false notes in the show, when just the adorable tomato-red baseball caps would have been fine.</p></div>"
78,spring,2006,s2006,lagerfeld-gallery,"As the Lagerfeld Gallery show finally got under way after an even longer than usual delay (thank the Carrousel du Louvre's arduous security procedure), it looked like the designer was going to stick to riffs on his signature strict suiting—this time with white shirts trailing floor-grazing arm bands. But Lagerfeld did introduce a more feminine note to the proceedings, via jackets, vests, and sheaths with circular and teardrop-shape cutouts. For evening, he was of two minds: On the one hand, there was a beaded cocktail dress with spaghetti straps, and on the other, a chiffon gown that was sleeveless and sheer in parts—not necessarily practical, but not predictable either.</p><p>Lagerfeld sold this label to Tommy Hilfiger less than a year ago, with growing the business topmost in his mind. But if he's really thinking big, it would've been nice to see more of his fantastic—not to mention highly bankable—denim.</p></div>"
79,spring,2006,s2006,lanvin,"Who'd have guessed that Alber Elbaz, the man who bestowed soft decorative dressing on the world two years ago, would be the first to break away into a new, fiercely exciting minimalism? That was what he achieved for spring: a rigorous, couture-informed reengineering of clothes for women who spend more time striding out in the world than simpering at cocktail parties.</p><p>""Modernity is always in a rush,"" he said of his speedily zipped-up narrow skirts, shirts, and ties; kimono-derived dresses; and tapered pants, pulled in with wide patent or elastic belts. The subtleties (because minimalism can never again mean a matte black sheath) were in the looping drape of a back view, the folded bands pressed flat into the front of a dress, suggesting obis, and the textures: washed satin, gazar, and an extraordinary scarlet metal-thread material with the 3-D appearance of velvet, crunched into a luxurious Lanvin trench.</p><p>Still, the place where Elbaz's brilliant flash of insight really starts is at the feet. He knows we know life always looks better viewed atop a fantastic pair of shoes. Lanvin's red, turquoise, emerald, and yellow patent platforms are killer-class accessories that up confidence and dramatically alter proportions. If Elbaz drew, as always, on his old-school training in couture methods for the clothes, it was auto components that inspired him to think, he said, of ""designing shoes like varnished cars—like a Cadillac!"" One of the best examples had a high conical heel, a thick platform, and two python straps, one white, one navy. It showed exactly how a designer as influential as Elbaz can make the decisive difference between what went on six months ago and what's right now. Genius.</p></div>"
80,spring,2006,s2006,libertine,"Libertine took a romp through the British Isles for its spring collection. Queen Victoria replaced Abraham Lincoln as Johnson Hartig and Cindy Greene's seasonal poster child, and they traded nineteenth-century American motifs in favor of portraits of her highness and poets Keats and Shelley. Libertine's signature silk-screens on one-of-a kind reconstructed vintage was back this season, but on a smaller scale. This time around, the focus was on Swarovski crystals, affixed to tulle and velvet, for example, through a heat-transfer technique in flower bouquet, spider web, rose, and skull motifs.</p><p>Standouts included a pink rose-flocked coat with a silk-screen lining worn by Lily Cole and a brocade dress with an array of sparkling Victoria cameos attached to it. Alexandra Richards in a lacy, sparkly cheerleader's skirt and a sparkling skull motorcycle jacket had a good-girl-gone-bad vibe. T-shirts with ""Drink Old English Dry,"" ""Our Man Keats,"" and ""Our Man Victoria"" slogans, which referenced the anti-Pershing tee Katharine Hamnett wore when presented to Queen Elizabeth, offered a more irreverent take on the Old English theme.</p><p>Another highlight was a pair of trenches, adorned with Brit artist Damien Hirst's spin paintings (he barters his art for clothes with the duo), signed and dated ""9/9/05,"" taking Libertine's one-off ethos to a new level.</p></div>"
81,spring,2006,s2006,louis-vuitton,"It fell to Louis Vuitton to throw a gigantic end-of-collections party that lit up the rococo exterior of the Petit Palais like a giant L.V. trunk and celebrated the reopening of the extraordinary art-installed high-tech wonderland that is its Champs-Elysées flagship. It therefore fell to Marc Jacobs, too, to match the hedonistic moment by doing something majorly loud and celebratory on the runway. In that way, he did not let the side down: Out charged the L.V. girl army in short, hot-pink, body-conscious, bejeweled clothes. Clanking with gold medallions, weighed down with charm bracelets, and toting plastic-covered scarf-print bags, they looked almost as if they'd walked straight out of eighties Italian fashion photographs, by way of Graceland. Versace, Krizia, Ferré—Elvis!</p><p>Why did Jacobs choose those references? Partly, no doubt, to annoy the grown-ups—who tend to come over queasy when forced to face a flashback of their eighties embarrassments—and to reinforce the fact that Louis Vuitton is aimed at global twentysomethings, who are currently loving a bit of revived Versace. And partly, just for the hell of it. ""Why not? We were looking at decoration and color and sun, and at designers whose work we haven't looked at for a long time,"" he declared. ""And, you know—it really doesn't matter any more. The truth is, everything you want to wear is fine and great. <em>Vive la différence!</em>"" As a last word on the season, that couldn't help but set the brain whirring about what will happen next. Is fashion about to plunge into its first outbreak of exuberant excess since Tom Ford left the scene? If so, it's about time.</p></div>"
82,spring,2006,s2006,luca-luca,"Luca Orlandi, fresh from his wedding to model girlfriend Oluchi Onweagba in St. Bart's, invited guests to a subtropical ""fashion journey"" tonight. Jamaican music played loudly, and the designer promised playful clothes in Caribbean colors. Many celebrities were happy to join the designer's party, among them Paris Hilton, Mary J. Blige, Kelly Osbourne, Damon Dash and Rachel Roy, the Williams sisters, assorted socialites. But while the flashier attendees texted and waved to each other, significant numbers of press people, who are definitely not on vacation this week, were less than amused to be kept waiting for a late start. The question was: Did Orlandi want to stage a red-carpet-style extravaganza or present a serious collection for critical review?</p><p>If the audience was spectacular, the clothes were less so. The poufy taffeta dresses, a continuation from the fall show, were overdone. In contrast, there were pretty cotton and lace numbers that had a more natural, summery ease. Romina Lanaro, in a cotton Jacquard top and cardigan worn with full linen pants and flats was the image of casual sophistication. Orlandi's series of strawberry-embroidered cotton voile pieces evoked the sweetness of rural 1950's Italy. The Caribbean items were less successful, overwrought with too many patterns and embellishments. A printed and draped dress could have done without a corsage or beading, for example, and even the deftest hand would have trouble making a mini Liberty-style print live happily with a tropical one. There are pretty clothes to pull from this collection, but for the most part, Orlandi's Fantasy Island could benefit from a dose of reality.</p></div>"
83,spring,2006,s2006,luella,"The New York Yacht Club was a fitting location for Luella Bartley's show, what with the nautical blue-and-white striped sweater, navy blazer complete with family crest, and rope-trimmed short shifts on the runway. One tank dress was even emblazoned with what looked like a white lifesaver on its back. There were also tiny tennis skirts and tight jodhpurs, plus plenty of V-neck sweaters, oxford shirts, and seersucker jackets for lunch after a morning playing doubles. The Luella girl will at least be looking sporty this spring, whether or not she drops anchor or touches a racquet.</p><p>It wasn't all fun and genteel games on Bartley's runway. Carmen Kass, for one, worked a black cropped suede jacket and a jet sequined pencil skirt, which appeared later on in emerald green paired inexplicably with a button-down in baby pink. Stovepipe jeans and graphic tees, meanwhile, were inspired by the Velvet Underground and Nico in the late sixties, whose song ""Sunday Morning"" played on the loudspeakers as the crowd filed in. Bartley's message wasn't exactly incoherent, but it was definitely confusing… and perhaps a little on the young side for her spendy price point. What <em>did</em> look focused, however, were her accessories: spectators, peekaboo patent pumps, high-heel loafers in primary colors with contrasting piping, and of course, her bags. Some came decorated with bright plastic charms to match her gotta-have-one heart-shaped cuffs.</p></div>"
84,spring,2006,s2006,maison-martin-margiela,"The women in Martin Margiela’s show looked like they were posing amid a strange sort of fashion construction site. Each was wheeled out on her own trolley, slowly pushed along train tracks by a black-clad assistant. The first model, her body slicked with oil, was wearing a pair of white pants, with a cummerbund for a bra. One trouser leg was wider and longer than the other, trailing off into an unfinished hem. It had an industrial red-and-white-striped “caution” sticker taped up the side.</p><p>That was only the opening gambit in a collection that had begun in Margiela’s head as an idea about “dissolving” the structure of clothing. Every outfit came with one side finished and the other melting off into raw fabric. A couple of dresses still had bolts of fabric attached. And then, to underline the theme, there was the extraordinary jewelry—necklaces and bracelets made of ice cubes, which, in the process of melting, marked the clothes with streaks of blue or magenta.</p><p>If all that sounds like a crazy intellectual essay on work in progress, don't be too put off. This was also a hot display of grittily glamorous womanhood, as exemplified by the strong-featured, grown-up yet languorous models Margiela had selected from street castings. As they shifted their slick bodies and shook their tousled hair, they radiated enough sexual heat to reduce any man to a pool of water at their feet. As for fashion content: In a season when the stock of pantsuits is steeply on the rise, Margiela’s masterful tailoring is some of the most sophisticated around.</p></div>"
85,spring,2006,s2006,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The marching band had packed up and headed back to Pennsylvania by the time Marc Jacobs' second collection, Marc by Marc Jacobs, hit the runway. But its musicians' exuberance would have been inappropriate anyway. Maybe a symphony would have been better, with so many ballerina-on-her-day-off looks speeding down the runway. Layering, of course, is a signature of this secondary line, and for spring, Jacobs topped unitards with everything from a parachute jacket to a floral-print silk dress.</p><p>There were also arm-warmers, leggings, and stirrup pants, which, sadly, still aren't ripe for a comeback. Anyone in the audience old enough to remember wearing them the first time got a good laugh, at least.</p><p>As befits a dancer, he used soft, cozy materials like French terry, cotton sateen, voile, and summer twill, in a palette of mostly pastels with shots of black and navy, and precious few of his signature zany prints. Jacobs helped catapult the category of designer jeans, but the denim he showed Tuesday wasn't of the standard five-pocket variety. Instead, he cut it into baggy pants, flouncy dresses, and overalls with a retro vibe. Was that one-shoulder indigo jersey dress a <em>Fame</em> moment? Could be. But our vote for best revival goes to a less literal, more modern interpretation of that eighties classic, the cream terry tee with a scooped back.</p></div>"
86,spring,2006,s2006,marc-jacobs,"When the clock struck 8 on Monday night, Marc Jacobs, his clothes, and his models had been in the ready position for a good half hour. As waiters passed around chilled bottles of Perrier, the designer's publicists joked that, in a break from tradition, it would be the editors and retailers who held up the show (for this season, at least). And what a show it was. At 8:25, after the last of the fabulous and tardy scooted in (yes, Lindsay Lohan and Lil' Kim, we're talking to you), the Penn State Blue Band marched onto the runway and broke into a rendition of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" that had everyone dancing in their seats.</p><p>It's the fifth time the designer has included the iconic song on his runway soundtrack. Why the repetition? ""Because it's the anthem of teenage angst,"" he said backstage. The designer, well beyond his teens, doesn't have much to be angsty about these days, but he's never met a girl who smoked in the school bathroom who he didn't like. The show started off with a series of uniforms, and if Snejana's black gabardine jumper and white cotton shirt spelled teacher's pet, Anouck's windbreaker and pleated skirt with net slip peaking out from underneath spelled troublemaker. From there, he moved on to what he called ""blown-up American classics"": Pea jackets, cashmere sweatshirts, and cuffed shorts were, like his voluminous Fall clothes, quite literally blown up, and looked puffed with air.</p><p>After his directional fall collection, this Spring show could've been deflating. But Jacobs seemed determined not to let that happen. Showing slow-dance-appropriate silvery party dresses (several falling in tiers of lace or lamé to the floor) and then releasing a cascade of glittering confetti made everyone in the house—jaded front row included—feel like prom kings and queens for a day.</p></div>"
87,spring,2006,s2006,marni,"Consuelo Castiglioni is a case study in Milanese fashion. In a city where so many lines scramble to latch on to every passing trend, she has steadily progressed from the margins to a position of influence—like Miuccia Prada before her—by staying true to herself. We all know what ""Marni-esque"" means: It's shorthand for a guilelessly studied assemblage of fifties and sixties prints and anti-fitted shapes, which are now copied all over the place.</p><p>For spring, the Marni pieces we expect were there: the short, wide raglan-sleeve fifties jackets, the loosely fitted summer dresses, the duster coats pulled in with belts—all made with that familiar air of happy accidents at the home sewing machine. This season, the offbeat colors—ochre, ecru, salmon, emerald, charcoal, violet, pimento, and washes of blue—were drawn from Castiglioni's modern art studies (she cites Yves Klein, Robert Rauschenberg, Ross Bleckner, and Ugo Rondinone). But it's her odd eye for an accessory that's now coming through strongest. The quirky mix of patent leather, string, resin discs, plastic plaques, big clunky buckles, and foil sequins worked into belts, bags, and jewelry adds something completely new to a look that now has fans shopping in hordes.</p></div>"
88,spring,2006,s2006,martin-grant,"Martin Grant said <em>Kind of Blue,</em> the Miles Davis masterpiece, was a starting point for his spring collection. Fittingly, he showed lovely cocktail dresses in shades ranging from navy to the palest aqua. The jazziest of the group came in taffeta with a pleated, strapless bodice, a glittering ribbon waistband, and a gathered hem. Pleating and paneling were persistent riffs in this show, decorating coats with tulip silhouettes and three-quarter sleeves, and adding intrigue to simple but exquisitely finished sheaths.</p><p>Grant's dirndls, with their pin-tuck details, displayed a deft hand. But hip-skimming pencil skirts were more of-the-moment, and leather embellished with broderie anglaise had a welcome edge. The same could be said for cuffed linen-cotton shorts, which, when paired with smartly tailored sailor and pea jackets, evoked school uniforms. Grant cuts a gorgeous trench, as anyone who's followed his career from private dressmaker to ready-to-wear designer knows, and his oyster satin evening version looked like a dream. But Grant may need to take more risks, and incorporate some of the improvisational magic his musician muse Davis was known for, if he wants to reach similar creative heights.</p></div>"
89,spring,2006,s2006,mary-ping,"Though based on the Upper East Side, Mary Ping has a growing fan base downtown—and an aesthetic that toggles between private school preppy and girl with boyfriend in the band. For the latter, the designer's provocative, draped-front, T-back jersey dress will surely keep groupies at bay. On the whole, however, Ping was feeling more bookish than bad girl for spring, and her shirtdresses, especially one in pale blue, were timely. Paired with a linen denim anorak, shorts in ivory wide-wale cord looked at once smart and sardonic. A waxed trench was a compelling take on a wardrobe staple, and Ping's crinkle crepe satin jumpsuit, as elegantly flou as it was edgy, provided a welcome alternative to an after-eight gown.</p></div>"
90,spring,2006,s2006,matthew-williamson,"Industria Studios' sun-drenched interior was an unexpected location for Matthew Williamson's Spring show. Until now, he's been most closely identified with clothes made for the darker, wee hours. These days, though, he seems eager to expand his reputation. The thigh-grazing cashmere cardigan he paired with silk shorts and jacquard trousers is among the most elegant things onto which he's ever sewn his label. The same goes for his pencil skirts with snappy kick pleats in the back.</p><p>His metallic cotton jacket, vest, and skirt, on the other hand, were appropriate for neither boardroom nor Bungalow 8. But his silk dresses are bound to appear at the latter, perhaps on the backs of his front-row guests Padma Lakshmi and Helena Christensen. This season, they appeared in M.C. Escher and colorful honeycomb prints. There was a smidge too much Rajasthan in his embroidered vest and pearl-dusted heels, but Williamson knows that for his girls, the more beading the better. Among the handful of jewel-encrusted looks, the trompe l'oeil designs and a flapperish dress left the most lasting impressions.</p></div>"
91,spring,2006,s2006,maurizio-pecoraro,"Inspired by the idea of a Japanese garden, Maurizio Pecoraro showed a serene spring collection in shades of gray, ivory, and black. Jovita blossomed in a dress of hand-dyed and embroidered flowers with aged Swarovski crystals on tulle. A fan of embellishment—the more three-dimensional the better—he replicated the effect of broderie anglaise with crystals, sequins, and studs. Elsewhere, puffed and then crushed drop sleeves had the tactile appeal of overripe peonies.</p><p>Pecoraro has a special talent for coats, which he showed worn loose and open for spring. Standouts included one in a daisy-print panne velvet with linen collar and hem, as well as the flower-trimmed styles, one of airy ivory macramé. A jersey dress with velvet stripes was unexpectedly sporty, even tied with a flower belt. In this collection, as in any garden, however Zen, there were prize blooms as well as weeds, and it would have benefited from some bonsai-style editing.</p></div>"
92,spring,2006,s2006,max-mara,"There's a puzzling disconnect between MaxMara's stores—brightly lit havens of well thought-out, sanely presented wardrobe options—and what transpires at its runway shows. The dark and cavernous exhibition hall where this Milan fashion powerhouse persists in putting up its presentations is a bit of a mood dampener, first of all. And the show itself, teasing out its design conceits in many passages, tends to make audience concentration wilt beneath the repetitions.</p><p>What MaxMara's design team decided on as seasonal innovations were big, striped sailor T-shirtdresses, a feeling for loose shapes, mannish styling, and a bit of eighties avant garde influence in the way of elasticized gatherings. What MaxMara does best for spring, though—that would be updates on burlap and linen safari-style pieces, camp shirts, summer trenches, and easy, wide pants with paper bag waists—was thankfully unchanged. Too bad, then, that those pieces had nothing to do with other distractions, like oversize jumpers styled like men's trousers, roomy playsuits, and primary-color silk hobble dresses. It's no slight to say that this highly regarded house could far better display its strengths in real, pragmatic dressing with a well-focused showroom presentation.</p></div>"
93,spring,2006,s2006,menichetti,"Roberto Menichetti's hobbyhorse is the marriage of high-tech materials to sportswear staples, and this season found him back in the well-worn saddle. He called the collection <em>Essentialism,</em> and his models, with their scrubbed faces and stark center parts, contributed to the minimalist feel, as did a palette of navy, khaki, and white, enlivened here and there by metallics. The classics worked best; the strict coats especially. Two camel numbers, one tied at the neck, another a topper with cuffed sleeves, stood out. So did the blue trench worn by Eva Riccobono. A gray dress enlivened with embroidered polka dots (or, in Menichetti parlance, ""modules"") was also interesting. But as ""intelligent"" as Menichetti's fabrics might be, they can seem stiff on the body. His exercises in design are always clever, but the emotional component is sometimes hard to locate.</p></div>"
94,spring,2006,s2006,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors is a native New Yorker with serious prairie envy. Time and again, the designer seeks inspiration in America's open spaces. For spring, he set his sights on the Southwest and designed a collection that was half Texas, half Taos, but not without an urban edge. After all, his big-city girls, like Catherine Zeta-Jones, who, along with husband Michael Douglas, unleashed a paparazzi melee at the show, want to look chic no matter what their destination may be.</p><p>To that end, he offered up warm-weather staples with a rich seventies bent, like safari shirts, gauchos, and scarf dresses. There were ecrus, olives, browns, crisp blacks and whites, and painted desert accents of orange and red. Kors can't resist matching a bikini top with a full skirt; when the bottoms were on display, they were of the high-waist retro variety. (Gratefully, those eyelet numbers were lined.)</p><p>It wasn't all fun in the sun. Take away the hat tied around her neck, and Lisa Cant's black wool serge bolero and cropped pants go from Santa Fe to Manhattan's Upper East Side. Of course, his eveningwear—this season in tiers of chantilly lace and point d'esprit—is always gala ready, regardless of the time zone or backdrop.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""jf17go""></div></div><p>Now back to the desert. Some members of the audience questioned Kors' use of camouflage. Was it a political statement, a message of support for our troops, or neither? One thing's for certain: His hand-painted camo-backed mink balmacaan is likely to inspire a waiting list a country mile long.</p></div>"
95,spring,2006,s2006,michon-schur,"With just 20 pretty pieces, Angelino and FIDM-trained Stephanie Schur earned good standing among the dress-focused small collections that have been cropping up on the schedule. At her first presentation, today at the Prince George Ballroom, Schur conceded that baby son Jake was the impetus behind her career. ""He reinspired me,"" the designer said.</p><p>New life may be Schur's motivation, but her aesthetic is undeniably informed by the past: ""I am inspired by the vintage idea of detail, and handiwork,"" she said. This was evident in pieces like a smocked lingerie top with lace inserts at the bust, and the styling, which included pretty headpieces. A dress of gold rose-patterned Solstiss lace with scalloped hem and a black silk ruffle collar nodded to the twenties, when the collection's muses, iconic model-photographer Lee Miller and Anaïs Nin, were in their primes. A light-blue pin-tucked tank paired with slim, slightly cropped black satin pants and a crinkled silk trench was very much of the moment and had a casual elegance just right for young social types, like Victoria Traina, who attended the presentation.</p></div>"
96,spring,2006,s2006,missoni,"Angela Missoni's collection reflected the passion for prettiness that is sweeping Milan's spring-summer 2006 runways. Her show featured an embarrassment of ruffles and pleats; fabrics including diaphanous chiffon, organza, and fragile laces; and sugar-sweet prints.</p><p>Those frills and flounces gave a kick to the shortest flirty skirts and baby-doll dresses, and volume to draped goddess gowns and garden-party frocks with a thirties flavor. Even the wide-lapel, sharp-tailored blazers and mess jackets (with an echo of seventies Rive Gauche) were softened with frothy jabots; sleek pants were paired with an update of the matinee jacket, flounced in net and lace. Missoni's signature prints and knit weaves ran the gamut from the angular romance of a Poiret-inspired Art Deco floral design to the brilliance of Peruvian stripes that gave punch to the pastels. Also adding voltage were the brightly colored or metallic disc sequins shimmering over short shifts or three-quarter cardigan jackets.</p><p>Less focused than recent offerings from the house, this pan-generational collection nevertheless offered femininity for all ages. A simple beige cardigan, casually slouched over a bias-cut gown, for instance, echoes Angela Missoni's own easy, defiantly anti-fashion style, while those sassy little dresses with flounces well above the knee look destined for her daughter Margherita—herself an inspirational force on the international fashion scene.</p></div>"
97,spring,2006,s2006,miu-miu,"Look to Miu Miu for a quick-fire, instantly wearable synthesis of what's going on in the mind of Miuccia Prada—plus a fantastic array of shoes. Quick on the heels of her main-line thesis on new wider and looser proportions, Prada didn't miss a beat—her Miu Miu collection was right there with the short, roomy, falling-off-the-shoulder dresses and all the big, glittery, Deco-ed up platforms a girl could want.</p><p>The cartoony ideas Prada cited for her signature label turned up as irregular starbursts popping randomly across little A-line dresses in lemon or pink, and then playfully applied to the riveting high-heel platform shoes. Also attracting attention along the way: the big, wide-set solid-black shoulder straps, from which to dangle a summer dress—another crucial seasonal detail directly transmitted from her grown-up show.</p><p>Not to say that Miu Miu was a clone. Its personality was indelibly creased, like the strange results of a botched dry-cleaning job, into its cheerfully cheap lining-fabric surfaces. Neat, inside-out pressed denims, striped shirting coats and smocks, and a trend-hitting passage of sixties dresses and coats in oversize eyelet had their own groove going on, too. Still, let's not pretend: The gorgeously mad, funky footwear was the star of this parade.</p></div>"
98,spring,2006,s2006,monique-lhuillier,"Monique Lhuillier's career has taken flight, which could be one explanation for the decorative bow-tied birdcages that hung above her runway. Following in Vera Wang's footsteps, Lhuillier's clean, pretty, bridal-tinged take on evening is gathering notice and, importantly, red-carpet-caliber customers, who will have plenty of dresses to choose from this spring. The pregnant California-based designer showed a seamless collection of them, starting with a smart white gazar cocktail number with a tuxedo-style halter and building to a showstopping taffeta gown with a voluminous hand-tufted skirt in ""blue haze."" A sleeker stunner was in platinum satin, with cowl detailing at the neckline. Flowing chiffon dresses had narrow jeweled belts at the waist, and a ball skirt with ribbon-embroidered flowers was topped, simply, with a necklace-beaded ivory cashmere shell. The palette was soft, and restraint was an important factor in the success of the collection. Without it, ballerina cocktail dresses dotted with caviar beads, and bodices, straps, and armholes that glittered with crystals, would have been too much. But there wasn't a mistake in the bunch.</p><p>The designer wrote in her program notes that this collection was ""very emotional"" for her, explaining that her expectant state has left her feeling ""reflective, giddy, and passionate."" Her audience seemed to have a similar reaction.</p></div>"
99,spring,2006,s2006,moschino,"Honoring the late Franco Moschino's ""classico con twist"" mantra, the house's creative team continues to serve up serious, well-behaved classics that are always enlivened with a dash of humor. For spring, the Moschino girls stepped through life-size silhouette cutouts that formed the backdrop for their shenanigans in clothes that ransacked the decades. It seemed as though a ponytailed young girl had been let loose on her grandmother's lifetime horde of attic treasures—and had mixed them up with some of her own thrift store <em>trouvailles</em>. She might shrug a shrunken black leather biker's jacket over an oyster satin thirties camisole, or wear her heart-shape Lolita sunglasses with a stiff little sixties A-line evening dress. And how to give a punky edge to those well-behaved chiffon and black lace cocktail frocks? How about clumpy patent platform shoes, licked with fluoro color?</p><p>The collection's inventive trompe l'oeil effects included full-skirt fifties garden-party dresses, their hips swagged with prints of chain-link belts, or a writhing mass of pearl necklaces scattered with the real (faux) thing. And the Moschino team not only succumbed to the season's mania for ruffles (in tiers of Coco Chanel-like sequined black tulle, or a frill peeping from the hem of a rigid dress) —it also parodied it, in the form of a plain swing skirt painted with imagined flounces.</p></div>"
100,spring,2006,s2006,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez shook things up when he moved from his longtime location at the Bryant Park tents to the Exit Art gallery on Tenth Avenue. His collection might have benefited from some subtle reworking, as well. If it isn't broken, it shouldn't be fixed. But the sight of Claire Danes in the front row wearing a lavender tank dress from his resort collection that was terribly similar to several he sent out for spring was not a great omen.</p><p>There were fresh faces in the audience, thanks to the simultaneous launch of his menswear line, and an accompanying sense of anticipation. He delivered on that promise in his women's collection by dropping his skirt lengths a few inches below the knee and outfitting his models with a low wedge sandal. He's turned the page on strictly monochrome dresses, and he played with piecing shades together, like silver, violet, and brown linen stitched into one dress. Other harness-back coats and dresses looked familiar, as did strictly seamed suits, and all lacked the sex appeal that made loyal clients of Danes and Rachel Weisz in the first place.</p><p>What did look fresh were his crystal-encrusted bodices and waistbands, and a pearl-covered net shell worn with a full voile skirt. In a season that's shaping up to be about rich, hand-worked details, these pieces made one long for more, in the form of some full-length gowns equally embellished and luxe.</p></div>"
101,spring,2006,s2006,naum,"Ask the Afghan-German design team behind Naum about what really gets them going, and they'll say fabric. Waleed Khairzada and Julia Jentzsch introduced their Naum collection this spring (they have more than 20 years combined experience at various labels), and their passion for textiles was apparent. ""Intelligent"" material, like antibacterial and sun-protective cotton, was cut and sewn into an oxford-style shirt with a panel of pleats in the back. Lacquered cotton, kimono silk from Japan, and silvery Jacquard are other favorite Naum materials. One deceptively simple dress was a single, selvage-to-selvage piece of black cotton lace, held in place with narrow straps ribbon-tied over a white cotton slip. Khairzada and Jentzsch also like to combine these fabrics in unlikely pairings, experiment with textures, and rethink the placement of something as essential as a seam. Linen culottes were matched with filmy, see-through knits thrown over bandeau tops. A mahogany-brown cocoonlike jacket resembled tree bark. One ""technical wind coat"" with a shawl collar and sports-mesh-lined pockets had an elaborate drawstring construction in the back and revealed the duo's obsession with active sportswear. Combine these unusual details—handy needlework like smocking and intricate origami folds, shown with woven belts and chunky sandals (which the pair also crafted)—then set it to a world-music soundtrack, and the result is a somewhat ethnic, slightly confusing mix. The scene-stealers were the finale dresses, which somehow found a way to make silk chiffon seem casual and effortless, revealing what interesting new forms a fabric can assume when it falls into able hands.</p></div>"
102,spring,2006,s2006,nicolas-andreas-taralis,"Nicolas Andreas Taralis is a relative newcomer whose promise extends far beyond his interesting pedigree (which includes a stint with Hedi Slimane at Dior Homme). Not only was his front row well stocked with prominent editors and retailers, but standing-room guests lined the wall and snaked behind the light rigging all the way to the door—where the clothes, dimly lit to begin with, must have been plenty hard to see.</p><p>In a spring season of multiplying dresses and diminishing returns, the 30-year-old Canadian focused—with rigorous precision—on pantsuits. These he proposed as cropped jackets paired with full trousers complete with front pleats or, in a younger take on the theme, superskinny jeans. They were paired with fine-jersey tees in white and gray, which trailed silvery streamers and sashes.</p><p>A pleated silver lamé dress, strung from the neck halter-style and loosely tied at the waist, showed that Taralis can also do pretty. And as for draping: When he arrived on the scene a year ago, he showed the kind of capes that are just now making their way into other collections. For spring, he's moved on to ponchos. His finale, which was striped with black and silver beads, had the kind of off-hand cool and notice-me luxe that would make a more experienced designer wish he'd thought of it first.</p></div>"
103,spring,2006,s2006,nicole-miller,"After some curious delving in recent seasons into ancient Celtic and Viking themes, Nicole Miller returned to the present for spring. Or at least to a more familiar, not-so-distant past. Backstage after her show at Café St. Bart's on Park Avenue, the designer said she was inspired by the early and late parts of that ever-plundered decade, the sixties. The former was represented by baby-doll dresses with modish bubble skirts and an Empire-waist coat, while the latter turned up in embellishments like crocheted waistbands and shoulder straps on cocktail numbers and gowns, and a colorful geometric scarf print that hinted at Pucci.</p><p>Not everything was retro. There were terrific cuffed shorts, prairie skirts in metallic taffeta, and sweet cotton camisoles, similar to those that pretty young things have been donning all summer. But too much looked borrowed from fashion's current group of It boys. Tulip skirts, intricately seamed bustier dresses, and others with all-too-familiar cutouts looked a lot fresher on the runways last season.</p></div>"
104,spring,2006,s2006,nina-ricci,"When a label is sailing along as smoothly as Lars Nilsson's Nina Ricci, the temptation to stick with familiar formulas is hard to resist. But if the audience, which included the burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, was expecting a reprise of the designer's lingerie-inspired frocks, it was in for a surprise. He instead sent out dresses in crisp men's shirting fabrics. These billowed rather than draped, and came with shoulder straps and Empire-waist bows and belts in thick satin ribbon.</p><p>On a similarly unexpected note, Nilsson proposed seersucker for evening, pairing blue-and-white-striped trousers with a silver sequined shell. What a snappy idea—one that he might have explored further. It would've been interesting to see him use seersucker for, say, a ball skirt, worn with an embellished tank or sweater, or even for a full-blown C.Z. Guest-style gown. Still, the new generation of socialites for whom Nilsson designs will find plenty to love in this collection, from a simple trench in cotton satin to standout suits with bell-shape skirts in cotton drill.</p><p>Of course, romance and the house of Ricci are nearly inseparable, as Nilsson well knows. Thanks to his beautiful color palette of berry red, gold beige, and boreal pink, this show was not without its feminine charms.</p></div>"
105,spring,2006,s2006,oscar-de-la-renta,"After last season's Russian sojourn, Oscar de la Renta returned to his Latin roots for spring. And why shouldn't he? In the 40 years he's been in business (he celebrated the anniversary this year), regular flamenco infusions have served him well.</p><p>With the Williams sisters, Eva Longoria, Candace Bushnell, and Donald and Melania Trump watching from the front row, de la Renta played to his strengths: flounces galore, toreador jackets, and a spicy palette of marigold, red, and warm neutrals, often finished off with a smattering of crystal embroidery. For day, wooden beading at the hip or contrast piping along seams gave classic silhouettes a sprightly flare, but beige linen suits and bouclé tweeds won't disappoint his faithful league of ladies.</p><p>As for eveningwear, Oscar gave the women what they want, from knee-length Audrey Hepburn black sheaths to a taffeta Empire gown painted with watercolor blossoms. For occasions that call for something in between, he did silk chiffon halter-neck dresses, with daring keyhole cutouts. He even reprised last season's T-shirt and ball skirt on Jacquetta Wheeler. Yes, there were many commercial moments, which isn't a bad thing. But at 75 looks, the show could've used some editing. All told, an Oscar collection is like a trip to the Prado. Faced with such an embarrassment of riches, it's too easy to miss the many fine things.</p></div>"
106,spring,2006,s2006,paul-smith,"Did that jolly good chap Paul Smith spend his summer fitting in a bit of work while glued to the cricket on TV? Why not? That's exactly what every other red-blooded British male was up to these past months when (as the rest of the world may not have noticed) England thrashed Australia in the Ashes, for the first time in, oh, <em>yonks</em>. At any rate, that's one excuse for the cricket whites—big cotton cable-knit sweaters and baggy pants—that turned up in his summer collection, albeit in girlish shapes and with saucy details, like satin and lace underwear, doodled in along the way.</p><p>It's nice to see Smith so relaxed designing clothes for women. A menswear designer first, it took a while for him to get into what now comes naturally: making stuff an uncomplicated bloke could fancy a good girl wearing. Thus, there was a lot of mild fantasy play going on around what a girlfriend might look like in a man's bib-front shirt, say, or perhaps a virginal, cut-work linen nightie over boxer shorts. After that, the reverie floated on to summery smocks and sprigged floral prints ideal for garden parties and, with a bit of luck, a little hanky-panky behind the bushes. It's all harmless, clean living fun, of course. Nothing much to do with the busy, thrusting thoroughfares of fashion progress either—but that's exactly what Paul Smith has dedicated himself to avoiding.</p></div>"
107,spring,2006,s2006,peter-jensen,"He put up bunting. He played Loretta Lynn and Elvis. And his models stepped onto the platform, hair in plaited updos, faces and limbs covered with freckles, looking like unspoiled girls at a country fair sometime in the mid-sixties. An unusual vision for a shy man who grew up in a fishing village in the inaccessible north of Denmark, but with its gawky charm, idealized perspective, and idolization of unlikely heroines, it is the world of Peter Jensen.</p><p>The collection, it transpired, was the designer's mash note to Sissy Spacek in movies from <em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em> to <em>Carrie</em> to <em>Badlands</em>. His Sissy girls wore checked cotton smocks, Girl Scout uniforms, red denim overall dresses, and gawky little knits sequined with farmyard motifs. For prom, they'd worked dutifully on their home dressmaking patterns and came out wearing simple white frocks lovingly embellished with plastic beads.</p><p>Innocent yet gently spoofy, Jensen's love for deliberately unsexy clothes runs directly counter to the prevailing culture of reality TV and celebrity overkill. He has a growing fan base that admires his clean, innocent, and Scandinavian sensibility that, as it turns out, includes Spacek herself, who sent Jensen a thrilled e-mail. ""I got a real kick out of hearing the news about the Sissy collection,"" she told him. ""All I can imagine are little, cotton, country shirtwaist dresses, from all areas of the American South."" Exactly right. And just to make this a happy ending, she's asked him to make her a dress.</p></div>"
108,spring,2006,s2006,peter-som,"With the Ingmar Bergman film <em>Fanny and Alexander</em> and a summer at Fire Island as his chief inspirations, Peter Som crafted a spring collection that had both Victorian and nautical motifs. What seem like disparate themes came together to form ""a crisp, clean, light feeling, but romantic too,"" said Som backstage. And he was right. First out was a linen dress with crewel work gracing its high neck and above-the-knee hem. That silhouette reappeared elsewhere in the show, but it worked especially well in delicate white Chantilly lace, thanks to a black slip that gave it a welcome edge.</p><p>His sailor-girl jackets, culottes, and pleated skirts in twill, silk broadcloth, and seersucker were sweet through and through. Seafarer or landlubber, his clients will want to add long navy cashmere voile cardigans and vests to their wardrobes. One wide-leg sailor pant bordered on clownish, and his blue and gold brocades looked a bit too mature for the social set that lined his front row, but those were minor missteps. After a series of linen evening gowns dusted with crystals or painted with flowers in a manner that Som described as ""neither overwrought nor precious,"" they were easy to forgive.</p></div>"
109,spring,2006,s2006,phi,"Three seasons into his tenure at Phi, designer Andreas Melbostad had developed a reputation as a bit of a goth. He had a penchant for black, structural minimalism, and last season, punky winkle pickers. This spring, he shed his darker side with an explosion of color, inspired by a red-and-fuchsia Warhol self-portrait. This bold breakthrough was a pleasant surprise that placed Phi in line with the prevailing trends of the week, and shed new light on Melbostad's strengths.</p><p>The balance between hard and soft is of recurring interest to the designer, and this season, the scales tipped toward a gentler, bow-tied femininity. The collection was a study of neat bodice-defining dresses with variations on decoration (sixties-inspired floral prints and embroideries), fabrics (tuxedo wool, stretch twill, Swiss cotton organdy), and construction techniques (pleats and tiers for fullness). Wide, hard patent leather belts introduced some tough love into the collection. The contrast between Melbostad's youthful dresses and strong-shoulder jackets that featured curved back seams (a Melbostad signature in the making) was grown-up and sophisticated. Abbreviated leather motorcycle jackets, despite their intriguing color piping and ""rip trim,"" worked better in theory than in practice.</p><p>Slim pants added to the collection's body-conscious neatness, and tailored separates with luscious bows had exaggerated proportions. Box-pleated skirts and skorts were blooming, as was a floral print designed in-house. A scoop-neck balloon jacket, puff shorts, and a bow-front halter worn by Hana Soukupova were the antithesis of goth, and designed to be noticed in a very different, fabulous kind of way.</p></div>"
110,spring,2006,s2006,philosophy,"Tousled urchin cuts and tiny, innocent shifts swung Alberta Ferretti's Philosophy show in a cute, sixties, Mary Quant-ish direction. White laundered Peter Pan collars—some of them tied on slightly askew as separate accessories—turned up on the necklines of cream knit and crochet dresses, flower-printed smocks, shirtwaists, and undone chiffon blouses, all of which looked borrowed from a 14-year-old Twiggy or the pages of an early Biba catalog.</p><p>Whatever the season's ostensible theme, though, nothing gets in the way of Philosophy's mission to deliver its pretty stock of signature dresses to the girls. So, while breezing past the sixties with some little white cotton raincoats and silver shorts, it also had interpretations of twenties, thirties, and forties frocks, not to mention a timely nod toward Empire nighties. It's a forgivable habit. Ferretti has many winning ways with charmeuse, cutwork, and fluttery chiffon that give her second collection almost as many attractions as her first.</p></div>"
111,spring,2006,s2006,pollini,"Rifat Ozbek put a spin on the current upward shift of the waistline by thinking <em>toreador!</em> instead of Empress Josephine. Such skewering furnished a fresh device for the opening of his spring Pollini show: a grayish raised-waist silk dress decorated with silver fringed bullfighter embroidery that, on closer inspection, turned out to be made of bunches of safety pins. The Andalusian cross-reference also provided a neat solution for bolero jackets and cropped pants, as well as fluttery-topped double-layered blouses with ingeniously pretty big-shoulder, narrow-torso silhouettes.</p><p>Details like fine black lace on nude wool brought a new lightness of touch to a show that has sometimes erred on the side of stodginess. Curvy black dresses with a dash of Moorish ribbon embroidery provided aficionados with a flashback to the form that gave Ozbek his first accolades in the eighties. Those good vibes didn't quite manage to sustain the show to the end, though; the Miró-esque teardrop Jacquards looked a tad heavy. Nevertheless, with its lace and woven leather shoes by Georgina Goodman, and funny straw picador hats by Philip Treacy, this was Ozbek's best stab at Pollini so far.</p></div>"
112,spring,2006,s2006,prada,"""I wanted to go forward by trying to cancel out nostalgia. By canceling out the body,"" said Miuccia Prada. She opened her search for new proportions with a big, loose, odd-looking overshirt, pulled over thick gray stockings. It wasn't exactly a shock, in the way Prada can sometimes be, but the impact of this show, with its strange whitewashed textures and oddly chosen combinations of gigantic platforms, high-heel gladiator boots, bamboo-sole wedges, and big shiny crocodile status bags, was hard to call. Was it fresh, plain, and girlish, or layered with high-tech innovations and original thought? Well, all of the above, naturally. Throwing people off the easy explanation is what Mrs. Prada does.</p><p>Clean-skinned girls, neatly ponytailed and cyclamen-lipped, some of them with shiny patent eyeshades, opened the show wheeling stacks of luggage—the baggage of the Prada family heritage. The clothes—mainly dresses that fit loosely, denying the waist—seemed like velvet at first glance, but proved to be made of a kind of overprinted linen. A sequence of deflated puffed sleeves, outcrops of kilt pleats, and floppy falling-down shoulder lines looked borrowed from school uniforms, but without their requisite cuteness.</p><p>If Mrs. Prada has an impulse to stride toward the future, though, she knows she can't go there without taking along the much-loved souvenirs of the past. Her plain lawn dresses incorporated the cutwork details of finely crafted tablecloths found in old Italian specialist shops. And for evening, she reverted to type, using minute wooden beads and strips of antiqued diamanté as decoration. All that looked simply lovely. Which leaves the explanations to another day.</p></div>"
113,spring,2006,s2006,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"It's amazing how few British designers manage to lift their eyes to the modern London horizon, and feel great about it. But there was a rare, serene sensation of nowness running through Preen's spring show. In the spiraling atrium of the new mayor's City Hall, with a sunny view of the Tower of London across the Thames, Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton sent out a cool collection of drapey, dusty pinks and pearly beiges that ramped up their reputation to another level.</p><p>It looked as if the down-and-dirty, ragpicker experimentalism of this pair's early career had been put through the laundry several thousand times and emerged cleaner, softer, and infinitely more refined. What they learned from cutting up old sweatshirts and discovering a million ways to torture an old man's suit hasn't been lost. Now it's being channeled into sophisticated, lightly layered shirts, cool, cuffed shorts, and wrapped dresses, cocktail bustiers, and cummerbunds made from stretch jersey. Their deft handling of luxurious materials like washed satin marked another step forward. If there's a criticism, it's that Preen doesn't need to show so many looks. After ten minutes, they'd already won their argument for grown-up cool, hands down.</p></div>"
114,spring,2006,s2006,proenza-schouler,"So much for minimalism. Not that Proenza Schouler's Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough have ever endorsed austerity, but after this duo's Arts and Crafts-inflected spring collection, the much buzzed-about trend may be dead in the water. Working in a shadowy palette of black, gray, silver, and white, the designers established a restricted silhouette: Skirts were midcalf length and slightly full at the hips and thighs, while pants were narrow and tapered. Tops, except for a few new riffs on their signature bustiers and bodysuits, had volume, as did jackets. Coats, primarily, were trim.</p><p>Now, here's the fun part: Openwork embroidery decorated the bust line of their first exit, a wheat linen dress, and from there, the crewel work, brocade, and passementerie just kept coming. Puff-sleeve gauze tops with ruffled necklines looked like instant hits, as did two jackets, one in silver burlap and the other in charcoal silk, that both buttoned up the back. A chartreuse silk velvet coat was too Sgt. Pepper to be user-friendly, but in smoke with white embroidery, it's a guaranteed collector's item. Dana Lorenz's ropey necklaces worked well with the boys' delicate clothes. As for the duo's stacked-heel sandals, they were clean, modern counterpoints to all that embellishment, which could at times seem bulky. Taken separately, there were plenty of lovely pieces that Proenza Schouler's fans—some of whom looked desperately for the diaphanous finale gowns, which never arrived—will no doubt want to claim as their new favorites.</p></div>"
115,spring,2006,s2006,project-alabama,"Their fifth year in business has been a banner one for Project Alabama's Natalie Chanin and Enrico Marone-Cinzano. They were nominated for the 2005 Fashion Design Award from New York's Cooper-Hewitt museum and were named finalists for the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund award. With all of this attention comes increased scrutiny. And now that UPS has sponsored the label's first-ever runway show, a bevy of editorial and retail heavy hitters have turned up to find out what the buzz is about.</p><p>To meet the challenge, Chanin's Florence, Ala.-based quilters kicked things up a notch, adding a high-tech material with a sexy drape to the mostly cotton jersey lineup, and incorporating elaborate beadwork and airbrushing into their repertoire. Some pieces—a saffron coat reverse-appliquéd in a deeper shade and heavily embroidered with golden beads comes to mind—would make the finest <em>petits mains</em> in Paris <em>vert</em> with envy. But this was Project Alabama's New York fashion week debut, and the moment seems to belong to minimalism, so there were also fitted cardigans devoid of handiwork and full skirts decorated only with narrow vertical bands of contrasting cross-stitching. A few of the colors appeared too ""country"" from the bleachers of the Bryant Park tents, but Chanin's navy-and-black combinations looked great and, trend-wise, were spot on.</p></div>"
116,spring,2006,s2006,paco-rabanne,"So much for the sophomore slump. Paco Rabanne's Patrick Robinson dispensed of the notion entirely with a strong spring collection that paid homage to the heritage of the house, without risking its sense of the present tense. To accomplish this elusive feat, Robinson ordered 500 vintage silk kimonos from a textile dealer, sliced them up, and pieced them together with metal and plastic discs, like Rabanne once did. In the stores, no two dresses will look alike, because all the fabrics are antique. That should appeal to the kind of cool girl with funds to spare for whom he's designing, as will his slim, stovepipe pants, short tulip skirts, and sporty yet sexy racer-back tanks.</p><p>Robinson evoked the house's rich history in other ways, too, starting with his silhouette. Dresses were all above the knee; some draped from Empire waists, while others were A-line. Elsewhere, he experimented with fabrics with a futuristic look. Short shorts were cut from a stiff gold mesh that looked practically bulletproof, and the black bodice of a drop-waist feather-hemmed shift rippled like water. One editor suggested that Robinson's knowing mix of the old and the new, of East and West, makes him an apt candidate to design wardrobes for the next installment of Quentin Tarantino's <em>Kill Bill</em> series. Until then, he's focusing on moving the house forward; otherwise, as he said backstage, it's all just costumes.</p></div>"
117,spring,2006,s2006,ralph-lauren,"At Ralph Lauren, last season's Old Hollywood, <em>Aviator</em>-style high glamour took a backseat to a more relaxed brand of chic. Gone are the silk charmeuses, hourglass suits, and bugle beads, and in their place are charms of a more rustic nature: denim, serapes, and hand-painted decoration. ""Freewheeling"" is how the designer described his collection, and he drove that point home by coming out for his bow in well-used sneakers and jeans.</p><p>He began with a series of navy jackets in a nautical theme, including a Sgt. Pepper style that divided the audience—some loved its gold bullion embroidery; others didn't. These were paired with classic linen pants and shorts or georgette skirts in white. From there, Lauren moved on to skirtsuits in crisp, mismatched shirting stripes. Interspersed throughout were eyelet and lace, in keeping with the season's trends, and other items—a horse-blanket poncho, a patchwork jacket, thrashed and embellished jeans—that were distinctly Ralph.</p><p>For evening, he took the menswear fabrics he knows so well and shirred, ruched, and ruffled them to create sweet but seductive shapes. More of that gold bullion appeared on a swishy cocktail number, but a gown made from yard after yard of embroidered white tulle was the show's real stunner.</p></div>"
118,spring,2006,s2006,ralph-rucci,"For Ralph Rucci's loyal fans, his fashion shows are an occasion to dress, <em>really</em> dress. Once there, coiffed and bejeweled, they let their appreciation be known, clapping and exclaiming over his talent. Rucci is an exacting designer devoted to the craft. The workmanship of his clothes is apparent, though his silhouettes rarely change. His consistency lends the subtlest new twists more impact, like the nuances he has given an alligator bodice, a pieced dress, or a voluminous coat.</p><p>For spring, Rucci played with leather and printed organza, which were peeking through seams and under skirts. A putty-color suit was made of leather and suede so carefully braided that it resembled fabric. A series of dresses with ""scratch embroidery"" were made of the thinnest pieces of leather sewn on tulle in a moiré-like pattern. Metallic leather insets on suits and dresses were particularly effective on a copper dress on Noot Seear. Rucci updated his signature double-faced wool crepe dresses with French knots and streamers on the straps. The freshest looks were the simplest. Caroline Winberg modeled a surprisingly youthful white silk jersey blouse and silk shantung skirt with an asymmetric hem. A black cocktail dress with a drape at center front and center back was timeless. Two gowns stood out: One, in ombré silk chiffon, had a shark-tooth-shaped leather piece attached at the bodice in the back, and another (the showstopper) was a column of alabaster silk crepe cut on the bias with an attached scarf flowing from the neck, dramatic enough for Isadora Duncan.

119,spring,2006,s2006,richard-chai-love,"The trends are finally catching up with Richard Chai, who is a devout minimalist. His spring collection was a continuation of themes he has been developing over the past two seasons and had a uniquely appealing preppy-meets-Asian vibe.</p><p>First, the Asian part: Origami tailoring techniques, which have become a Chai signature, were visible from the very start, with hopsack trousers with the waistband folded over to reveal a dot voile lining, and skirts turned up at the hem in a triangle shape to show their undersides. Chai's belts were where the two worlds, collegiate classic and Eastern, collided beautifully. While they were intricately folded (some veiled in tulle), they were also tied in big bows over topstitched marine-color trousers and pleated skirts, some worn with cropped blazers.</p><p>""Lately, clothes have been so opulent; I was aiming for something understated,"" Chai said backstage. He did give in to some decorative impulses. Embroidery, in the form of loosely sketched floral patterns, was scattered across skirts, pants, and on a white trench coat. Several tops had crystal necklace embroidery, as did the hem of a pleated sundress.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""geqb39""></div></div><p>The strong eighties shoulder Chai favors was back again, just a little bit softer. It's not in keeping with the season's trends, but he may be onto something. While the layering was occasionally heavy, a moss-green taffeta trench and a khaki-and-cyclamen T-shirtdress that were gathered and simply tied in a knot in the front had the restraint and ease Chai was after, and accomplished.</p></div>"
120,spring,2006,s2006,rick-owens,"The artillery fire on Rick Owens' soundtrack was a bit misleading. Despite the powdery white faces, thick-soled boots, and fondness for a drab palette, his army of goth girls looked less militaristic and dour than in the past. And they were more on trend, especially in slender, bias-cut chiffon gowns with vaguely thirties silhouettes.</p><p>The designer has developed a large cult following and a healthy retail business on the slimming power of his jackets, and his spring collection delivers plenty of them. Some were shown in his signature washed leather. A few had slashes in the back and were tied at the side, and still others displayed precision tailoring, elaborately pieced together from leather, silk, and pleated net and worn over another Owens' staple: the drapey tee.</p><p>Trousers cut in too-sheer georgette exposed inner workings like seams, pocket linings, and zipper plackets. Full chiffon pants were pleated in a zigzag manner that created bulk and drew attention to the backside, hips, and thighs, areas that even his sylphlike fans would often rather downplay. And a few hobble skirts proved too restrictive for even the most nimble of his models. But those missteps couldn't distract from his masterful jackets and vests with lapels of buttercup patent leather, lizard, and shagreen that blossomed like flowers. When Owens stepped out of character, as he did with a sleeveless, long wrap dress made from eyelet (in gray, but still), he really dazzled.</p></div>"
121,spring,2006,s2006,roberto-cavalli,"The set for Roberto Cavalli's spring show included an elaborate tented poolside cabana in black-and-white stripes, shaded by palm trees and placed at the edge of a runway printed with a swimming pool's ripples. It evoked a location that Slim Aarons, legendary chronicler of the rich at play, photographed in Palm Beach in the sixties. And all the giddy opulence of that manicured islet was reflected in his briskly paced show.</p><p>Moving with the speed of gazelles pursued by cheetah prints, Cavalli's regiment of high-stepping glamazons was dressed for a trip to Giorgio Beverly Hills, circa Dynasty vintage, in an Alexis Colby take on patriotic red, white, and blue. By Cavalli's standards, a gold sequined blazer worn with lean, deck-chair-stripe cotton pants is the last word in daytime understatement. As is a clear plastic trench elaborately pinstriped in velvet appliqué, or a ""jean"" jacket in plastic and ruby alligator. After dusk, of course, the Cavalli girl really lets rip, in jewel-fringed shimmy frocks or barely-there drifts of ombré chiffon in the colors of tropical sunsets. A silk gingham crinoline dress seemed relatively prim—until its skirts opened to reveal the microshorts underneath. (These have looked unconvincing on other runways, but will surely find a place in the heart and wardrobe of the fearless Cavalli gal.)</p><p>The sheer, outrageous courage of Cavalli's convictions allows him to filter and shake up influences and make them all his own—even when he's ransacking the archives of the design greats for details. This season, those included Valentino's sixties giraffe prints and Yves Saint Laurent's one-shoulder, multistriped, ruffled chiffon dresses from the seventies and eighties.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""jfwhiw""></div></div><p>Who but Cavalli himself, however, could send out a finale parade of sequined black-and-white swimsuits—surely designed with the pool boy rather than the pool in mind?</p></div>"
122,spring,2006,s2006,rochas,"A black pantsuit, paired with a shiny black miniaturized violin case for a bag: That's the news at Rochas. This was the first time Olivier Theyskens has shown a pair of trousers on this runway, marking another small step forward in his unhurried nurturing of the brand. With their slightly crumpled surfaces—as if dried after a sprinkling of rain—these pantsuits belong, for Theyskens, to the same poetic vision that embraces his long gowns, skirts, and high-neck blouses. ""I felt it was time to do them,"" he said. ""But I treated them with a <em>flou</em>, like I work the rest.""</p><p>""The rest"" related back to the attenuated, romantic Edwardian silhouette that appeared in his winter collection. This season, the impressionistic sources of his precious dresses were Claude Monet's paintings of his garden at Giverny—and faded sepia photographs of the lace-collared blouses, small jackets, and long skirts worn by the sculptor Camille Claudel, the wildly beautiful young lover and muse of Auguste Rodin.</p><p>The most-obvious clues to the designer's elusive references were water lily embroideries blossoming on gowns, but he executed his ideas with such subtlety that the chiffon surfaces of a deep-blue dress and the streaming flare of a pleated train seemed to flow like water. As for Claudel, she had to be the moving spirit behind the pale, off-white and mushroom-tinted dresses and the ruffled lace capelet-sleeve gown that was the collection's showstopper.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ok1ct9""></div></div><p>Theyskens is more one to hint than hammer at a theme, though. All one really needs to glean from this season is that it's a gentle, lingering development of the ideas of a designer who resists external pressures to rush headlong from one thing to the next.</p></div>"
123,spring,2006,s2006,rodarte,"Rodarte's inauspicious time slot—9 p.m. on the first Friday of New York fashion week—was complicated by a late start. All was forgiven, though, once the models took the stage at the StyleLounge. The sophomore collection of Pasadena, California-based sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy belied not only their ages, 26 and 24, but also their lack of professional design training. Inspired by what they described as their ""youth in Northern California's Muir Woods and 1960's sculptural forms,"" one gown boasted a harlequin-like pattern of crisscrossing strips of ""moon-kissed"" silvery satin that resembled bark. A floor-grazing column skirt was made entirely from fluttery rectangles of grayish chiffon. And another dress was adorned with undulating waves of their signature pinked-edge silk. In other words, the Mulleavys are keeping their couture seamstresses very busy.</p><p>No doubt stylists will be busy, too, requesting Rodarte's pieces for their famous clients. These are the kind of dressy, urbane occasion clothes—hand-finished with lovely, subtle details—that will help a young starlet differentiate herself from the overdone, glitzed-up masses. And it's a good thing, too. With prices ranging from $3,000 to $11,000, having a celebrity-size checkbook is practically required.</p></div>"
124,spring,2006,s2006,roksanda,"A Serb from the former Yugoslavia, Roksanda Ilincic settled in London and, for the past five years, has been working away at the margins of the fashion scene. What began as a hard-to-understand art-house operation given to wild prints and overstated shapes has now settled into something resembling a dressy evening collection. And this season, Ilincic's perseverance has at last earned her a place on the official London calendar.</p><p>At a breakfast show at Terence Conran's Bibendum restaurant, she demonstrated how well she's learned to temper her richly romantic Eastern European sensibility—if not her penchant for big shapes. She opened with a vast black and gold brocade trapeze dress with a deep puffy hem. That, along with an oversize flounced opera coat in vibrant purple silk, presented an interestingly crazed overstatement of 1950's elegance.</p><p>Something in those two pretend-couture outfits looked convincingly personal. The rest, though they qualify as pretty, au courant party dresses, some studded with Poiret-esque fabric roses, owed too much to last year's Lanvin to stand up as very original.</p></div>"
125,spring,2006,s2006,roland-mouret,"""Is it the girl, or is it the gown?"" Cole Porter once asked. Roland Mouret, who was listening to the famously witty lyricist as he prepared his collection, had a firm answer: It's both. Willowy models were transformed into statuesque, soigné characters, with gowns molded to their bodies and side-swept chignons, every bit as chic as the cast of <em>The Women,</em> another of the designer's touchstones.</p><p>In this collection, presented at Skylight Studios, Mouret took up where he left off last season, toying with elongated hourglass shapes. Carmen Kass opened the show in an ivory suit with three-quarter sleeves and a dramatic, somewhat clerical collar. Silky skirts had fishtails, and one that was paired with a halter top was a selvage-to-selvage wrap. As much as Mouret's tailoring savvy was on display, the no-sew approach that launched his career was evident. Dresses were draped so ingeniously, through a system of tucks and small seams, they seemed to be effortlessly anchored to the body. Patterns that revealed a patch of skin—on a shoulder or the back—added unexpected sizzle to Mouret's slightly retro styling. Full trousers in charcoal checks and plaids with hefty cuffs stood out among the skirts and gowns, and created the illusion of endless legs. The green tops worn with them were a little jarring, but overall, Mouret's vivid palette was outstanding. The finale was a Pop Art blur of green, teal, orange, yellow, and pink. And Vlada closed the show in a red-and-pink color-blocked gown that would have made Mr. Porter think twice before he answered that question.</p></div>"
126,spring,2006,s2006,saint-laurent,"Stefano Pilati, the man who emerged from the backroom at YSL Rive Gauche, now has the fashion world waiting with bated breath on his every belt and ruffle. For spring, that waist-cinching belt—the fulcrum of his silhouette—came in woven straw, and the ruffles, once applied to peplums and bustles, were trained to burst from shirt bibs and cascade in bands down the front of his narrow skirts. Pilati's opening look was a pair of matador pants, a frilled shirt and a belt—voilà: Spanish. But, as so often this season, you had to check the ultramodern shoes to get the crucial slant: assertively dramatic metallic platforms with triangular heels sculpted into a steep ridge at the back, like the hull of an ocean liner.</p><p>The backstory here is that Pilati spent last summer researching Picasso, mulling over Saint Laurent's 1976 Spanish collection, and adding random insights triggered by his preview of the Dada exhibition that opened this week at the Pompidou Centre. ""I wanted something more spontaneous and passionate,"" he said, ""with a bit of the industrial."" The designer fused all those influences into a confident reiteration of his dressed-up, long-legged, nouveau-French look, drenched in rich color treatments that ran from subtle Cubist shades of beige, ochre, saffron, and black, through to bull's-blood red, purple, and pristine white. Skirts might come cropped above the knee; as long, thigh-clinging pencils; or with a bubbled volume, caught into a narrow flounce; and were balanced with neat, short jackets and a myriad variations on his incredible blouses.</p><p>This season, Pilati brought a new lightness to his intense interest in surface detail. He compressed the idea of black mantilla lace into spidery-fine trompe l'oeil embroidery that covered a crisp white pencil skirt, and traced the shoulder and neckline of a sheer organdy blouse. Chiffon pompoms bobbled along the flanks of skirts and the edges of the bride's slim white cape, and even some of the bags caught the aerated mood—little boxes made of filigree metal in a Moorish screen pattern. If there was any remaining doubt about the attraction of Pilati's rigorous look, it was comprehensively countermanded by the gathering of fans who had turned up wearing his extreme platforms—the runaway hit of YSL's fall collection. Judging by the chat in the excited crowd afterward, the lines for his bold Dada-moderne shoes are already forming.</p></div>"
127,spring,2006,s2006,sari-gueron,"Has Sari Gueron arrived? Has she crossed the threshold from promising newcomer into style establishment? Those uncertain of her fate when they turned up Saturday afternoon at the New Space had only to glance at the front row to make up their minds. Sofia Coppola, the director, muse to Marc Jacobs, and icon to many, chatted with her mother, Eleanor, as she waited for the lights to dim. Coppola's verdict, ""very pretty,"" was seconded by a long line of well-wishers waiting to congratulate the Israel-born, Connecticut-bred designer after her first runway show.</p><p>Having focused in previous seasons on party dresses, primarily of the floaty, romantic variety, Gueron branched out for spring into daywear. She showed of-the-moment cardigan jackets and pleated gauchos, as well as adorable drop-waist dresses in breezy cotton-silk that looked just right with flat sandals. For evening, she dressed up the same material with rosettes dotted with Swarovski crystals or tassels that trimmed necklines and functioned as belts. An abstract rose print that decorated a cotton voile gown and knee-length cocktail dress married her twin inspirations of Art Nouveau and English gardens. ""I usually don't do so much embellishment,"" Gueron explained of one gray cotton gown with a smattering of matte black sequins near the hem. ""But it's still edgy and true to my style."" Which should keep hip, young women like Coppola and her following coming back for more.</p></div>"
128,spring,2006,s2006,sinha-stanic,"In the London arena of newborn talent, it's hard to refrain from the gladiatorial treatment—thumbs up, thumbs down—of young designers. Those who know where they're going straight out the gate are rare indeed. And the rush to judgment is especially hard on a pair who are only dipping their feet into their second season—and whose aesthetic, like Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic's, is particularly subtle.</p><p>Their collection disconcerts, not because of the usual shock tactics, but the opposite: For a couple of twentysomethings, it's almost precociously grown-up. Opening with a loose white shirt, narrow, papery white pants, and flat, monkish white leather sandals, the pair set out a low-key agenda of soft, sporty minimalism. Their look combines neat trenches (a persistent London theme), jersey dresses gently wrapped to an Empire shape, and others in double layers of café au lait tulle.</p><p>There was nothing to argue with here, but there was nothing to surprise and delight, either, which is understandable if Sinha-Stanic is trying to hit upon a nonscary sort of commerciality. Seen on a rail, their clothes radiate woman-friendly wearability; projecting that into a show is altogether trickier. What they need to make clear next season is that they're not heading toward a zone in the marketplace that's so safe it's boring.</p></div>"
129,spring,2006,s2006,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki's spring collection, particularly the first passage, was a personal best from a young Greek obsessed with conquering the technical and aesthetic challenges of making beautiful draped dresses with a modern sensibility. In a season when flesh-tinted tulle and off-white lace have been flying everywhere, hers were standouts, worked with a self-taught lightness of hand she's achieved through many a hard night's pinning and sewing in her East End London studio.</p><p>The trick is to make all the effort look easy, and she injected an off-hand appeal into the delicate layers of a frisée shoulder line, the volume of a caught-up hem and strands of chiffon crafted into a see-through band in a skirt. The experience she's putting into the subtleties of structure and decoration are also paying off. Some of her pieces are weighted with boning invisibly inserted into hems to give a slight bob and bounce in movement. Others come with free-floating garlands of lace casually wound into necklines in place of jewelry.</p><p>As a nod to the season's fugitive colors, Kokosalaki chose pale neutrals, optic white, eau de nil, tints of mauve, and her favorite spectrum of dusty pinks. Still, what really matters is the attitude of her most successful dresses. Kokosalaki knows that coming across like you've tried too hard is always uncool. That principle, combined with her growing confidence in execution, adds up to a signature of her own.</p></div>"
130,spring,2006,s2006,stella-mccartney,"It's easy to see Stella McCartney's progress through the seasons in terms of a young woman's life stages. First, there was the student, picking her way through market stalls in search of vintage lingerie and old men's tailoring. Then came the club years, up dancing all night. Next, whoa: love, marriage, a baby carriage—and before you know it, back to work, a changed person.</p><p>Her collection notes, channeling words like ""easy,"" ""relaxed,"" and ""inner confidence,"" certainly seemed to reflect a new state of grown-up serenity. Judging by the clothes she showed here, it involves thinking about the need for a sporty pantsuit—a go-to-work brass-buttoned blazer and a smart pair of pants. Oh, and let's see, a breezy oversize shirtdress to pull on double-quick with a pair of heels, and out the door. Plus, something simple, like a sharp-chic bustier dress, to jump into while feeding the baby—and on to dinner.</p><p>As all the above made clear, McCartney's come a long way in thinking through what her clothes are meant to do for her peer group. Her choice of color and print caught the general season's drift of whites, pale blues and grays, and art-based patterns (in her case, inspired by Jeff Koons), but she wasn't stressing over being über trendy. What she's doing now doesn't make the headline-grabbing class of directional fashion, but maybe that's a conscious decision. Like all young moms, she's reached the point where the woman separates from the girl.</p></div>"
131,spring,2006,s2006,stephen-burrows,"Thirty-odd years ago, give or take a season, Stephen Burrows was <em>the man.</em> He starred with Jaclyn Smith in his own fragrance ad. He had a boutique at Henri Bendel. And the likes of Grace Jones, Jerry Hall, and Pat Cleveland were gallivanting around Studio 54, no doubt, in his body-hugging designs. Cleveland is still gallivanting, this time in the front row of Burrows' show at the Robert Miller Gallery. ""His clothes are like butterfly wings. I feel so free,"" said Cleveland, who is still keeping good company. Alongside her were Valentino's Carlos de Souza, members of the band Elefant, satirist Fran Lebowitz, Lily Atherton, curator Thelma Golden, and director Jamie Johnson, providing substantial evidence that Burrows is still, after some time out of the limelight, very much a relevant fashion presence today.</p><p>For his Spring collection, Rio de Janeiro furnished the creative fodder for flirty dresses, some with keyhole necklines, wrapped or with godets in celadon, chalk white, and cerise red. Burrows has always been inspired by the way clothes move on the body, so it's no surprise that his fabric of choice is jersey. This time, his signature lettuce edging was reimagined as tendrils of seaweed, delicately cascading around necklines and down torsos. The mostly solid collection was livened up by zigzag stitches in red, as on a black minidress worn by Cameron Russell, and pastel Charlie Brown-style chevron inserts. Prints by RCA grad Ben Copperwheat of Curb Studio added spice, while crystal and bead embellishments gave the finale pieces flash.</p><p>Even before the models started their parade, it was clear that Burrows has resumed his stride. His post-seventies business was as flat as day-old Champagne (despite the inspiration his work has given a younger generation of designers, such as Marc Jacobs), but no more. All of these years later, Burrows said that he is ""more open to new things and outside influences on his work."" And so are we.</p></div>"
132,spring,2006,s2006,strenesse,"The seating chart at a Bryant Park show can often look like the United Nations' roll call. There's an international set that grows with each fashion week, and it's not just in the front row. Foreign designers, too, are warming to Gotham. This season, Munich-based Strenesse (once on the Milan schedule) followed Wolfgang Joop's Wunderkind line to the Big Apple.</p><p>Gabriele Strehle presented in the tents 37 looks that aimed for a ""romantic minimalism,"" which was achieved in the muted palette (cream, khaki, peach, gold) and fabric choices, particularly lace, organza, and cotton tulle. Filmy dresses with Empire lines had a certain charm. As a whole, though, Strehle overreached with this collection, which was as unfocused as the soundtrack (one minute Antony and the Johnsons, the next Judy Collins). Menswear pieces, such as lamé trousers and pants with decorative wallet chains, were, in short, naff. Proportions were too varied: Trench-style boleros mingled with extra-long suit jackets; crystal and beaded man-style oxfords were overdone; and the almost-neon taffeta flower prints appeared to be grown in a radioactive garden. Strehle hit the mark with a layered skirt with plissé hem and a double-breasted navy organza trenchcoat that was just right for a rainy New York day.</p></div>"
133,spring,2006,s2006,tao,"How absolutely delightful it is to see a small, perfectly formed collection, conceived in a flash of inspiration, that happens to make complete sense. What was that flash of inspiration? In a word: handkerchiefs. Or, more specifically, trenchcoats made of meltingly beautiful fine lawn and lace handkerchiefs—an overlooked anachronism that a 32-year-old designer named Tao Kurihara happened one day to pick up, turn in her hand, and marvel at.</p><p>Did she have a cold, on that day in Tokyo? No matter, the happy incident set her off on a mission to find all the most beautiful examples of hankies she could collect: some Chinese, in hand-embroidered broderie anglaise with scalloped edges; some Japanese, cross-stitched with minute bunches of violets; some in Swiss voile, with monograms in the corner; and many more. Then she pieced all the squares together and came up with a little collection of summer raincoats and T-shirts gorgeous enough to make members of the audience consider staging a smash-and-grab raid on the spot.</p><p>In a Paris season heavy on the frilly romance, Tao's version makes for a sweet but cool counterpoint. And as fashion once again starts looking to its young designers, it's great to welcome a talent like this—who, by upending the old order of a big-time, show-off collection, has set her sights on making one specific, exceptional thing to slip into a wardrobe.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""l85qms""></div></div><p>A 1992 graduate of London's Central Saint Martins, Tao is the latest hopeful to emerge from behind the scenes at Comme des Garçons, where she now works with her own team of six designers.</p></div>"
134,spring,2006,s2006,temperley-london,"It would be too coarse to label Alice Temperley's leap from London to the New York schedule as a British <em>invasion</em>. The show was so delicate and Shakespearean you'd think it glided in on gossamer wings. Temperley has enjoyed rapid and abundant success since she introduced her line in 2000, and part of her reason for showing here, she said, was to acknowledge the overwhelming support she has received in the States. In a further show of gratitude, and business savvy, she's setting up shop within the month on Melrose Place in Los Angeles.</p><p>An overtly feminine loveliness is at the heart of Temperley's line, and the collection was full of the ornamented dresses and geometric knits for which she's become known. This season, cotton and silk dresses in colors like sweet pea, rose, aubergine, and blue featured appliqué and crochet inserts. Others had silver sequins in a glittery cobweb motif, and near the end, some dresses had mirror embroidery. There was a presiding bohemian theme, which the designer described as South American, but felt transcontinental in a Talitha Getty sort of way. Some draped and striped numbers, as well as a few jackets and tunics, popped up here and there, but this was a show about dresses, distinctly Temperley dresses, that ""celebrate being a woman.""</p></div>"
135,spring,2006,s2006,thakoon,"Thakoon Panichgul showed a collection today at Bumble and Bumble that was a rare gem. It was the designer's first runway outing, and he aimed for something ""modern and pretty in a twinkling kind of way."" A blue diamond print he developed, and worked into a wrap dress with a crystal jet button and a scarf-tied gown that closed the show, was all of those things and more. One gold satin coat featured pieced pockets in the shape of diamonds. Subtly executed, the jewel conceit was just one of the collection's stories.</p><p>After a filmy, light-as-air opening—a white strapless multilayer organza dress with scalloped hem—Panichgul sent out a series of pieces that were as weightless as handkerchiefs. Delicately tied knots were both structural and decorative: A cardigan was slashed and joined with ties, while a blue-striped cotton dress had a cutout oval back trimmed with them. A marine theme played out in the form of a sailor top, shorts, and a twill pinafore. Metallic silks and linens in gold and silver were glowing. Patent leather Manolo Blahnik mary janes shined. And ingeniously knotted ribbon necklaces with drops of jet had an undeniable magic. Maybe the designer's early years at fashion magazines taught him how to deliver a collection that wowed editors and buyers alike, because by the end of this ethereal show, he had the audience right where he wanted them, ""on cloud nine.""</p></div>"
136,spring,2006,s2006,tommy-hilfiger,"Tommy Hilfiger has been in business 20 long years, and he spared no extravagance last night to celebrate the milestone anniversary. As the lights dimmed on a star-studded front row that included Lou Reed, Paris Hilton, Jason Lewis, and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, who was scheduled to perform at the after-party, a movie of the designer's career highlights began rolling on the runway's enormous screen. Clips from his myriad rock concerts, fashion shows, countless celebrity photo ops, and reality TV hit <em>The Cut</em> whizzed past to a soundtrack by David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, and Hilfiger's old pal, Mr. Jagger.</p><p>Next came the models: exactly 100 of them, in tried-and-true preppy staples like seersucker suits, madras bermudas, rugby sweaters, and tan ""I spent the summer at the beach"" bare feet. In a tongue-in-cheek nod to his early days as a hip-hop clothier, boxers peeked over the waistbands of low-slung khakis and Nantucket-red pants, but everything else—tennis-racket-print shirtdress, anyone?—looked pulled from a Kennedy's closet. A huge beaded anchor splayed across a flaring skirt took the all-American and nautical themes at least a league too far, but Hilfiger made no apologies. As he came out for an enthusiastic bow, he sang along to the Rolling Stones hit ""Only Rock 'n' Roll"": ""I like it, I like it.""</p></div>"
137,spring,2006,s2006,topshop-unique,"A tent in Berkeley Square, Champagne flowing at multiple bars, a long balmy September evening: This was the hip but glamorous setup for Topshop's Unique collection, the most talked-about (and certainly best funded) show in London.</p><p>Topshop is a high street fashion phenomenon with 300 stores that attracts customers from celebrities to kids. For years, it has won itself popularity behind the scenes by philanthropically sponsoring young talents (who rely on its New Generation Award to be able to show at all). But all along, it has had its own in-house team of 14 young women designers, led by Nick Passmore (also a girl), working away at the basics. Now, the company has given that team its own chance to try out its abilities on the runway, with a smaller, higher-priced collection named Unique.</p><p>In a year when fashion teamwork (thanks to Chloé) is becoming better recognized, it's a justifiable move. Setting out to prove they aren't mere copyists, Passmore's gang went for a sportswear vibe, mixing slinky, boxing-influenced hooded jerseys with cotton judo jackets, keeping the look short and leggy. Dresses came in cotton with fluted gored skirts, belted and full, or as any number of asymmetrically slithery printed jerseys.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""iszgu6""></div></div><p>In spite of the grandeur of the setting, this was still the brand's debut performance in front of the world press, and, unsurprisingly, the team made several beginner's mistakes, including too many ideas and the failure to focus on a single look. Was it totally original? No—there were echoes here of Azzedine Alaïa, Hussein Chalayan, and Helmut Lang. But then again, no designer ever creates in a vacuum. The interesting angle, from a brand that speaks for (and dresses) youth in Britain, is that these young women are veering sharply away from anything frilly and ladylike. Like everyone in fashion right now, they're searching for the next new thing.</p></div>"
138,spring,2006,s2006,tuleh,"After Bryan Bradley's Sunday night show, one has to wonder if he'll be able to pack the front row next season with as many Park Avenue social types. The artier, more outré ones will come, but the clients who learned to love Tuleh for its elegant yet slightly offbeat cocktail dresses might drift away to a more reliable, if not reserved, house. Not that there weren't some fun party dresses. One strapless number spray-painted to resemble an artist's drop cloth was nothing if not a conversation starter, as was a floor-length chiffon gown split down the middle, with a vibrant tropical floral pattern on one side and its black-and-white counterpart on the other.</p><p>But a good portion of Bradley's looks won't make any party circuit, Upper East Side or otherwise. Take, for instance, pajama pants printed with lords and ladies in evening dress or an unwise (for anywhere but the boudoir) lace slip and skimpy robe. The designer isn't known for his restraint—and he certainly didn't show any with the speed at which he sent the models down the runway—but the show's loveliest look was its simplest. When Lisa Cant appeared in a strapless taupe gown, you could almost hear the audience sigh with relief.</p></div>"

Tokyo hipster designer Jun Takahashi has inspired such a following that he is something of a cult leader. But afterward, to put enquirers out of their misery of guessing, he admitted he'd made it all up.</p><p>""I was imagining progressive-rock German bands,"" he said, which explained the gothic headdresses and the belts and headpieces made of chains. It also cleared up the mystery of those unidentifiable washed-out photos of album covers and the smashed-up vinyl singles used like punk paillettes on a T-shirtdress.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""bupy2g""></div></div><p>Takahashi said that his extended riff on T-shirts was about ""taking something simple and limited, and seeing what you can do with it."" He sliced them up and pieced them into loose A-line dresses, turned them upside down to make dangly hip-wrapped skirts, then snipped off dozens of neck ribs and looped them onto tunics. In the light of day, none of it was too spookily out-there. But it was quite enough to keep his fashion believers kneeling at his feet.</p></div>"
140,spring,2006,s2006,united-bamboo,"The original motive behind United Bamboo, the 7-year-old line from Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham, was to interpret preppy American classics through the perspective of an arch observer. It's an obsession they've never truly abandoned, but now, there are broader influences thrown into the mix. For instance, Pham names Le Corbusier's design of the Indian city Chandigarh as their current fixation, and the architect's drawings were featured on patchwork tees. Pham's quick to add, however, that ""nothing is literal,"" which neatly sums up the appeal of the line.</p><p>With their typical sweetened cynicism, the show opened with a white tennis dress subverted with vibrant zippers—some functional, others not—which, along with buckles, were a recurring motif. That summer Kennebunk favorite, seersucker, was toughened up and turned into a motorcycle jacket, and its slightly brawny vibe was present throughout (particularly with the creepers—reworked with flat, pointy soles—which were big crowd-pleasers). A bibbed tuxedo-style shirtdress with a dropped hem was a nod to the Gatsby era and was equal parts masculine and feminine. These hard/soft, greaser/soc contrasts were most successful in the first half of the show. Later, the African and ribbon-latticed dresses seemed overly decorative and diverted from Aoki and Pham's real strength: seditious versions of country club classics.</p></div>"
141,spring,2006,s2006,valentino,"Valentino's new rallying cry? ""To stand apart from all the fake couture that has dominated the runways for the past few seasons."" If that sounds kind of cocky, well, fair enough: This is a designer with four decades of experience under his belt, who's due to accept a Superstar award from the Fashion Group International this month in New York. More importantly, he's considering retirement, and the house has begun looking for a successor. His legacy is, understandably, on his mind.</p><p>Whatever his motivation, Valentino rose to the challenge, upping his already haute luxe factor and sending out a spring collection that was fresher and lighter than it's looked in a long time. On a V-shape runway, he opened with the kind of tapered and cropped-above-the-ankle black pants that were in fashion when he launched his house. These were paired with crisp white shirts and short black jackets or skinny white blazers, along with matte red lips and ballerina flats. The classic color combination carried over into evening, where the winner among many memorable efforts was a dress of black organza ruffles tiered to the floor with clouds of white organza for sleeves.</p><p>Valentino gave equal play to gorgeous color, which appeared in rose prints, and rich floral embroideries that captured the season's feel for Asian motifs. The single trademark red dress that closed the show came with one shoulder strap, in keeping with another recurring idea on the spring runways. His program notes may have alluded to perceived threats from the competition, but when it comes to jet-set elegance, Valentino has no rivals.</p></div>"
142,spring,2006,s2006,vera-wang,"Vera Wang is having a moment. She won the CFDA award in June. Her resort collection, which combined the American sensibility of Claire McCardell with the vibrant palette of Matisse, earned raves from buyers and editors alike. And she continued that momentum by introducing a collection in a similar vein for spring. This time, she injected a new, raw edge into the formula, courtesy of the HBO frontier drama <em>Deadwood.</em> ""The idea was to do primitive,"" said Wang backstage. ""Matisse's models dressed not unlike the female characters on that show.""</p><p>Of course, Wang's <em>salopettes,</em> farmers shirts, and ""nightgowns"" looked a little too rich for life on the Great Plains. That's thanks, in part, to the iridescent chiffons, brocades, taffetas, and duchesse satins she used for evening and, more surprisingly, for day. She cut and draped those fabrics like a modern Charles James (a designer known for lush, elegantly structured gowns, to whom some audience members compared her), creating tops, skirts, and dresses that puffed around the body without ever feeling bulky. Among the many standouts were an electric-blue smock blouse and navy dirndl skirt, a black off-the-shoulder number, which was shown with flats (as were most of her longer silhouettes), and a red silk apron dress with an elasticized hem. Jackets also had volume, especially those that were fuller on top and gathered near the bottom—as if they were pulled on upside down. Gritty, raffia sashes and the occasional sturdy leather belt gave the collection a touch of downtown, if not of South Dakota, but it's bound to be a hit everywhere.</p></div>"
143,spring,2006,s2006,veronique-branquinho,"One of the last looks in Veronique Branquinho's spring show exemplified the kind of effortless, understated chic for which the label has always stood—a dark charcoal dress that fell almost trapeze-like from the bust to the knees, with deep pleats down one side of the body. Trenchcoats and sheaths with built-in capes looked similarly cool, especially when paired with bicep-grazing black leather gloves: It was easy to imagine the hipper members of the audience thinking to themselves, ""Good idea.""</p><p>There weren't a lot of those to go around, though. Sweatshirt-gray jerseys and fine-gauge sweaters worn with pencil skirts were pretty enough, but hardly earthshaking, and there were too many jumpsuits with elasticized waists. The smartly tailored tuxedo pants and smoking jackets that closed the show were winners, but not so the mint-color strapless leotards and leggings Branquinho showed with the majority of the collection. They looked like what they were: styling gimmicks whipped up to distract from a dearth of strong concepts.</p></div>"
144,spring,2006,s2006,veronique-leroy,"Véronique Leroy's timing couldn't be better. She's dress obsessed, the dress is the item of the season, and a seemingly unlimited number of PYT's are eager to wear… dresses. For spring, the designer softened fall's strict governess styles in favor of a more rustic aesthetic inspired by ceremonial garb like wedding and communion gowns. Her delicate tone-on-tone embroidered pieces were sweet yet not cloying (with the exception of her bloomer ensembles). Upending the popular tulip shape, Leroy opted for full, romantic sleeves. Such volume worked best atop one of the designer's covetable dresses or when balanced with short skirts rather than hot pants. Like Leroy's voodoo-inspired jewelry, the slim-tailored pantsuits and tunic ensembles that opened the show offset the prettiness of the rest of the collection.</p></div>"
145,spring,2006,s2006,verrier,"Twenty-four-year-old Ashleigh Verrier said her New York fashion week debut was inspired by the early days of American sportswear, but there was nothing off-the-rack or immature about the line she showed Thursday afternoon. Her polished 12-look presentation ran the gamut from a silk racer-back tank and baggy tweed shorts to a navy cocktail dress trimmed in silver sequins, and each piece was finished with great care. The neckline of a simple jersey tee was piped in a contrasting color. Top-stitching added interest to a pencil skirt and trench cut from raw burlap. And a black lace overlay will make an otherwise straightforward navy-and-white shirt stand out and be noticed among the multitudes at Saks Fifth Avenue. The department store bought her Parsons thesis collection last year and has since been a loyal customer. An internship at Proenza Schouler's studio left obvious marks on this young designer; one collarless coat owed a debt to the duo. Otherwise, the mix-and-match, masculine-feminine sensibility Verrier is cultivating appears to be hers, and hers alone.</p></div>"
146,spring,2006,s2006,versace,"Donatella Versace has recently spent some time in Palm Springs. ""It was a reflective moment,"" she said. ""The colors and the landscape inspired me a lot."" Judging by the collection, the holiday did her good, not just in her choice of sandy, ombréd shades and cactus prints, but in her resolve to smooth out lines and turn down the bling several notches. Donatella's girls, groomed to perfection and purposefully powering forward in groups, made by far the slickest vision of glamour to be had in Milan.</p><p>She dealt with day by sending out lean pants cropped at the ankle, neat leather biker jackets, shorts, and a perfectly proportioned narrow ostrich coat with bracelet-length sleeves. Her notion of a day dress has shifted from leg-flashing and breast-gripping to—for her—a relatively eased-up cut that still expertly outlines curves but ends 3 inches below the knee. A couple of the best were in plain navy, too complexly pieced to be called understated, but exuding a new, classy kind of sexiness.</p><p>At night—especially with her reworkings of the classic Versace beaded gowns—she really shone, applying a delicacy of touch she's never attained before. Dispensing with her former reliance on corseting and cantilevering, she let shapes flow along a more natural bodyline. A black-to-navy degrade gown, subtly shaded like the midnight sky, was the highpoint of a strong show.</p></div>"
147,spring,2006,s2006,viktor-rolf,"When the catwalk's on the ceiling, and the show runs in reverse—starting with the designers taking their bow and the standard encore parade of models in bridal and eveningwear clapping their way along the runway—what show could it be other than Viktor &amp; Rolf? It seemed a jolly jape in the beginning, what with all the fast-forward pace of it and Diana Ross singing ""upside-down you're turning me"" on the soundtrack. But just as the requisite notes on white gazar flounces, cream and gold charmeuse, and skinny tux looks were scribbled, and the crowd was floating along with the happy feeling they'd be out of there in a flash, the music started slurring and jerking like a sick headache.</p><p>After the false start, a reincarnation of one of Viktor &amp; Rolf's first huge, white ruffled couture art pieces appeared at the end of the runway, followed by upside-down satin gowns, upended tuxedos (jacket as trousers; pants as a bolero), twisted trenches, and sideway ensembles that looked like the models got their heads stuck in the wrong hole during a bout of too hasty dressing.</p><p>Of course, this transpired as a commentary on the state of fashion from our Dutch surrealist friends, who have put their heads together to focus on the business of brand building.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""sby5t""></div></div><p>""Fashion is running out of time,"" said Rolf Snoeren. ""We are going too fast. Originality and patience is the only way to go forward."" Thus, they also slipped in notes on how their signatures translate when they're upside-up, like the white camisole dress, the pretty things in champagne, ivory, and coffee, the white sleeveless summer pantsuit, or the ruffled blouse. And when they're set straight, (here's the real joke) they look just like supernormal clothes.</p></div>"
148,spring,2006,s2006,vpl,"Jessica Simpson in her Daisy Duke attire would have fit right in at Victoria Bartlett's <em>Hands on a Hard Body</em> show. Held at the Audi showroom on Park Avenue, the set consisted of a rotating platform, four lingerie-clad models drinking beer (from the can) with male escorts, and a shiny red sports car. It was a vignette straight out of a gimmicky car show, and somehow, it worked. Bartlett, whose line has evolved from lingerie to casual/active sportswear, showed a mature collection with inspired details.</p><p>Baggy skorts made of sports mesh in huge hip-hop proportions were paired with ""slip bras."" Miniskirts were contoured and color-blocked or trimmed with diaphanous metallic silk. Mesh gussets on tanks and tees ""represent perspiration,"" said the designer, who was playing with the idea of fitness and ""the quest for body perfection."" A ""nude mega tie hoody"" was a silky coat for a girl on the go from the gym to… who knows where. As usual, the accessories were a hit. Bartlett made Airtex sandals and sock boots for Report. Brian Crumley provided terrycloth accessories, including unusual neckpieces that sat like triangles at the nape and were connected by a chain in front. Alyssa Norton's woven chain-and-fabric sweatbands, and Josh Hickey's ostrich egg necklaces finished the show, and had an unusual sex appeal.</p></div>"
149,spring,2006,s2006,who-is-on-next,"Who Is on Next? is the debut project of Italian <em>Vogue</em> and its editor in chief, Franca Sozzani, working together with Rome's haute couture federation, Milan's fashion council, and Italy's central buying body to discover and nurture fledgling talent in their industry—paralleling New York's Fashion Fund and London's Fashion Fringe initiatives. From 300 original applicants, the international judging committee selected three winners—two fashion houses and one footwear label—who were able to showcase their work before an impressive roster of press and buyers.</p><p>Albino D'Amato, who studied at Paris' Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture and went on to work as an assistant at houses in Paris and Milan, brought his sophisticated background to a collection that focused on experiments with volume and proportion. Citing Romy Schneider's romantic fifties and sixties movies, and Viennese and Bauhaus art movements, D'Amato caught a number of current runway trends, among them drop-waist twenties gymslip dresses, sunray pleats (here in black tulle shadowing navy chiffon), and the deconstructed trench. He added his signature in details including jewel-like miniature gold roses scattered as embroidery trim.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>A runway presentation may not have been the ideal showcase for Carlo Alberto Pregnolato's understatedly elegant shoes—even if they were shown here with the pretty, fragile goddess dresses of New York-based Jean Yu. Pregnolato's subtle high-heel sandals came in mouthwatering combinations of colors (including Yves Klein blue, hibiscus pink, and Parma violet) and materials (matte suede with shining reptile, textiles designed by Falconetto or Gio Ponti). And if they trod ground that's been well worn by Manolo Blahnik, perhaps that's down to DNA; Pregnolato's aunt worked with the celebrated Vigevano-based maker that produces the grand old master's footwear, too.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""b1c10n""></div></div><p>Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi have been designing anonymously for a big-name Italian manufacturing house for long enough to know exactly how beautiful clothes are put together. And now, with their label, cryptically called 6267 (it's Rimondi's clothing ID number from his childhood summer camp), launched in 2004, they have been able to wed their technical skills with design innovation. With this sophisticated collection, the design duo combined detail from Spanish matador costumes with a sleek, narrow-skirted line that evoked the midcentury couture exaggerations of designers like Jacques Fath and Christian Dior—all executed with a refreshingly twenty-first-century lightness of touch. Some of their silhouettes and deft draperies owe a debt to Roland Mouret. But the meticulous attention to detail (the elaborate frogging of a bullfighter's suit of lights simulated in ivory linen to match a jacket, for instance), couture fabrications, and seductive palette (cocoa, lilac, old rose, copper, ink) set them apart as exemplars of accomplished modern elegance.</p></div>"
150,spring,2006,s2006,wunderkind,"Wolfgang Joop is in some ways a prisoner of his name. The inspired Wunderkind collection Joop showed today in the tents deserved a fresh look, with an eye unbiased by the designer's first heyday, in the eighties and nineties. It was truly an exercise in sophisticated, highly accomplished design. Though Joop is no longer emerging, his collection is, with its progression in crescendo.</p><p>That is not to say that it was perfect. It suffered from a surfeit of ideas and, in passionate, operatic moments of layered flou, edged into Stevie Nicks territory. The standout moments, like a white canvas pantsuit worn by Tiiu Kuik, compensated for the weaker links.</p><p>Post-show, the designer talked about his lasting attachment to the painters Jean-Antoine Watteau and Gustav Klimt and their ""hunger for upper-class romance."" The idea of appetite took interesting form in the collection, which picked up on the tablecloth theme making its way through New York fashion week. The finale dress of lace silk was cut like a circular table cover, Joop explained, though it's not obvious at first glance. And dimensional cuffs referenced eighteenth-century napkin-stuffed sleeves.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tulbu""></div></div><p>Table linens aside, menswear was also a strong theme worked into the show via striped shirtings, tie silks, baggy proportions, and fantastic pleat-front shirtdresses. It was the perfect antidote to romance, which was present everywhere, and a nice counterpoint to lace-front and embroidered Romanian-style blouses, as was an English-rose print worked into long dresses with intricate braiding insets. Wunderkind (with the awkward growing pains behind him), indeed.</p></div>"
151,spring,2006,s2006,y-kei,"Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang are true romantics. The collections the Korea-based husband-and-wife design team have shown in New York for the past six seasons have been valentines, ones that have often been overly sweet. But their spring show found them hitting their stride. From the first look to the last, the duo touched on many of the major themes of the week: white eyelets, saucy sailor looks, a touch of menswear. The styling emphasized the easier mood: The models wore their hair long and loose, and many of the looks were topped with fresh-from-the-beach strands of beads. The duo must have a crush on the trench, because they offered about five wonderful versions of it, in light blue, a crinkled sheer gray, and in a casually belted sleeveless dress version. Handwork showed in the form of ruched bodices and patchworked pieces, and one long, sand-colored linen dress worn by Anja Rubik was delicately embroidered. Yoon and Kang went a bit astray with their sunny polka dots, but all in all, it was easy to take a shine to this collection.</p></div>"
152,spring,2006,s2006,y-3,"New York City might have lost its bid for the Olympics, but that didn't stop Y-3, the fashion/active-sportswear fusion created by Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas, from decamping from Paris to show here. For their first show stateside, they went for the money shot, presenting the collection in an elaborate production at 55 Wall Street. Black-and-orange Y-3 flags floated above the building's columned facade. Inside, white carpets led to a three-lane, Adidas-striped runway. After keeping the audience waiting for an hour, a giant James Bond-style vault at the end of the runway was opened by two masked men, releasing teams of models from the safe behind it.</p><p>Black and white separates opened the show, but there wasn't a cult favorite Y-3 sneaker in sight. The models wore clunky wedges with striped heels instead. Logo stripes, which were the main conceit of the show, turned up in orange-on-denim separates and in crystals on tuxedo-style pants worn by Caroline Winberg. More crystals (a favorite this season) followed, on glittering striped halters that earned the descriptive ""bling,"" and embellished soccer balls were entirely impractical but eye-catching.</p><p>Y-3 has a graphic story each season. This time, it was currency, which may explain the Wall Street location and the <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em> vibe. A V-neck money-print dress fitted under the bust had a full, flowy skirt. Accessories, including whistles, beaded chains, rolling luggage, and sequined scarves were featured prominently.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4i7p07""></div></div><p>The sportiest looks had the strongest impact, like a white bathing suit with black stripes at the seams, logo leggings, and a long striped skirt on Claudia Marikula. Y-3 is clearly geared up and ready to play. On your mark, get set, go.</p></div>"
153,spring,2006,s2006,yohji-yamamoto,"""I wanted to play with the history of fashion,"" said Yohji Yamamoto backstage after his spring show. ""With the history of the earth, from dinosaurs to humans."" If anyone's up to the task of condensing all of recorded history into a minutes-long show, it's this uniquely inventive designer.</p><p>The collection was divided into several different sections marked by interludes of musical extremes, from piano solos to Iggy Pop. But one unifying theme was that nearly all of the looks featured something oversize, exaggerated, or otherwise blown out of proportion. Take, for example, the train of a black coat, complete with jagged, cut-out fabric ridges and a pair of horns, borrowing the identifying markings of a triceratops tail. Whimsical? Yes. A showpiece? Definitely. However, this artful outing wasn't without its wearable pieces.</p><p>Yamamoto started by tweaking the traditional elements of the tuxedo, enlarging the cuffs and collars, and pairing tails with overalls or jeans. A camouflage material offset more-feminine silhouettes, like a wrap dress with ear-grazing ruffled shoulders and a floor-length bustled skirt. Color came in the way of a royal-blue tailored jacket with blousy pockets of navy velvet and a below-the-knee skirt to match, or a ribbon-tied brown apron worn on one side of the body atop an all-black ensemble, but it didn't stop with the clothes. Hair stylist Eugene Souleiman arranged rectangular swags in shades from platinum to raven along the models' eyebrows.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""rdgvl""></div></div><p>Evening looks were more fantastical. It isn't entirely clear what coiled lengths of rope and industrial tubing have to do with those backstage talking points, but audience members didn't mind. When Lily Cole walked down the aisle in a wedding gown with a ball skirt bustling in every direction, atop a rope ring and a corsage of braided tubes, they responded with a cheer.</p></div>"
154,spring,2006,s2006,zac-posen,"There's enough of Zac Posen to go around. He's teamed up with Seven for All Mankind to create a deluxe denim line and launched a veritable wild kingdom of an accessories collection, heavy on the python, stingray, and lizard. Apparently, his primary collection hasn't suffered from the diversions, because Thursday, he put on the most mature show of his still-short career. ""Picture a woman on a trip to Sardinia with her much older boyfriend,"" he said backstage. ""It starts with a walk on the beach and ends at bedtime, in the clouds."" Sounds dreamy, and it was, from Carmen's bubble-sleeve jacket, blouse, and cuffed shorts to Shalom's jade-green and gold goddess dress.</p><p>It's true that there weren't a lot of looks that will work for the office, but that's not what the Park Avenue set and Young Hollywood want from Posen. They're not likely to choose his tie silk dresses, either; the silhouettes were young and fresh, especially Tiiu's halter style, but the pattern was much too busy. Instead, sexy knits drew the biggest response. A crochet number got an especially big cheer from Diddy (his business partner) and his posse. Summery whites, some in the season's must-have eyelet, were hits. And big-time ball gowns, of the ""I'm a designer to be reckoned with"" variety, have grandeur and enough Posen-style drama for aspiring Scarlett O'Haras.</p></div>"
155,spring,2006,s2006,zero-maria-cornejo,"One doesn't expect histrionics from a line called Zero, and that's not designer Maria Cornejo's style. Instead, she quietly delivers thoughtful, somewhat provocative designs season after season, with signatures like curvy patterns, lots of draping, and cocoon shapes. All of which made appearances at her spring show, freshly transformed and presented in a palette of ivory, brown, copper, blue, and lemon inspired by Czech Art Nouveau printmaker Alphonse Mucha.</p><p>What Cornejo described as her ""essential dresses"" were bubble hemmed, with Empire waistlines or ruched details. One such piece had embroidery that resembled bark, another had winglike stitching falling softly from the side seams. A striking Venus gown of blue lamé linen had a dramatic cowl neckline. Casual winners included ensembles built around slim pants and Jacquard shorts, some paired with jersey tees and others with loosely constructed tops cinched with natural leather belts, and customized Zero for Keds skimmers. Once again, Cornejo achieved the ""airy, flowing, sensual"" effect she was after, and the tally in the win column was much more than zero.</p></div>"
1,fall,2006,f2006,a-f-vandevorst,"A.F. Vandevorst's Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst said they had ""a seduction"" in mind while designing their fall line—that of the artist Joseph Beuys by an imaginary paramour. The concept played to what is usually one of the duo's strengths: lingerie. At one point, four models performed a sort of striptease, untying softly tailored white shirts to reveal retro underpinnings, and for good measure, the designers featured a disembodied voice chanting ""silence is sexy"" on the soundtrack. The overall effect though was curiously unerotic—a state of affairs that wasn't helped by the fact that the show was staged in Paris' cavernous and altogether unromantic Palais Omnisport.</p><p>The collection worked better when the Belgian duo abandoned the carnal pursuits for the kind of smart sportswear that would fly at the office or on a first date—think stiff trenches, slouchy cardigans, and fur gilets. The latter came in many variations and lengths; the chicest were cinched at the waist, just grazing the hips. A pair of dresses, one in a cream kimono style and another in pleated black jersey, was covered up, but didn't lack for come-hither appeal. And speaking of sexy, the few over-the-knee leather boots A.F. Vandevorst showed had the collection's menagerie of clunky rabbit-fur booties looking like children's winterwear in comparison.</p></div>"
2,fall,2006,f2006,adam-lippes,"Buddakan, soon to be the latest addition to the 24-hour open-air club/mall known as Manhattan's Meatpacking District, was the location of the Adam + Eve presentation. This was the first public outing of the company's ready-to-wear line, which was introduced to retailers last spring. Adam Lippes, a former Oscar de la Renta creative director, initially launched the company in 2004 as an underwear and T-shirt line, and it seems to be growing rapidly—having taken just two years to expand into sportswear.</p><p>Lippes set out to create ""luxury basics,"" rather than follow trends, and the presentation featured great, collegiate-feeling pieces for both men and women. A fur vest would be great for tailgating, and jackets had three-quarter sleeves—all the better to layer over longer sweaters, many of them striped and V-necked. Dresses, like a pintucked tank number with feather embroidery at the hem, were worn with comfy alpaca cardigans, projecting an attitude of ease.</p></div>"
3,fall,2006,f2006,akris,"Albert Kriemler's Akris collections speak in hushed tones. That's what makes his clothes so popular with ladies of decorous taste yet lavish means, but it doesn't always make for good runway. To compare him to the showman Karl Lagerfeld—whose Chanel productions directly precede those of Akris—isn't fair, of course, but Kriemler doesn¿t help his cause with some of his staging choices. Why not select music that's a little more upbeat? And while we're on the subject of change, perhaps he should think about swapping the catacombs of the Carrousel du Louvre for a new venue—someplace spare and fuss-free like his clothes.</p><p>Like many other designers this season, Kriemler found inspiration in the sculpted silhouettes of Cristobal Balenciaga. Coats in black mattelassé and ultra-luxe heather-gray vicuña had a cocoon-like shape. Whether or not Akris customers will embrace this backward-looking, forward-moving new direction remains to be seen. But Kriemler played it safer with such items as slouchy cashmere knits and pants cut two ways: slim and tapered or fuller with flap pockets. For evening, the designer rather puzzlingly eliminated structure, draping silk satin or crepe in front and back and occasionally leaving the sides of the torso uncovered. Unlike other elements of the collection, these won't make the leap to retail without some serious rethinking back at the studio.</p></div>"
4,fall,2006,f2006,alberta-ferretti,"She's come a long way from girly chiffon and folksy boho. From the very first look, a chain-belted sixties fur coat with rounded shoulders, it was apparent Alberta Ferretti would be making interesting strides into a new kind of sophistication. Grown-up wasn't quite the word for it, because these were still clothes for a young woman; it's just that she had synthesized ideas about structure and styling in a way that looked valid for the season, but that was also highly personal.</p><p>She can do a little pleated shift, of course; that came second in the show. There was a distinct difference in mood this time, though, apparent in the way she used the reference point of the mod sixties to make a statement of her own. Anyone can do an easy retro show, but Ferretti's individual touch ensured that these clothes—the flat, calf-high boots, the stiff, rounded capes and pod-shape skirts—weren't vintage rehash. She made a hybrid out of fall's heavier black, navy, brown, and gray wools and jerseys and her usual light, romantic pintucks and ruffles, often pulling looks together with the great unifying device of a wide metal-link belt, woven onto suede.</p><p>There were many (perhaps too many) different kinds of dresses: short shifts, Empire-line cocktail dresses, almost Edwardian-waist ones. The best were her versions of the long, slim gowns in daywear fabric that have become the Milan trend. She personalized a navy one with a bib of pintucked chiffon shirting, a good example of avoiding the too obvious. As for red carpet, Ferretti sent Carmen Kass out in a stiff gold double-knit Lurex gown—it had a whiff of the sixties, but was very new, too. As we said, a long way from the predictable girly chiffon. Plaudits to her.</p></div>"
5,fall,2006,f2006,alessandro-dell-acqua,"It's his tenth anniversary in fashion, which was all the excuse Alessandro Dell'Acqua needed to reflect on his greatest hits. ""I love dresses, I love knitwear, I love nude and black,"" he said backstage, and all those elements were present in his new collection. Though there were accents of green, purple, and leopard print, the definitive Dell'Acqua outfit for fall is a bustier dress in black nylon, hand-hemmed in a hefty weight of black beading, with a tiny little black cardigan tugged over the top.</p><p>The designer momentarily broke with the past by skipping the chiffon he's often used to achieve his signature veiling effects, instead using a black techno-tulle that is more commonly employed as an extreme-sports fabric. It was laid to suggestive effect over flesh-tone knitwear or a nude dress made of lining fabric. Though the result hinted at something vaguely fetishistic, Dell'Acqua insisted he had the earthiness of legendary Italian actress Anna Magnani in mind. The dark smudged eyes and bed hair of the models certainly suggested her influence. So did the casual sensuality of an outfit that featured a shirt open over a bra, worn with a nude pencil skirt and a big woolen stole. The bra, however, was in gleaming lacquered wool, a reminder of the technical fabric treatments that frequently characterize Dell'Acqua's work. These were highlighted to great effect on a coat whose intricate pattern was formed from laser-cut fur on a techno-fabric background. The lining of lingerie lace, meanwhile, meant all the designer's fascinations were brought together in one item.</p></div>"
6,fall,2006,f2006,alexander-mcqueen,"Only Alexander McQueen could provide the astonishing feat of techno-magic that ended his show. Inside an empty glass pyramid, a mysterious puff of white smoke appeared from nowhere and spun in midair, slowly resolving itself into the moving, twisting shape of a woman enveloped in the billowing folds of a white dress. It was Kate Moss, her blonde hair and pale arms trailing in a dream-like apparition of fragility and beauty that danced for a few seconds, then shrank and dematerialized into the ether.</p><p>This vision was in fact a state-of-the-art hologram—a piece by the video maker Baillie Walsh, art-directed by McQueen. The gown, a pale cascade of multiple organza ruffles, wasn't just an optical effect, though. It subsequently reappeared in the collection's victory line up, which wound its way around the glass box as the audience was still reverberating with wonder at witnessing this incredible event.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>The quality of the performance—and the extraordinary workmanship in the clothes that preceded it—was a timely reconfirmation of McQueen's unique powers as a showman-designer, and a far cry from the more straightforward presentations he¿s given the last few seasons. For this collection, he delved into his past, revisiting his Scottish family roots and refining the contents of the rampaging tartan ""Highland Rape"" show with which he began his career in London in the early nineties. Shorn of its original rawness and anger, the result was a poetic and technically accomplished tale that involved romantic images of Scottish fantasy heroines wandering glens and castle halls in vaguely Victorian tartan crinolines, bird-wing or antler-and-lace headdresses, feathered gowns, and pieces made from brocades that might have been dragged down from ancient wall-hangings.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""89oq8s""></div></div><p>Some of McQueen's references—like the ones that influenced his sinuous black velvet dresses—appeared to be culled from pre-Raphaelite paintings of Lady Macbeth; others, like a fierce, bell-skirted warrior-woman plaid dress with lace armlets, seemed to owe more to punk. On the down-to-earth side, there was plenty of McQueen's sharp and salable tailoring on show, and some great coats, like a herringbone fur chesterfield. At the end, though, the ecstatic applause was primarily in honor of the experience—a memory that will go down as one of fashion's all-time highs.</p></div>"
7,fall,2006,f2006,alexandre-herchcovitch,"While some of his peers have been touting an eighties revival, Alexandre Herchcovitch took a different turn, presenting a serene show that was inspired by the Italian Renaissance. He created a courtly atmosphere by placing a line of tasseled flags down the center of the runway, some flying his initials, others with skull and crossbones. ""I wanted to mix something noble with something punk,"" he explained. The show opened with an emphasis on the latter, featuring all-black looks, the best of which were strong-shouldered military-style coats, adorned with rows of buttons. Color was first introduced in the form of a simple purple chiffon dress with subtly quilted sleeves. Cinched with a belt with a skull buckle, it was one of the show's strongest looks. Punk Ophelias also had their pick of flowy patchwork floral gowns, as well as Capulet-sleeve jackets to layer over them. Less attractive were a series of complicated dresses with floral prints strangely veiled under chiffon. If not a royal flush, this collection, taken in pieces, looked confident and romantic, and showed Herchcovitch back on track after spring's psychedelic trip.</p></div>"
8,fall,2006,f2006,alice-roi,"Cue the Violent Femmes, PiL, and the Misfits. Alice Roi is turning 30—that's practically middle-aged in this business of 14-year-old models and <em>Project Runway</em> enfants terribles. And so she revisited the New York City of her youth with black lipstick, broken-down mary janes, and prep-school uniforms twisted to get past the bouncers on St. Marks. Yes, there were pinafore dresses and boiled-wool vests and wrap skirts, but they were offset with knit sweaters and leggings that looked like they'd been through the washing machine a few times. Party frocks, meanwhile, came punked up with patent leather accents. But if they were worn underneath one of her smart houndstooth coats, Mom and Dad would never be the wiser.</p></div>"
9,fall,2006,f2006,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"Vivienne Westwood was made a Dame of the British Empire last month by Queen Elizabeth II, and she's one of just a handful of designers due to be fêted at the upcoming <em>AngloMania</em> exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute, but she hasn't given up on her trademark brand of rebellious dishabille. Tartans, bustiers, toga wrapping, and Edwardian pannier skirts—all essential elements of the Westwood vocabulary—came fast and furious down her wooden-plank catwalk on models with glossy red lips and tousled upswept hair. The layered-up looks had a disheveled, madcap appeal in which Westwood, who took to the runway with her tiny rhinestone horns firmly in place, clearly revels.</p><p>If at first glance it's harder for her audience to enjoy, or understand, they need only take it apart to discover some real, wearable pieces. Sure to please her loyal acolytes were the slouchy suede booties, the bustled skirts with unfinished hems, and the little cardigans (of course, she had the models wearing them backward, buttons askew). A navy silk corseted top, meanwhile, might win Westwood some new fans. Those plaid jackets and coats with the fin shoulders, however, will be a harder sell. And it's doubtful that you'll be seeing any of the hologram ball gowns or harem suits at the Costume Institute ball come May.</p></div>"
10,fall,2006,f2006,andrew-gn,"Andrew Gn designs for a rarefied customer, the kind who prefers her jet crystals to be of a 1950's or '60's vintage, and is willing to pay for the privilege. In addition to those chandelier-size baubles, which decorated the necklines of four-ply cashmere sweaters, the Singapore-born designer sourced antique laces that appeared as trim on skirtsuits and as insets on silk camisoles. ""There was no holding back,"" Gn acknowledged backstage. Observe, for instance, a baby-pink cashmere coat with swirls of black silk cord at the hem and a chin-grazing collar of white fox. In a season when the buzzwords include monasticism, rigor, and restraint, some of his more heavily embellished pieces came off as doubly extravagant.</p><p>But if the jet teardrops shimmying on a silk tulle evening coat ran counter to the current trend, you couldn't quibble with Gn's construction. There was a couture-like finish to the slightly puffed sleeves and peplum hem of a checked jacket, and a youthful fit to a tweed blazer with three-quarter-length sleeves. For evening, he revisited the tiered dresses he did for spring, but in fall's more subtle color palette: white, blush, a quiet printed check. And perhaps mindful that his gowns' high prices can prove a stumbling block to aspiring clients of the young or not-so-young variety, Gn introduced another new twist this season: a costume-jewelry collection.</p></div>"
11,fall,2006,f2006,ann-demeulemeester,"In a season when so many designers have begun quoting ideas about warrior women, and getting excited about gothic northern layerings, kudos are due to Ann Demeulemeester. She, after all, invented—or rather inhabits—this style. For her, sending out a strong urban female with an elegant-barbaric wardrobe is no passing whim, but a way of life, thoroughly believed in for 20 years.</p><p>For fall there were no surprises: It looked just as it ever has, with just a few twists to the interpretation. Demeulemeester did black layers, of course, but there were subtleties. She had narrow military cutaway coats and long, asymmetric velvet dresses that trailed sinuously; these ideas, nothing new for her, were right on track with the general direction of fashion at the moment. She added wide pants and metallic leathers that also happen to jibe with current trends. When Demeulemeester put her mind to redefining the long skirt—always a part of her oeuvre, but now a subject of the minute—she came up with a tiny bolero jacket over a narrow, sari-like tube, draped from one shoulder. Excellent—but, then again, hardly a deviation from her continuous line of thought. And that's the cool thing about Demeulemeester: Though she intuits the general shape of fashion in her collection, nothing will ever knock her off the integrity of her course.</p></div>"
12,fall,2006,f2006,anna-sui,"Anna Sui is fashion's consummate magpie, borrowing bits from here, pieces from there, but putting them all together as only she can. For fall, she sampled mostly from the sixties. There was a trace of <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> in a navy wool cardigan with brass closures, the patterned shirtdresses with white collars and cuffs brought to mind Catherine Deneuve in <em>Belle de Jour</em>, and the shifts cut from crocheted tablecloth suggested the pixie Mia Farrow. We've seen all this before from Sui, maybe more than once. But what surprised this time around was how pared-down and grown-up the collection felt. She's been known to scatter a pile of trompe l'oeil chains on a gauze dress. But when it's the real thing? Just one will do nicely, thank you.</p><p>Sui's girls are usually accessorized to the hilt, and there were a few fab wheelies in a carpetbagger velvet print, but some models hit the runway sans belt, bag, or hat. The lack of add-ons allowed for closer inspection of the clothes themselves, and this season there were some knockouts. An iridescent midnight-blue wrap dress puffed out below the waist, right on trend. Equally of the moment were a striped wool jacket and knickers worn with a ruffle-front ivory blouse. Meanwhile, Sui's metallic Jacquard dress will make you wish for the days, not so long ago, when boho was the biggest thing.</p></div>"
13,fall,2006,f2006,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi didn't get the memo about rigor and restraint. For fall—his second season in Paris—he sent out a collection of peaked-shoulder, nipped-waist jackets, pencil skirts, and clingy sheaths that was blatantly about sex. Many of the pieces came with their inner workings exposed: A bustier peeked out above the bodice of an hourglass flannel dress, and corsetry details were inset on the back of a fitted coat. And those were just the beginning of the often overwrought decorations. A cloud of black rosettes—like a corsage on steroids—clung to one arm of a dress, an evening gown's worth of crystals lined the edge of a cobalt cardigan in a heavy-gauge cashmere; that same daytime yarn—this time in acid yellow—was knit into a strapless minidress.</p><p>Of course, it's not Berardi's fault that the fashion pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, and there's certainly still an audience for his brand of overt sexiness. However, many of the items he showed today—the sheer hose studded along the back seams, not to mention the role-playing props such as secretary glasses and nurse caps—would be better left in the bedroom.</p></div>"
14,fall,2006,f2006,aquascutum,"It's rare to see polish, modernity, and quality together in a single collection on a London runway—and all the more exciting when it's coming out of a great British background. After three seasons, a convincing revolution really is under way in the back room at Aquascutum, where Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler are recutting the heritage of the coat-and-tailoring brand into great-looking twenty-first-century shape.</p><p>The best symbol of change is their chrome-yellow bouclé coat, slightly bubble-shaped, with bracelet-length sleeves: right proportion, right length, and right on the money in its reference to Cristobal Balenciaga. Better still, it's a piece Herz and Fidler developed from the company's archive, which contains racks of beautiful coats aimed at well-dressed ladies who appreciated Balenciaga's style in the fifties. The duo's knack: knowing how to turn an authentic reference into something young and of today.</p><p>In fact, the outstanding items in this collection were all coats: collarless ecru ottoman shapes with slightly stiff volumes; a brown high-collared cossack with a raised waist; a pale washed-silk trench. One black coat came with a belt decorated with silver flower-and-leaf embroideries commissioned from the specialists who work on British military regalia. There was plenty more going on here, too, in the way of short Empire-line dresses and complicated deconstructions of trenches and pantsuits. Herz and Fidler's creative enthusiasm can't be faulted, but they do their best work when they keep things simple. Several editors in the audience found their gaze slipping enviously toward the immaculately undeconstructed men's jackets. That could be a good way for women to go next season—but in the meanwhile it's good to see these young designers finding a voice.</p></div>"
15,fall,2006,f2006,araks,"The fact that Araks Yeramyan's lingerie has a cult following that includes Sarah Jessica Parker and Sofia Coppola (who featured it on Scarlett Johansson in <em>Lost in Translation</em>) is reason enough to stir interest in her first efforts at ready-to-wear. A Parsons grad who has worked at J.Crew and Marc Jacobs, Yeramyan launched her Araks lingerie line in 2000, adding swimwear in 2004, and last year produced a capsule collection that was picked up by Barneys New York. Fall marked her ready-to-wear debut.</p><p>Vaguely inspired by the twenties, the collection was feminine and light, and often had more of an airy spring feeling than an autumnal mood. But that didn't detract from the very direct appeal of the clothes, pretty separates that were styled exactly the way one imagines they'd be worn: a chestnut cami layered under a green chiffon blouse and paired with a tweed pencil skirt; or a thin cashmere sweater worn like a shirt. Tulip-shape pockets on jackets and a skirt were alluring, as was a cashmere sweater with a pendant collar. But Yeramyan also sent models in bras and panties down the runway, a sign that she is still figuring out how to balance lingerie and ready-to-wear. And as desirable as the clothes are, they still feel more like pieces than a collection. A more intimate setting than the catwalk would have better communicated their charm.</p></div>"
16,fall,2006,f2006,badgley-mischka,"From the Queens of the Stone Age soundtrack to the skull-and-crossbones-embroidered trench that closed the show, this was not intended to be your typical stately Badgley Mischka presentation. If the results were somewhat uneven, it was good to see designers Mark Badgley and James Mischka trying to shake things up. In addition to the embroidery the duo is known for, pleats were a recurring theme, and looked good applied to tiered knee-length dresses. Daywear isn't usually a big part of the Badgley Mischka vocabulary, but there were gestures toward more trend-friendly pieces here. Best were the ruff-collared blouses and the rather chic sheared-mink miniskirts. The fur jackets were covetable, too, especially a jaunty white arctic fox one destined for Aspen.</p><p>Of course, there were plenty of the dresses that are the stuff of dreams for Oscar-nominated actresses. A midnight-blue moiré and tulle gown cut tight at the bodice had just the right amount of glittering embroidery, and a black tulle and chiffon number that trailed subtly at the back would surely send the paparazzi into a frenzy. On the other hand, one wondered where a shirred and wildly ruffled red tango gown could be worn. The Vermeer-inspired palette was saturated, said Mischka, ""200,000 percent."" Perhaps they should have knocked off a few zeros, because some of the citrons and especially the reds were jarring. But then, Badgley and Mischka clearly didn't want to play it safe this time.</p></div>"
17,fall,2006,f2006,balenciaga,"It was Balenciaga at double force: the template of Cristobal Balenciaga's past, rigorously rethought by Nicolas Ghesquière, a young designer gifted with the intellect and technical skill to propel the name to a whole new relevance. Ghesquière's woman, in her amazing wardrobe of short, molded checked tweed suits with stand-away collars, rounded coats and mind-blowingly wrought evening dresses, radiated a powerful modernity.</p><p>Elevating his models to a towering height with tall hats and vertiginous platform boots, Ghesquière's vision created extraordinary volumes and new proportions using fabrics that are rarely seen outside haute couture. The research he had done in the company's archives resulted in a surge of technical creativity that goes way beyond literal copying. He riffed at high speed through all the changes of silhouette Balenciaga developed in his 30-year career—from stiff peplumed jackets rising slightly above the waist, to simple sheaths, to elaborately surfaced Jacquard evening dresses with skirts that stand out in 3-D bubbles.</p><p>In a season when so many designers are quoting Balenciaga, Ghesquière pushed his design to a place no one else has reached. Part of it was in the intensity of the decoration involved—like the minutely beaded flowers on a white bodice, the zones of tiny ruffles outlining a shift, or the hand-painted rose-color patterning on a skirt that bloomed like an exotic flower. Equally important, though, was the way he leavened the historical reference with simple, hip pieces that stand in line with his own sensibility, like swing-back coats with the ease of a parka, his signature skinny pants, and a navy jacket that came with a cream bouclé liner—a stroke that referred back to the shearlings he's always loved. Throughout, you sensed the mark of a designer who has hit such a confident stride that, even though he has many more commercial things in the showroom—including the hugely successful Balenciaga bags—he can devote his runway to a pure distillation of ideas.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""2ealat""></div></div><p>Some of these stellar pieces will appear in the <em>Balenciaga Paris</em> exhibition that opens in July at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, juxtaposed against the original treasures culled from Cristobal Balenciaga's illustrious body of work. It's the biggest compliment to Ghesquière to say that his work will not only stand up to the comparison, but will also prove how he's bounced the history of the house back into a startling relevance for today.</p></div>"
18,fall,2006,f2006,basso-brooke,"Welcome to a grimy vault adjacent to the London Dungeon, the setting for Basso &amp; Brooke's Fall collection. While the Jack the Ripper surroundings certainly damped down the eye-searing color of their flamboyant summer collection, all the hallmarks of Bruno Basso and Christopher Brooke's deliberately schlocky aesthetics were still on full display. For starters, they trotted out a Valkyrie in a top hat, cutaway redingote, and electro-fluoro patterned leggings.</p><p>This Brazilian and British pair loves an eighties silhouette: leggings, nipped jackets, silk dresses, and big, poufy-sleeve tops. That hasn't changed, nor has their affection waned for covering every available surface in print. For fall, they dubbed their print story ""New Discoveries."" Close up, it proved to be an intricate merging of eighteenth-century etchings and surreal science and engineering illustrations, notable (for people with their reputation) for its lack of pornographic content, as well as for its darker palette of greens, browns, and purples.</p><p>""New Discoveries,"" though, had a hidden double meaning. The designers are increasingly aware of how the fashion machine works, thanks to their Italian backer Aeffe. And they're thinking seriously about proving they can do commercial, regular-looking jackets and blouses. Three seasons in, Aeffe is convinced and has signed them to another contract. So far, so good, but the ability to condense their message is still something they need to practice.</p></div>"
19,fall,2006,f2006,bcbg-max-azria,"This season, Max Azria erased the BCBG name from his runway collection, saying that he wanted to distinguish the higher-priced clothes he shows during fashion week from his more commercial line. The designer is clearly trying to stretch himself, and on the evidence of this presentation, there is some strain involved in that process. The show was nominally about beatniks, but as the intricate invitation hinted, it was also intended to be an exploration of the ways origami can be applied to fabric. Azria was thorough in his studies, applying the technique to everything from spaghetti-strap dresses with puckered bodices worn over turtlenecks to a snappy gray wool jacket with intricately formed pockets. At times, though, he got lost in the folds. This was partly due to how the girls were styled. The worst offenders were the ungainly knee-highs and the layered, droopy knits of indefinable shape, a no-no in a season where defined volumes are key.</p></div>"
20,fall,2006,f2006,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour has a knack for a little black dress. And the perfect topper. This season, the former came in jersey, cut like a second-skin trench, and the latter in a wool Empire silhouette with a face-framing Pierrot collar. There were other terrific items, too, including a cashmere cardigan overlaid with lace that was worn with Audrey Hepburn-esque tapering pants and flats, a short wool shift with puffed satin sleeves, and a pleated chiffon sheath. What these pieces had in common, right down to the palette of black, white, and heather gray, was their simplicity.</p><p>Would that Sarafpour had kept things simple. More decorative looks, like a plaid skirt with a lacy flower patched on its front, came across as prissy. Of course, ornamentation can be one of this designer's strong points. A trompe l'oeil bow tie that turned up on a silk top looked just as cute today as it did in her resort and spring collections. But that brings up a point: One would hate to see Sarafpour rest on her laurels. (Or those of other designers, for that matter: Some saw a hint of Lanvin in the velvet hourglass dresses and of vintage Thierry Mugler in the lace-up, stacked-heel boots they were paired with.) Hopefully, after a strong spring season, she is just taking a breather before refocusing her energies.</p></div>"
21,fall,2006,f2006,bill-blass,"The Vadim wives who inspired last season's show were nowhere to be seen at Bill Blass today, but socialites young and old were on hand to watch Michael Vollbracht ""channel,"" as he says, the spirit of the label's namesake. Vollbracht and Blass must have had a long conversation, because there were a lot of clothes (55 looks) on the runway. There were (way too literal) Tippi Hedren-style suits with ungainly belts, numerous coats (many in double-faced cashmere or shearling), a series of LBDs and, of course, event-friendly evening gowns (the best a red chiffon halter dress). Unfortunately most of the looks were shown with nude stockings, which, as one attendee was heard remarking, ""instantly add 20 years.""</p><p>Vollbracht closed the show with a very pretty bridal gown, an old-fashioned gesture that referenced a once-common tradition. Perhaps he should revive another, and show in a gilt-chaired salon setting instead of the circus atmosphere of the tents. It might do service to the clothes, better showing the fabrics and the craftsmanship that go into making, say, the hand-woven Lesage-beaded ivory gown Inguna Butane wore. Sometimes such things get lost in the fast-paced atmosphere of Bryant Park.</p></div>"
22,fall,2006,f2006,blumarine,"Anna Molinari's Blumarine is a perfect embodiment of a certain Italian woman's attitude toward fashion: Let the rest of the world worry about sobriety, not her. What's the point in clothes if they don't make her feel decorative? Dresses and elaborate knitwear are ever the core of Molinari's commercial success, so she took the coat-and-minidress combo that is one of the looks of the season, but tweaked it to show off all the pieces that make her customers happy. A sliver of gold dévoré velvet with a fox-trimmed coat thrown over it started a show of slinky jersey and body-hugging mini sweater dresses. She thought up things to do with her line of embellished cardigans, too, trimming a turquoise one in fur and embroidery, and making another in multiple cream crochet ruffles.</p><p>Midway, Molinari turned on the power suits, though a couple of evening coats, one in tailored brocade and the other a black velvet swing with a white fur collar, proved to be the stronger pieces. The long evening dresses made of randomly attached assemblages of tattered lace and chiffon looked more like borrowings from her daughter's younger Anna Molinari line, but otherwise, this collection was just as it always is: reassuringly pretty things to keep the ladies loyal.</p></div>"
23,fall,2006,f2006,bottega-veneta,"Tomas Maier's version of twenty-first-century no-logo stealth-wealth is proving a runaway success at Bottega Veneta. The evidence of that has always been easy to spot in stores (where the pliable woven surfaces of his ultraluxurious handcrafted bags are obvious to the eye and touch), and in the exponentially expanding bottom line of the BV profit sheet. For the first few seasons, though, Maier's quiet message didn't quite carry to the runway. But his initial awkwardness with the concept of managing a top-to-toe look is, with this collection, showing signs of disappearing.</p><p>Maier's growing self-confidence has helped him relax into what he's best at: pared-down clothes whose cut and fabric speak for themselves. ""There's no embellishment, no fur, no embroidery,"" he said. In a season of gray jersey and pantsuits, he was on home territory. He sculpted the former into two ultraprecise multiseamed day dresses, and two short draped goddess gowns for evening. Unlined neat jackets and wide pants, meanwhile, were treated to a turn in the washing machine to produce a luxuriously rumpled effect. Those were followed by shadow-painted plaid kilts with a sparkle in the pleats, and matching jackets—yet more items on the checklist of interesting pieces for Bottega's moneyed customers to inspect, come fall.</p><p>The kicker is that Maier is investing plenty of decorative punch in his accessories. It's a smart move that reflects the way most women actually dress today, and double-smart for a house that knows its customer's insatiable hunger for unique, hard-to-identify, and extremely expensive items. To that end, the Bottega woven bags now come with flowers sprouting from the interstices, and are framed with brass hardware featuring Fabergé-inspired engravings. This season also sees the launch of Bottega Veneta fine jewelry, a collection that includes intricately braided chains made of 18-karat yellow and white gold, cuffs, and charm bracelets that up the luxury ante in a way that will no doubt delight the high-spenders Maier already has in his thrall.</p></div>"
24,fall,2006,f2006,boudicca,"""Mind-boggling—in a good way,"" is how one editor described Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby's remarkable Boudicca collection. Titled <em>An Invisible City,</em> this was the most pure—if somewhat indulgent—distillation to date of the label's vision. Never one to understate matters, Broach described that goal backstage as a quest ""to forge the identity of a future of design that is not just about making clothes, but the craftsmanship.""</p><p>As with most Boudicca collections, this one was about breaking down categories and conventions. Broach and Kirkby dissected shirts and tuxedos to come up with boleros made from the collar and shoulders of a jacket; strap-on waistcoats; skirts with attached vests; and shirts with jacket lapels. Some were more conceptual than wearable, but others—a leather jacket styled like a shirt, a sharp trouser, a high-neck shirt—weren't.</p><p>The real drama of the collection, though, came from the designers' attempt to, as they put it, ""challenge the pleat,"" folding material to create astounding architectural constructions. Something that looked like a (relatively) straightforward suit from the front, for instance, was likely to be sporting a bustle at back. Seen from the side, the models, surrounded by fans of pleats, looked like intergalactic Degas dancers—just the kind of girls one might expect to find in an invisible city.</p></div>"
25,fall,2006,f2006,brian-reyes,"When Brian Reyes introduced his line last spring, he seemed to be inspired by the ladylike aesthetic of former employer Oscar de la Renta. For fall, though, he changed tactics completely, surprising and disappointing many.</p><p>Reyes said he wanted to apply lightness (usually a spring concept) to fall clothes, but somehow this translated into transparency. The overexposure was unceasing from start to finish, and it was as detrimental to the collection as it would be to an A-list star in the glare of photographers' flashbulbs.</p><p>It was possible to see what Reyes might have been going for in one outfit: a delicately beaded tulle top paired with a veiled bubble skirt, but even that left <em>la belle poitrine</em> on view. The most covered-up look was a trench with a belt threaded through to form a tented back, but unnecessarily, there were three of those, just as there were repetitious pant-and-blouse combos. Hopefully, this was just an example of sophomore slump, and Reyes will recover his next time out.</p></div>"
26,fall,2006,f2006,brioni,"Established in Rome in 1945 by master tailor Nazareno Fonticoli and fashion designer Gaetano Savini, Brioni—named after an Adriatic resort—has become synonymous with top-notch menswear, attracting customers like Gary Cooper, Kofi Annan, and of course, Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. In 2001, the company ventured into womenswear, and this season marks the debut of Spanish designer Cristina Ortiz, an alum of Lanvin, Prada, and MaxMara. Inspired, she said, by ""round, sensual"" forms, Ortiz imagined not a woman who would wear men's clothes, but rather a ""companion to the Brioni man."" This translated into a sharp black trench with a high collar and puff sleeves, and some body-loving dresses, as well as some dissections of the smoking. Rendered mostly in black (""to get my message across quickly""), with touches of red, the collection was best at its strictest and, appropriately for Brioni, most tailored.</p></div>"
27,fall,2006,f2006,burberry-prorsum,"Christopher Bailey has figured out the one thing he has to do above all else at Burberry: Keep the trench hot, of course. He did exactly that from the first exit: a rumpled, classic old mac that was luxed up with bands of fox at the hem and cuff. That set the template for a collection he said was based on photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; the show had a couture-ish kind of sensibility, lightened up with, as he put it, ""that sloppy way of wearing things only young British girls have. Sloppy is good.""</p><p>In the country, Wallis Simpson might've worn English checks, so Bailey set about fashioning double-breasted coat dresses with deep pockets, worn with nutty cable-knit hats. Thinking more about the Duchess' extended sojourn in Paris, perhaps, he came up with wool trenches smothered in mink from belt to hem, as well as skimpily delicate ecru and black chantilly lace versions for a notional dinner at Maxim's. He also brought in a lot of Burberry in-house symbolism along the way, making classic country jacket quilting jump from bags to leather jackets to velvet evening coats, and using the leather-covered D-ring of the raincoat belt on cylindrical-heel pumps and bags. The gold-link bracelets and the new oversize sunglass frames offered more evidence of Burberry's burgeoning product lines.</p><p>Classic with playful, casual with dressy, young with grown-up—that made for another season well done as Bailey hurried backstage to say ""Hello, mate"" to Kate Moss in front of an avalanche of photographers. It's not unimpressive, what he's achieving here. That such a whippersnapper has been able to turn the frumpy old country lady's Burberry into a fashionable thing for the first time in its 150 years is in fact something of a cause for national pride in Britain. And it's that new energy as much as the milestone itself that the brand is celebrating this year.</p></div>"
28,fall,2006,f2006,calvin-klein-collection,"After last season's air conditioner breakdown and the swelter that ensued, the Calvin Klein team was in the market for a new show venue. The minimal white West 39th Street space they opted for today may not have been the very last word in comfort, but it was a huge improvement over Milk Studios. Kudos then to whoever oversaw the switch in location—and to Francisco Costa, whose fall collection, if not as strong as his spring breakthrough, was a competitive runner-up. The Brazilian designer is in his seventh season with the house, and perhaps it's time to stop counting. He's charting his own course now.</p><p>Costa can work a theme like nobody's business. His last go-around, it was circles; for fall, he zeroed in on herringbone. At its most basic, that meant cutting full trousers in the traditional menswear fabric, but this was not a collection about basics. Dress after airy dress was embroidered with V-shape patterns of varying sizes, picked out in wool or bugle beads, and several were real stunners. Take, for instance, the pair of fire-engine-red chiffon gowns that closed the show, or another number in black and brown that cascaded below the knee in wool box pleats, then hobbled above the ankle. It had substance, unlike some of the lighter-weight gowns, which wandered a little too close to lingerie territory. At retail, linings will be in order; apart from anything else, these are fall clothes. More traditionally seasonal in vein were a series of black wool-crepe coats with wide cuffs, inverted pleats on the sleeves, and trapeze hems. They showcased Costa's skills as a tailor and left the audience hankering for a few more suits with that same attention to luxe detail.</p></div>"
29,fall,2006,f2006,carolina-herrera,"This time of year, designers have the red carpet in mind. And who can blame them, with all the attention the media lavishes on awards season? But Carolina Herrera knows there are many other occasions that aren't simulcast to millions worldwide, yet still call for the sort of polished, important clothes in which she specializes—take weddings, black-tie galas, or simply dinner at 8. Judging by the happy post-show murmurings of her front-row clients, there will be plenty of jeweled silk faille boleros and sheared-mink turtlenecks at Daniel come fall.</p><p>Herrera took her inspiration from such late-1950's icons as Claudia Cardinale in <em>The Pink Panther</em> and Jeanne Moreau in <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>. But whatever the back story, there was a modern ease to these clothes. A black-and-chocolate sheath came with whimsical sheered-mink sleeves, while skirtsuits, shown in red double-face wool, plaid, and a Prince of Wales check, had a softness that belied their inner structure. Crystal-studded cocktail dresses can look straight out of the vintage shop, but Herrera invigorated hers with unfussy, sexy cuts. Opaque tights lent an element of youth to a chiffon gown, whose hip-high slit might elsewhere have bordered on bad taste, but here looked fresh.</p><p>Similarly, only someone with Herrera's deft touch could pull off the bold patterns and daring color combinations that ran through the collection. It takes a savvy confidence to pair a violet corset boasting chocolate ribbon detailing with a red floral floor-length skirt. This season, Herrera is dining out on it.</p></div>"
30,fall,2006,f2006,catherine-malandrino,"The lure of a Mary J. Blige mini-concert attracted a larger than usual crowd Friday night to the Malandrino show. Despite a tiered, rotating stage that made serious viewing something of a challenge for most of the audience, everyone went home happy—thanks not only to the R&amp;B queen's feel-good vibes, but also because Malandrino sent out a collection that was free of the exotic touches that last season distracted from her pretty message.</p><p>For fall, she embraced a muted palette of chocolate, black, ivory, and silver, which she quilted, embroidered, and crocheted in her signature style to mostly subtle effect. If the proportions of a few looks—a bulky satin parka, say—verged on the old-ladyish, she made up for it with a houndstooth bouclé suit belted with insouciance. A pair of silvery-white gowns, meanwhile, had just the right mix of youth and sophistication.</p></div>"
31,fall,2006,f2006,celine,"What does Celine stand for? It's been two seasons since Ivana Omazic was installed at the French house, replacing Roberto Menichetti, who, in turn, took the design reins from Michael Kors. Her grace period is up, without a clear indication that she¿s capable of answering that tough question. Tough because, let's face it, both of her more seasoned predecessors were just as unsure about how the future of this once well-known handbag brand should proceed.</p><p>To be fair, her new collection compared favorably to a spring line that suffered from too loud colors, a numbing repetitiveness, and an over-reliance on styling tricks. (Although this show had the latter, too, in the form of wooden bangles stacked seven to a wrist.) One positive development here was the way the herringbone suits with portrait collars and cropped pants riffed on the current menswear trend. Her trenches could stand up to those of her competitors, too. And the show's wide crocodile belts will make a sexy contribution to that crowded category.</p><p>More frequently, though, Omazic went astray. In a season when fur is key, there were but two minks on her runway, and—curiously for a fall show—she sent out a seemingly endless parade of breezy chiffon, most of it in that fast-becoming-overexposed color combo, nude and black, or not much better, turquoise. And where were the bags? An oversize duffel does not an accessories business make. Her audience will take a lot of convincing, but let's hope the third time's the charm for this newcomer.</p></div>"
32,fall,2006,f2006,central-saint-martins,"Central Saint Martins' M.A. degree show is always good, but the Class of 2006 exploded onto the London runway with such a sustained display of individual excellence (19 collections and not a dud among them) that the graduation presentation became the spectacle of the week. The headhunters who fish this elite international fashion gene pool scribbled constantly, checking names from Britain, Scandinavia, Israel, Japan, Germany, and Eastern Europe. Anna-Sara Davik reinvented the humble nylon mackintosh with whooshing ruffles and a floating train. Leili Morshed draped jersey into chic gray wool dresses. Alexis Giboin cut navy and black taffeta into scallop-edged, big-sleeved silhouettes, cinched with enameled owls. And Lisa Pritchard printed gold and silver lamé into multilayered tiers of fan pleats.</p><p>If there were trends, they were in the collective fascination for folds, knots, and pleats, and for experimenting with the classic trench (Molly Grad, Diasuke Okuyama, Lisa Pritchard). But it was the sheer conviction of these graduate students that was truly impressive. Menswear designer Dennis Jansson, for one, sent out such a believable gang of dirty-denimed bikers that they might've parked their Harleys outside. As for the prizes in this vintage year, they were swept up by Christopher Kane. The 23-year-old Glaswegian showed a series of extraordinary short dresses made from intricately worked frills, stretch lace, and lashings of nylon jingling with gold rings—a look that pushed good/bad taste to a whole new frontier. Afterward, Kane's pieces were shipped directly to Harrods, where they will be stopping window-shopping tourists in their tracks throughout the week. The next generation of young British fashion—crazed with creativity and boasting an astonishing level of professionalism—has just taken off.</p></div>"
33,fall,2006,f2006,chaiken,"The Chaiken line has its celebrity fans—Alec Baldwin, Julianna Margulies, and Illeana Douglas were all present today—but Jeff Mahshie and Julie Chaiken's fall collection was aimed squarely at their customer, not their front row. The show was full of modern everyday pieces that would work equally well in the office or at the Mercer Bar. (Despite Mary-Louise Parker's recent endorsement at the Golden Globes, they eschewed big-statement evening looks.)</p><p>The palette was succinct. Inspired by the painter Oscar Bluemner, whose work is currently on view at the Whitney, it focused on gray, red, navy, and camel. Silhouettes were also kept to a minimum: skinny pants, capes, Eton jackets, and scoop-neck dresses in jersey and wools. The tightness of the show was both its strength and its weakness: There was consistency of vision, but it was also repetitive, relying too heavily on one or two tricks (the frog closures used for ornamentation, for example). Still, with so many frills everywhere else for fall, it was undeniably refreshing to see such a clean collection.</p></div>"
34,fall,2006,f2006,chalayan,"The saying ""I've become part of the furniture"" sprang to mind at Hussein Chalayan's show. Not that it meant you could be overlooked while wearing his clothes: How could you be, in a jacket whose rolled, stuffed-leather collar was a chunk of padding, lifted directly from a gentlemen's club armchair? This opening image, however, turned out not to be an overture to a presentation of disconcerting conceptualism: Chalayan has grown out of that. His collection still showed its intellectual roots, but it was full of things that a smart woman will want to wear this fall.</p><p>Chalayan aficionados know that he's incorporated parts of fighter-plane seats, wooden coffee tables, and carpets into clothes before. This time, however, he abstracted his comfortable upholstery components—and the polished surfaces of Victorian sideboards—into beautiful clothes that don't demand too much cerebral heavy lifting. Those exaggerated collars, for a start, happen to interlock neatly with the season's obsession with swathed, built-up necklines; the short, waisted coats below them are also sharply in step with fashion. Add to that Chalayan's double-wedge boots (whose soles suggested the rubber stops of a computer desk) and his use of plush velvet quilting and nail-head studding: all personal interpretations of current trends.</p><p>In the end, what matters is that Chalayan's methodology can produce such right-on silhouettes as a leather-collared tweed blouson with a pleated mini-kilt, or his light-handed, pretty dress made of paneled, wood-grain-printed silk. Definitely not designed for women who want to blend into the domestic background.</p></div>"
35,fall,2006,f2006,chanel,"Karl Lagerfeld's ability to stretch the template of Chanel this way and that according to the moment never ceases. This season, the block-heeled sixties spectator boot he first showed for couture gave him the starting point to design upward into a young and leggy look. Let <em>les autres</em> turn to the omnipresent Balenciaga influence; for Lagerfeld, there's no need to look beyond the Rue Cambon for a reason to make a newly proportioned short tweed suit. Just as it was in the fifties and sixties when Coco competed with Cristobal, now Chanel's slim coats and jackets, worn with ruffled blouses and jewel-buckled belts, represent the authentically sourced Paris alternative to the oft-quoted architectural volumes of Signor B.</p><p>Though it was mainly black, with touches of white, cream, and dull pink, Lagerfeld's collection didn't come off as one of the season's solemn pronouncements on sobriety and restraint. Instead, he worked texture, sparkle, and girlishness into surfaces and styling: He used satin ribbons and bows for hair bands and bodices, raw edgings on hems, and gemstones and crystals set in big brooches or as bejeweled necklines set into evening dresses. As a contemporary twist on the classic Chanel bag he added an oversize unstructured hand-held tote—something like a laundry bag, but in patent leather, with a short chain handle.</p><p>As always, the Chanel presentation zipped pell-mell through many options. There were simple sleeveless little black dresses and short redingotes, flared from the waist (the best in plain herringbone tweed). For evening, Lagerfeld checked off more points of the season, from exaggerated puff-sleeves to sixties Edie-ish baby dolls and various renderings of chiffon dresses layered over trousers. Cute and young was the general impression, but—no surprise—Lagerfeld also ensured that classic Chanel's all-encompassing sweep remained firmly in the mind's eye.</p></div>"
36,fall,2006,f2006,chloe,"High-end fashion collections cannot be directed by committee, period. That ineluctable fact thudded onto the Chloé runway in exit one: a shapeless greige mac thrown over a frilled blouse and a pair of khaki pants hanging soggily from suspenders—a look finished with a pair of clunky bottines. Two or three more outfits—a couple of loose artist's smocks and a gray-olive wool dress layered over trousers—and it was clear that this collection was not about to snap with the vivacious, girl-friendly energy that Phoebe Philo brought to the house.</p><p>It would be exaggerating to call it definitively ugly—though a pair of giant overalls and saggy-backed, folded-front turn-up pants were close calls. The trouble is more that Chloé, for so long a pacesetter of perfectly thrown-together personal style, has now inevitably decelerated into the league of followers. Without the instinctive drive of a strong designer, team-driven analysis tends to look outside, see what other people are doing, and come up with a general trend consensus. Thus, the contents of Chloé now have shades of Marc Jacobs' latest layerings (shorts over pants) and hints of Marni-cum-Yohji abstract shapes (loose-waisted, hopsacky things), while anxiously hanging on to last season's baby doll to keep up the label's continuity.</p><p>In this interim period, there will certainly be pieces to keep things ticking over—the little blouses and some pretty party dresses detailed with haphazard ripples of chiffon pleats. Looking ahead, it may be impossible to replicate the exact quality of casual cool that Philo brought to this label, because that belonged to her alone. But that's not to say another designer can't do something equally exciting in their own way. To keep Chloé cooking, that change needs to happen, and fast.</p></div>"
37,fall,2006,f2006,christian-dior,"<em>Kerrang</em>! The Christian Dior woman has turned into a goth-metal rock chick, all black bandana, major shades, fur-sprouting distressed leathers and stompin' medieval biker boots. With Pat Benatar and Bon Jovi on the soundtrack, and a front row that included Kate Hudson and Black Crowes hubby Chris Robinson, John Galliano turned the ultra-establishment Grand Palais de Paris into a fashion-rock stadium for the night. (Well, 20 minutes of it).</p><p>For anyone with an eye for recent history, this was Galliano up to familiar tricks. The identically wigged, long-haired rocker women on the runway were—stylistically at least—slightly more contemporary sisters to the blood-spattered nineteenth-century zealots who appeared in Dior's French Revolutionary haute couture show for spring. This fall collection made the trickle-down effect from fantasy to nuts-and-bolts ready-to-wear more understandable than in seasons past. Galliano's voluminous, floor-sweeping coats with huge, shaggy goat-hair tufts escaping from their seams, and his neat jackets, decorated with vertical strips of fur, will translate into plenty of sellable pieces for the boutiques of the world to carry.</p><p>More surprisingly, but just as cleverly, Galliano also slipped in references to Christian Dior's 1947 New Look jacket—here in a peplumed shape, or covered with tulle in the front. Those suits, with their artfully tattered and embroidered surfaces and second-skin pencil skirts, have a certain delicacy that is guaranteed to register with the more hyper-feminine Dior customer Galliano knows so well. Oddly enough, they also made a connection with the eighties power suit; a look that is preoccupying the young—and the not-so-young—on Planet Fashion this season.</p></div>"
38,fall,2006,f2006,christian-lacroix,"The distance Christian Lacroix is putting between his fantastic haute couture extravaganzas and his more accessible ready-to-wear line is now, quite literally, measurable in inches—12, that is, above the knee. That describes the divide between the old image Lacroix has been sitting with since the eighties—an honored place at the table of the Ladies Who Lunch—and the one he wants now: dancing on those tabletops with the It Girls with Legs.</p><p>The radically cropped lengths of his tunics, skirts and shorts—all shown with black tights and suede boots—are a plain declaration that Lacroix is out to grab a new audience. Will the girls get it? Maybe. In a season when so much somber clothing will end up hanging in stores, the rich, multi-patterned, shimmery surfaces of Lacroix's pieces could glow like a beacon in the darkness: Other than the radical crops, the man is staying true to his Anadalusian/Parisian colors.</p><p>So that no one could miss the reference to his aesthetic roots, Lacroix played a vintage video of bullfighting scenes as a backdrop, while out trotted a black-and-white scarf-print shift and coat with matching lining, a strapless paisley-print bubble dress, and a hot-pink brocade coat with a black lace overlay. The designer had worked hard to translate many of the touches of his couture here; witness the deep bands of jet-beaded Spanish embroidery in a bodice and the fur cap-sleeves set into an antiqued-gold brocade shift. As alternative partywear for girls who don't want to blend into the background, it might just catch on with today's generation the way it did with their mothers—though, thankfully this time, poufs and shoulder pads aren't involved.</p></div>"
39,fall,2006,f2006,comme-des-garcons,"The key to Rei Kawakubo's collection was, she said, thinking about ""the persona—what's in front, and what's behind."" In other words, she cut her clothes—and extraordinary Venice carnival masks—into a visual essay on the complexities of the disguises we construct to represent ourselves to the world. Kawakubo's meaning snapped into focus with the arresting sight of a masked woman in a fedora, advancing along the runway wearing what looked like a man's coat with a huge, ruffled cape cascading from the shoulders. As operatic arias filled a lofty, chandeliered room at the Sorbonne, it was the beginning of a powerful study on masculinity and femininity—and the everyday theater of getting dressed.</p><p>Each of Kawakubo's outfits contained fusions of menswear and frilled silk and baroque Jacquard elements culled from Victorian women's clothing. Some of the tailored jackets were slashed under the lapels, with decorative fabrics forcing their way out from within; others were patchworks of flower-printed dress fabric at the front and plain suiting at the back, or had overblown leg-of-mutton silk sleeves attached to mens' argyle cardigans. The more conceptual opening passages of the show resolved themselves into some brilliant but wearable looks along the way. One, a checked tweed pantsuit, had a black corset implanted in the torso; another, a silky russet puffed-sleeve dress had a transplant of suit lapels at the neck.</p><p>It made for an impressive performance that saw Kawakubo pulling something rich, romantic, and dramatically new out of the recognizable materials of her own past body of work. That in itself made for a satisfying spectacle, while the way the collection glancingly referenced current subjects—such as the tension between male and female relationships, and the stylistic interest in suiting, baroque fabrics and Victorian sleeves—demonstrated Kawakubo's innately individual way of connecting with the fashion debate.</p></div>"
40,fall,2006,f2006,costello-tagliapietra,"You could look at Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra's new collection and say that not much has changed. But that's probably just fine with the New York duo's devoted fans. They'd prefer to keep Costello Tagliapietra's skimmy jersey dresses a secret, to ooh and ahh among themselves about a frill of pleats at mid-thigh, a new shirred neckline, or the tiny buttons that render a provocative slit demure.</p><p>However, a growing clique of fashion insiders does not a business make. So in addition to elevating the quiet charms of their fall silhouettes—wraps, halter gowns, and sheaths, mostly—with exquisite lace linings, the designers are continuing to add more sportswear separates to their mix. Sturdy moleskin trousers set off a delicate David Hockney-blue sleeveless top very well, but a coat cut from the same fabric that hit at the hips looked boxy; the knee-length version had more swing.</p><p>Just when you might have expected them to expand on these ideas, a fox jacket and a raccoon capelet ended Costello Tagliapietra's small collection. If they're committed to growing bigger, the designers will have to spend less time on such fluff, luxe though it may be, and focus more on pieces like the great-looking gathered-shoulder top and slim skirt that were almost obscured by a fur muff.</p></div>"
41,fall,2006,f2006,costume-national,"In his program notes, Costume National's Ennio Capasa suggested that the rock chick he dressed in the nineties has grown up. Unfortunately, the designer seems to think that growing up means losing your edge, judging from his uncharacteristically muted fall show. Despite experimenting with both long and short, eighties-tight and sixties-loose, suggestive and naïve, the collection felt a bit repetitive. There were eminently wearable minicoats, trenches, and the season's de rigueur half-wool/half-fur overcoat, but they lacked a recognizable identity that will make women seek them out.</p><p>Pants, once a Costume National strong suit with their masculine yet sexy fit, inexplicably came with pleats beginning at the top of the thigh. They're as likely to see the light of day as the stiff leather floor-grazing skirt that was also shown. Thankfully, for evening Capasa took a more sensual approach. He mostly abandoned last season's superfluous jeweled embellishments—save for one sleek sheath that was fully beaded in front and plain in back—and focused on cut. Bustier dresses were fitted to just above the knee, as were his skirt suits, and he threw in a couple of voile gowns. The stronger of the two came with braided straps and fell in soft tiers to the floor—at last a hint of what grown-up rock chic might look like.</p></div>"
42,fall,2006,f2006,d-g,"There's always someone at Milan's Fall shows who feels compelled to lay on a snow scene. This time, it was D&amp;G's Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana. No doubt inspired by the Winter Olympics just up the road in Turin, they whipped together a winter-wonderland forest scene, complete with falling synthetic snow that sprinkled the black-clad shoulders of a none-too-delighted audience.</p><p>No surprise, the girls who gamboled out were a troupe of ski bunnies, working head-to-toe knits in white. As a device, this was potentially annoying, especially when a sleigh-load of Santa's helpers arrived to hand out Christmas candy (not that welcome, actually, in February). Still, there was enough believable commercial fashion in the chunky cable-knit ponchos, oversize tam-o-shanters, cowl-neck mini sweater dresses, and pompom accessories to almost justify the kitsch of it all.</p></div>"
43,fall,2006,f2006,daryl-k,"A scheduling snafu prevented many from seeing Daryl K's fall runway presentation, which is regrettable because it was one of her best. A blanket-wool coat with a bubble hem, topped with a tasseled beret, set the mood for a collection of relaxed and layered separates. Cocoon coats and kimono jackets came in cozy flannel and cashmere, while dresses and so-called slinky sweatshirts were done in jersey. Kerrigan styled the show with her usual ease, throwing archival and custom pieces into the mix.</p><p>The designer said she conceived the collection for ""the same cool, rock 'n' roll woman who's always been my muse: She's grown up, but she hasn't grown old."" That made for a presentation that was accomplished and clear in expression. Dresses were a focus this season. Nothing floaty, mind; Kerrigan opted instead for a ""restrained"" look, gathered at the waist and knee. Standouts were a chestnut silk number and another in black with button placket detailing. Alongside these ""punky couture"" dresses, she showed staples like wrap tops, pencil skirts, and, of course, leggings. Kerrigan has had her share of business woes, but this collection suggests that she's on an upswing at last.</p></div>"
44,fall,2006,f2006,derek-lam,"""It's about New York at night, racing through Times Square in a cab and seeing only flashes of color,"" said Derek Lam of the influences behind his latest show. From the very first look—a cowl-neck sweater worn with a ruffle shirt, black leggings, and killer leather booties—this new collection made Lam's spring sojourn in Hawaii look rather mild. As the old saying goes, there's no place like home.</p><p>Leggings were an important building block for the fall line, functioning as a sexy, minimalist pedestal of sorts, upon which to display his fabulous outerwear. A maxi-length trench with silver fox cuffs rendered his popular crinkle-cotton version from a few seasons back immediately obsolete. Capes, too, are becoming a signature. Lam did long and short versions in salt-and-pepper tweed, as well as evening styles. One was lavishly embroidered with velvet rosettes, another came in ruffled stripes of black dévoré.</p><p>Cocktail hour was where those Times Square colors kicked in. Fall's must-have one-shoulder silhouette came in turquoise laundered georgette, and sunshine-yellow or kelly-green bodices topped gold jacquard and black crepe skirts, respectively. What Lam lacked in showstopping gowns—there was only one, in crepe chiffon—he more than made up for with details like jet beading. The result: his strongest collection to date.</p></div>"
45,fall,2006,f2006,diane-von-furstenberg,"Despite a soundtrack that included Dolly Parton singing ""9 to 5"" and Irene Cara belting out ""What a Feeling,"" Diane von Furstenberg's fall show wasn't as much about the eighties as it was about strong female archetypes. Dubbed <em>Working Girl</em>, the collection alternated between sharp, little forties suits in houndstooth knits—think sexy secretary—and bold patchwork serapes à la pioneering frontier woman.</p><p>There were also plenty of wrap dresses, the item that set von Furstenberg on her own fiercely independent path three decades ago. These were joined by shirtdresses in everything from a Navajo-striped chiffon to a leopard print to polka dots (the best came in a navy wool jersey). Pants, that modern woman's must-have basic, were paradoxically lacking. The few times they did show up, with a vest and a bow-front blouse, they were full in the leg and cuffed. Mink-trimmed booties weren't likely to introduce a note of practicality, but there's no denying they're sexy, as DVF's program notes urged us to be, ""every day, all day…""</p><p>After last season's accident at her studio, in which a rack of stage lights fell on the audience, von Furstenberg moved her act to the Bryant Park tents. Judging by the leisurely stroll she took around the U-shaped runway, she felt at home in her new surroundings. As she greeted celebrity friends like Susan Sarandon, Charlie Rose, Diane Sawyer, and Mike Nichols (who as it happens directed the show's namesake movie), it was apparent that this is one working girl who loves her job.</p></div>"
46,fall,2006,f2006,dkny,"After several seasons showing DKNY in the restaurant du jour—Pastis, Lever House—Donna Karan brought her secondary line back to the runway for fall, specifically to her late husband Stephan Weiss' Greenwich Street studio, the location of her signature-collection shows. She didn't give in to convention entirely, because there was no assigned seating, which caused more than a few gripes. Most people, though, were delighted with the change in venue. ""It's brilliant to see the clothes moving on a body,"" concluded one editor. Karan, who watched the show from the bleachers, demurred: ""Brilliant, I don't know. But a runway show is what everyone's been asking for.""</p><p>Of course, DKNY is about giving the people what they want, and Karan has paid close attention to the young urban woman's current uniform. Hence, the presence of such cool accessories as wide, waist-cinching belts, opaque tights, engineer caps, and silk ribbons to tie around the neck. From there, she explored masculine/feminine juxtapositions like peacoats and boyfriend sweaters paired with flippy bubble minis or a puff-sleeve blouse teamed with a man's vest and gauchos. When the looks weren't monochromatic in deep shades of navy, chocolate, and black, colors were thrown together with schoolgirl naiveté. Those ""spontaneous"" combinations seemed like a concession to the catwalk, not something that would necessarily fly in real life. That's where Karan's crinkle-silk dresses, some tissue-padded for extra volume, came in. Layer one over a little tank or top it with a shrunken cardigan and you're out the door.</p></div>"
47,fall,2006,f2006,dolce-gabbana,"Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce are advancing into fall with Napoleonic zeal—literally. At the start of their show, a tableau of hussars and Empire beauties rose into view on a revolving plinth, arranged around a ceremonial black monolith emblazoned with the Emperor's laurels. The Napoleonic codebook gave them all the historical ammunition they needed to cut a swath through current themes: the play between masculine and feminine; the baroque flourishes; the rich velvets and antique golds; the swaggering capes and high-collar shirts. Naturally, they also had carte blanche to do things with raised-waist dresses, the Empire line pioneered by Josephine herself.</p><p>Military tailcoats, cut in shearling, along with tight knickers and jodhpurs with high riding boots marched out, followed by legions of coats in brown and beige, all detailed with gold buttons or leather straps and brass hardware transplanted from saddlery. These designers have always loved a baby-doll, and this season's are their most sumptuous yet—lovely little puff-sleeve things in eau de nil, emerald, and vibrant red velvet or old-gold brocade. Streaks of silver paint glinted in the gathers of one; others had bands of gold-thread military embroidery circling bosoms; yet another was held up with an imperial-medal chain.</p><p>It's fair to point out that none of this is necessarily fresh territory in fashion (John Galliano, for one, has staked it out before). Yet Dolce <em>e</em> Gabbana applied such intense workmanship here that they engraved their own signature on the plot (note the gold crown placed above the D&amp;G initials on bags and T-shirts).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""e7pkx""></div></div><p>The triumphal mood culminated in a velvet-slippered procession of court ladies straight out of <em>The Coronation of Napoleon in Notre Dame</em>, the 1804 painting by David that hangs in the Louvre. Tucked among the sheer, gem- and pearl-embroidered numbers, there were two extraordinary gowns with skirts made of layered feathers—one painted to look like leopard spots, the other gilded with antique gold. These qualified as top trophies in the Dolce &amp; Gabbana campaign to dominate the red carpet.</p></div>"
48,fall,2006,f2006,donna-karan,"Donna Karan went back to the archives for her fall inspirations. Bodysuits and leggings—both elements of the Seven Easy Pieces equation that launched her brand 20-plus years ago—formed a kind of backbone for the collection, from which tulip skirts and similarly full dresses and coats could bloom. The show wasn't all about proportion-play; in a stretch-silk tuxedo jacket and stretch-wool trousers, the model Vlada looked as if she could slip through the cracks in the sidewalk. But this, and a few other exits like it, seemed little more than concessions to the current craze for pantsuits. Karan's real passion is for dresses—when was the last time you saw the designer in anything else?</p><p>Last season's tenting freefall dresses made appearances here, but they were reworked so that the fabric draped from the shoulders to reveal the sash in back. Thanks to bodysuits with trompe l'oeil bodices, and nipped-waist sheaths with net insets, there was yet more flesh on display. Provocative, yes, but perfectly tasteful, and the former, at least, won't likely make it to stores without linings anyway. What will arrive unchanged is Karan's outerwear. A gold leather trench with extra-wide lapels and an hourglass white alpaca with a funnel neck were both memorable, but the standout was a coat made from thousands of tiny leather paillettes.</p></div>"
49,fall,2006,f2006,doo-ri,"Doo-Ri Chung made a name for herself with her drapey, fluid jersey dresses, but she's not afraid to spread her wings. Last season, she explored other evening materials, like satin and charmeuse, and now for fall, she's experimenting with such menswear staples as wool melton, houndstooth, and plaid. The task she set herself here was the difficult one of reimagining the suit, replacing the jacket's sharp lines with soft ones, cutting bell sleeves, and tenting the back. It could have looked old-fashioned; instead, it came off as refreshingly modern, a welcome sight at a time when a number of Chung's peers seem stuck in the past (pick your decade).</p><p>For evening, she mostly avoided structure and instead pushed her draping skills to new heights, embellishing dresses with crafty touches like crochet, macramé, and rosettes. One wool number tented from the neckline to the floor with only metal paillettes at the waist interrupting its long, flowing lines. Another, in champagne silk twill, was overlaid with weightless net that was attached below the bust with a cluster of crystals. These are not gowns destined for the dance floor—they're far too precious—but rather for grand, sweeping entrances and exits, and only then if your date is a gent and agrees to mind your train.</p></div>"
50,fall,2006,f2006,dries-van-noten,"A heavy brown curtain obscured the runway as Dries Van Noten's guests ambled to their seats. There were cakes and ginger tea on offer, and the proceedings had the feeling of a cocktail party, despite the early hour. When the partitions finally lifted, the audience was dazzled by what seemed like acres of delicate gold leaf (flecks of which could be found in the preshow treats) and a fall collection that was equal parts Eastern splendor and somber masculinity.</p><p>In less able hands, the combination could have proved jarring, or forced at the very least. But forced isn't Van Noten's style. Starting with the first look—a boxy jacket, sashed high across the bust, and a colorful skirt edged with gold thread—it was a happy marriage. From the East came tapestry fabrics, bullion embroidery, and a crescent-moon print in cream and cherry red; from a tailor's arsenal there were cummerbunds, trenches, and small, fitted jackets tucked into high-waisted, cropped pants that—in a season of suits—managed to be surprisingly original. If the tapered-hem sack dresses and cardigans with their arms tied across the torso seemed too familiar, they touched on the current trends for egg shapes and layering, without diverging much from Van Noten's own artsy vocabulary. All in all, this collection more than lived up to the designer's gold standard.</p></div>"
51,fall,2006,f2006,dsquared,"The red carpet set atop a grass runway said it all about Dean and Dan Caten's Dsquared² show: a camped-up collision of huntin' and shootin' clothes and hoity-toity formalwear. The cheerful play on gamekeeper checks, mackintoshes, and tartan that came at the beginning of their escapade produced some good shrunken jackets, vests, and plaid shirts, which were cleverly mated with tuxedos, bow ties, and jeans. But the momentum proved hard to maintain. After a Mountie trotted by in a teeny red puffer and jodhpurs, it fell to Angela Lindvall to keep a straight face while wearing a sporran on a Black Watch coat-dress.</p><p>By that point, the Catens were knee-deep into their country-house ballwear, and the joke was flagging. Most of their satin dresses and crystal-beaded knits looked like rehashes of things Dolce &amp; Gabbana did years ago. It was an odd detour, because what actually keeps audiences coming here is the spirited, sexy stuff the Dsquared² duo does with jeans and streetwear. Sure enough, denim did make an appearance in the form of cropped, vaguely jodhpur-ish pants. Good-looking though these were, they first appeared on their runway a few seasons ago, so there was a sense of waiting for the next installment. It never materialized. Could the Caten boys please put their heads together, quit fooling around so much, and get on with their next real surprise?</p></div>"
52,fall,2006,f2006,elie-saab,"Now in his second season at the Paris ready-to-wear, Elie Saab is starting to hit his stride. Fifteen looks shorter than his spring show, his fall presentation had a stronger focus. Inspired by imperial Russia, this white, black, and red collection not only echoed that of fellow couturier Valentino, but also touched on some of the trends of the season, including puffed sleeves, velvet, and embellished fur. With his most famous client, the sultry Halle Berry having graduated to Versace and its spring ad campaign, it seems Saab has moved on, too. One of the show's most charming looks, a white Empire gown with a black velvet belt, was sweet, as opposed to sexy, the sensibility for which he's long been known.</p><p>There was still room for improvement, however. Several of his gowns looked like they could have used a good steaming, and a few could have been shortened—that might've prevented the spill one model took in a ruffly black tulle number. And next season, Saab would be well advised to book bigger girls and invest more in beauty. Possibly someone told him that undone hair and makeup would make his clothes look more modern, but one glance at the polished coifs and faces in his front row and you know that undone is not what Saab's clients come to him for.</p></div>"
53,fall,2006,f2006,emanuel-ungaro,"After several seasons on the fashion critical-list, the sexy, drapey, polka-dotted legacy of Emanuel Ungaro is at last showing signs of a heartbeat, having been jump-started by new ownership, and fresh design leadership from the Norwegian-American Peter Dundas. The show held out hope that somebody young and hot might finally want to wrap herself in Ungaro, thanks to the collection of Parisian glam-rock chic that came down the red-lacquered runway.</p><p>Apparently, what was on display was the result of some emergency surgery: The 40-year-old Dundas only recently resigned from Roberto Cavalli. Still, his extensive experience—which includes postings at Gaultier and Lacroix—equipped him to create something new but recognizably Ungaro-ish out of the old house standards. He did a good job of referencing the leg-of-mutton-sleeve, tight-waist silhouette from the jacket-and-coat archive, and he even managed to blow the aura of staleness off the signature drapery, which last looked good in the eighties. Old-school onlookers might find fault, since some of this was achieved with wrapping and knotting, rather than fairy-fingered couture techniques. Yet it was precisely those draped dresses—some of which contrasted Ungaro's chiffon leopard prints and bold dots in scarflike hip-ties against plain covered-up tops—that made the look suddenly jump to modernity. However, the sexiest numbers by far were those realized entirely in slinky cashmere jersey, over turtlenecks—one a short silver-gray one-shouldered affair, and the other a stunning slim full-length lipstick-red gown with an erotically bound waist. It was quite enough to mark Dundas as a name to watch.</p></div>"
54,fall,2006,f2006,emilio-pucci,"There were some apparently conflicting conversations going on backstage before the Pucci show. In one corner Sienna Miller was enthusing about the Italian label's colorful history, ""I have a Pucci bikini I've lived in, lots of scarves, a dress that belonged to my mother."" And in another, her friend, the label's new designer Matthew Williamson, was saying, ""I looked at the archives and discovered there was a whole lot more to Pucci than prints. He also did little black dresses. I didn't want it to be predictable.""</p><p>Perhaps Williamson should sign Miller as a consultant, because, as she suggested, a girl looks to Pucci for a print—all the more if it's a revved up blast from that fabulous past. The fact that this is an idea still relevant to a 24-year-old It girl should have given Williamson the green light to work into ""the predictable."" Instead, he overthought the challenge of raiding the swirly-whirly archive and decided to do such things as, first, a black hooded wool coat banded with a little ethnic crewel work, and second—as he'd promised—a short black jersey dress with puffed sleeves. The print—a belted jersey top with matching leggings, borrowed from Emilio Pucci's stained-glass-window Cupola design of 1972—only came third in line.</p><p>Williamson did produce more of the pattern, recolored in gray, black, and pink, but he expended far more effort showing solid-color outfits like total-knit pantsuits with beanie hats and scarves, and fox-trimmed alpaca or brocade coats. Those ideas, as well as his flippy-hemmed dresses, vaguely tinged with Biba-era references, compounded the feeling that he'd landed these clothes wide of the essential mark of Pucci's luxe Italian heritage. Never mind. Next season, when he's had his chance to get his feet under the design table properly, he'll hopefully surrender to everything that's wonderful about a Pucci summer—psychedelic bikinis and all.</p></div>"
55,fall,2006,f2006,emma-cook,"Each season Emma Cook writes another episode in her familiar story, bending it a little toward her notion of fashion, but without breaking the thread. Her materials are handcrafted leather and print, and she has a girl named Susie in mind who likes leggy clothes that stay just this side of cute.</p><p>For fall, she put Susie in stiff leather coats and scallop-edged, A-line trapeze dresses with laser-cut, stained-glass Art Nouveau overlays, a motif repeated later on with gray jersey dresses. (Gray is big on the London palette this season.) Cook's marble-printed, long-sleeve shifts jibed with the trend toward covered-up day dresses. Meanwhile, her party frocks with shards of mirror embroidered onto champagne satin looked as if she might be steering Susie toward a West End cocktail for the first time. For a girl who works in the gritty East End, that's a step in a whole new direction.</p></div>"
56,fall,2006,f2006,emporio-armani,"Giorgio Armani has major ambitions for his Emporio empire. Talking backstage among racks of spotted dévoré velvet dresses, puff-shouldered leather jackets, taffeta bubble skirts, rabbit and fake-fur coats, and rows and rows of crocodile-stamped ballerina flats and platforms, he said his second line is going global; 13 new stores will open this year, with 19 more by the end of 2007.</p><p>To fuel that turbo-charged expansion, he's harnessed his young team of studio designers to take the collection—and the accessories—in a direction that is much more sharply in step with fashion. His opening look was a narrow laser-cut fake-fur coat over a knee-length skirt, silk blouse, and squared-off ballet flats with metal-tipped bows at the toe—the Emporio version of the bourgeois lady look, neatly nailed. Like Armani's main collection, Emporio avoided pants (if you overlook the odd pair of wide-leg taffeta knickers) in favor of a jacket-and-skirt or jacket-over-dress combination. The designer also reprised the forties silhouette in velvet polka dots as well as working up many variations of draped bubble skirts.</p><p>Armani tends to show so many outfits on the runway that the collection becomes difficult to digest. A better way to look at them is separately, on a rack, the way they'll be seen in a store. In that context, many of the elements—those tiny, curvy, battered-leather spencers, a rockin' zebra-print fake-fur jacket, the chunky-glam shoes, and his first great hat, a fox cossack with a black patent visor—qualify as pretty cool.</p></div>"
57,fall,2006,f2006,erdem,"Erdem Moralioglu is the half-Turkish, half-English, Canada-raised designer who won last year's British Fashion Fringe competition. As if that isn't complicated enough to remember, focus on the fact that after graduating from London's Royal College of Art, he worked for Diane von Furstenberg.</p><p>DVF, or at least her example, is what Moralioglu should be focusing on, too. His competition collection won on the strength of its soft printed dresses—not, in this case, wraps, but long, accordion-pleated floor-sweepers. That whimsical, romantic bent comes, he says, from a childhood spent watching Merchant Ivory films on PBS; and if he's going to make a mark, it will be as a dressmaker. Unfortunately, he obscured that underlying potential in his debut show by trying too hard to prove he can do tailoring, and by overworking a dandyish George Sand-meets-Napoleon theme. If he stops fretting about historical narrative and gives in to his soft side—the one that came up with a pretty cream silk dress and a striped floor-length gown with an antique lace ruff—it'll be easier to clarify what he has to offer.</p></div>"
58,fall,2006,f2006,etro,"This season, Veronica Etro looked at sixteenth-century art and textiles to give a flavor to a collection that always calls to women with an eye for rich mixes of pattern and a taste for nonaggressive, romantic clothes. Boho may be out of fashion for the moment, but she designed herself out of that dilemma by superimposing gemlike purples, dark greens, and golds on simplified shapes, instead of the flowy deluxe peasant look of presentations past. ""I was thinking of Elizabethan women, who had so much power,"" she said. ""I didn't want it to be so romantic, and the colors had to be less bright. But in the end, it has to be very feminine.""</p><p>Loose, long-sleeve, knee-length satin dresses, decorated at the neckline and cuffs with 3-D velvet ""stones"" or smatterings of metalwork studs, put the collection in line with the season's covered-up silhouettes and mood of restraint. The bags, inspired by treasure chests, came in carved and gilded leather or as patchworks of gold brocade and emerald and deep-purple velvet. Etro did well not to force her theme into costumey excess, though. Ultimately, the attraction of these clothes is that they make lovely and not blatantly identifiable pieces to slip into a wardrobe—the sort of things that force friends to close in, feel the fabric, and murmur, ""That's nice. Who's it by?""</p></div>"
59,fall,2006,f2006,fendi,"Karl Lagerfeld nailed a condensed synthesis of at least two crosscurrents at Fendi: short volumes à la the sixties, and militarism with a touch of the medieval. If that sounds awfully complicated on paper, the show's abbreviated gray flannel coats, rounded at the shoulder and cinched with cummerbunds, made it seem almost simple. He pulled things off by styling the show with black tights and astrahkan boots with huge folded-over cuffs, accessories that neatly knitted together such apparently diverse pieces as a starship-trooper-uniform coat and a cape-shoulder, sculpted-waist mink jacket.</p><p>A fashion historian nonpareil, Lagerfeld took bubbles as a theme and connected the dots between renaissance puffed sleeves, Fortuny puffballs, poufed Poiret-esque lines, and Cardin-like ovoid cabans. Still, the main action at Fendi is in the furs and bags, and among the former, there were some great pieces. A fierce, shaggy fox with huge shoulders made a big statement, as did a nipped-waist honey-and-gray mink with exaggerated braided sleeves and a curvy foulard collar. A slim white reversed fur coat with vertical seams in black was simpler, but no less memorable.</p><p>The house's new black and gold-trimmed bucket bags, meanwhile, were inspired by the Romanesque architecture of Ravenna. Silvia Venturini Fendi also stamped a rendition of the Fendi palazzo in Rome onto the big rectangular belt buckles that were an unmissable part of this strong collection. Unfortunately, however, the show may be equally remembered for the events preceding it. Part of the photographers' stand collapsed, causing several injuries that required medical attention—a sobering reminder to all present of how frequently audiences at tightly packed presentations are put in the way of serious accidents waiting to happen.</p></div>"
60,fall,2006,f2006,salvatore-ferragamo,"Taking on the eighties is a dangerous game. There are a rare few capable of making it so bad it's good, and then there are the others who get so bogged down in the bad it's awful. Unfortunately, Ferragamo was one of those collections that braved the decade—as well as a sortie into the tamer sixties, plus a few unrelated themes for good measure—in such a way that it landed in the second category.</p><p>An overlong presentation on a vast runway added to the problems of a collection that seemed to skip randomly through sweeping-collar coats and power-shoulder jackets, belted knit dresses, cowl-neck sweaters, shapeless cardigans, and bourgeois scarf prints—memories that, if they are to be retrieved at all, need real polish to look relevant, let alone attractive. Alongside those came the sixties baby dolls, chemise dresses, and duchesse satin bubbles, and one inexplicable spherical skirt in Mongolian lamb. A theme of accordion pleating produced one pretty petrol-blue three-quarter-sleeve dress, and there was a good shaggy purple fur jacket visible in the melee. But in total, this collection did nothing to either flatter the models—or to advance the image of the brand.</p></div>"
61,fall,2006,f2006,gareth-pugh,"Just when it seemed like the good old days of rebellious British eccentricity were over, along comes a pale youth, late of Central Saint Martins, who stages a fashion carnival for his first solo show. His name is Gareth Pugh, a lad from dour, post-industrial Sunderland, and he sent out a parade of perverse-looking harlequins with pom-pom hairdos, painted faces, and pointy hats. They wore vinyl bodysuits, towering platform Doc Martens, gargantuan ruffs, and voluminous checkered boleros and coats in black and gold. If the effect was a bit silly, there was also something defiantly ridiculous in devoting so much time and money to something so playful. To set the tone, he bounced a few giant black-and-white helium balloons into the audience before the show began. (Pugh has a thing about balloons.)</p><p>Though Pugh is the new sensation among the febrile design-student London clique, he's merely the latest addition to a long tradition of fashion-as-performance-art that stretches back through Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood to the eighties club culture of Leigh Bowery. That, of course, is ancient history to Pugh's generation, who grew up starved of fashion fun in the dour days of grunge and minimalism. It's no wonder that kids like him want to break out a bit now. As for grown-ups who might worry how he'll survive, well, there were precisely two coats—one with mink sleeves and a ruffled front, and another with hyperinflated lapels (that balloon influence again)—that might just keep the wolf from his door.</p></div>"
62,fall,2006,f2006,giambattista-valli,"The rest of fashion may be preoccupied with the cocoon and trapeze shapes he proposed in his breakout spring collection, but Giambattista Valli has moved on. Today he explored a cut he only touched upon last season: a mid-calf-length skirt of almost New Look proportions. Perhaps by way of contrast, he also introduced its diametric opposite, the hobble. In the former, models sashayed freely around a hall on the upper floor of the Musée de l'Homme, a venue boasting stunning views of the Eiffel Tower. In the latter, not the easiest style to strut a runway in, they had all the time in the world to admire the vista.</p><p>If wearabilty wasn't always foremost in Valli's mind, artistry was. Take one radzimir sheath, the face-framing ruffles of which trailed along a neckline that dipped to the lower back, suggesting angel's wings. Feathers were a recurring motif. They trimmed the thigh-high hem of a showgirl's orange sequined minidress, and more subtly, were layered from waist to hem on a slim skirt worn with a slouchy V-neck sweater.</p><p>Day-for-night dressing was another theme at play. What interests Valli, and what he excels at, is dressing a woman who never dresses down. After eight, it's gold bugle beads; before, it's a camel cashmere jacket with crystals the size of cell-phone screens glittering at her neck.</p></div>"
63,fall,2006,f2006,giles-deacon,"Finally Giles Deacon is living up to his hype. For fall, he whipped himself out of his complacent groove as a young London designer who reveres ""lady couture,"" and delivered something splashy, quirky, and colorfully original.</p><p>Part of the show's punch was in the bold stripes, dots, gigantic leopard spots, fluorescents, Lurex, patent leather, and holograms he used—in marked contrast to the somber wintry palettes that have been depressing the mood elsewhere. Another plus was in his silhouettes: fifties and sixties shifts and trapezes, hourglass eighties dresses, and—new to him—flowy poncho tops over easy pants. Deacon said he'd been inspired by the paintings of Ellsworth Kelly, as well as ""a healthy feeling that I wanted to throw everything out and look for contemporary modernism.""</p><p>But you don't need a fashion or art history degree to respond to Deacon. It hardly matters that he researched his patterns in the Tate in St. Ives, or that references to Cardin can be caught along the way. What does count is that the results—seamed and patched together into arty, optically vivid effects—don't look like any reverent rehash of the past. It's taken a few seasons to get there, but now that Deacon has found the nerve to say what he believes in, he's turning into something interesting.</p></div>"
64,fall,2006,f2006,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani—and not a pantsuit in sight? That was one surprise Armani delivered in a fall show that was consistently focused, not on the work options he nailed years ago, but on evening, in all of its guises. Operating on the understanding that real life isn't one long red carpet, and with the pragmatism Armani is famous for, the collection worked methodically through appropriate solutions for every tricky event on the calendar: after-work drinks, semiformal dinner, corporate entertaining, all the way up to the full-on flashbulb event.</p><p>Armani started by reworking his signature windowpane-check jacket into a short, nipped-waist shape worn with a gray satin skirt and high heels. That silhouette—covered but decorative on top with something slinkier going on below in the style of 1940's Hollywood—was played out in many ways, some more extreme than others. A few of the looks, with peaked shoulders and, say, a spotted emerald-and-purple dévoré draped skirt, paid a passing reference to the colorful side of eighties fashion from which Armani abstained during his power-suit years. A bedazzling satin and crystal-beaded nude number that nodded toward Bob Mackie was one more step into the unexpected.</p><p>Armani rounded off the collection with sparkle. There were many variations of the crystal-embroidered evening dresses that helped establish his pioneering relationship with Hollywood's A-list years ago. The show ended on home ground, then, but again there was the feeling that the designer has entered a more playful space. Perhaps this so-called somber personality is capable of teasing, too: Though many have complained about his egregious cocktail hats, he keeps showing them, regardless. He ended with a pink fluorescent sprout topping a fuchsia-toned crystal gown that could've only been a private laugh at his audience's expense.</p></div>"
65,fall,2006,f2006,givenchy,"A new season meant a new attitude at Givenchy. Designer Riccardo Tisci got an earful after his spring debut—and he seems to have taken the criticism on board. Gone was that show's hobbling silhouette, unfortunate footwear, and belabored theatrics. In their place was a collection that paid homage to the heritage of Hubert de Givenchy's house without being one-note. It had suits; it had, in red, the color of the moment; it had volume. Tisci even did sporty.</p><p>With the rest of the fashion world brooding over somber shades, protective layers, and austerity, you might've expected Tisci to work in that vein—after all, before he took over the reins at Givenchy, what little people knew of him was his way with a cardinal coat and his dark romanticism. Instead, he brought unexpected playfulness to tucked and folded army-green knits, shaggy chubbies, and shiny puffer jackets. And there were ready-for-the-retail-floor little black dresses by the dozen.</p><p>Tisci's first six models—all women of color—wore some of those cocktail numbers. There are some who might say that their place in the lineup—why not mix them in with the Russian-blonde brigade?—was a little forced. But it still drove home a point about the modeling business' lack of diversity, or worse, an industry-wide blind spot for anyone who doesn't fit a too-narrow definition of beauty. It's an issue few other designers have seemed willing to address recently. For that, and for a much improved sophomore effort, Tisci deserves kudos.</p></div>"
66,fall,2006,f2006,gucci,"Gold pantsuits, Ziggy eyes, ultraminis, and patchwork purple crocodile biker jackets: Yes, Frida Giannini is doing glam rock for fall. ""I was thinking of David Bowie and the way people played with their image to be something different every time they went out in the seventies,"" she said. ""It's less romantic and more about energy and showing off.""</p><p>That, of course, puts Gucci out on its own, given the sobriety- and restraint-obsessed mood of Milan, but you can see Giannini's thinking. Monasticism and abstract experimentalism would be nonsense on a Gucci runway. Its meaning in the world is as a nonintellectual, good-time brand, and in any case, when all around is going gray, there's always a need for a bit of flash.</p><p>Giannini's take on the label's recent heritage wasn't quite Tom Ford's all-out orgy of glamour. But she did slip in some knowingly high-nineties accessories: metal bags chained to a fetishy cuff, and a pair of high-shine cranberry platforms in the same techno ""car paint"" finish Ford used in his first collection a decade ago. As for the clothes, some of her ultrashort metallic jersey dresses actually read as more sub-Versace (which is a reference many young designers are enthusiastic about now), though she also tempered things with maxi, printed, and sequined options for the slightly more modest nightclubber. Even at their least wild, though, these looks weren't designed to be seen during daylight hours. It would be interesting to see Giannini take the collection beyond evening next time.</p></div>"
67,fall,2006,f2006,hermes,"Jean Paul Gaultier wasn't the first designer this week to catch the fencing bug: Viktor &amp; Rolf put their models in pearl and rattan mesh masks. But Gaultier took it further at Hermès, sending a few of his polished gals out with honest-to-goodness three-foot foils. Sure, they were a little gimmicky—as were the riding crops which appeared later—but they sharpened the show's sporty themes, reinforced throughout by pants tucked into glossy leather boots. And you couldn't begrudge Gaultier his props, because everything from an on-trend long black leather cape (which appeared twice) to a timeless checkered pantsuit was beautifully made and effortlessly chic.</p><p>If Gaultier's signature collection was showy, Hermès was quieter. Fine-gauge knits, woolen pencil skirts, streamlined trenches, and cropped shearlings and furs came without the ornamentation they were treated to elsewhere this season. In contrast, an interlude of silk Jacquard in silvery-gray or bordeaux that featured matched fencers was busier: while it displayed Gaultier's ready humor, it didn't have the same anonymous sophistication as the rest of the proceedings. Mostly, the designer stuck to a black, brown, and ivory palette, the better to showcase the multitude of mega-luxe bags. Using the brand logo on his clothes has been a temptation for Gaultier in seasons past, but today he resisted, and in the process put himself in a position to make new fans among women for whom elegance trumps labels.</p></div>"
68,fall,2006,f2006,j-mendel,"It's hard to believe that fur specialist Gilles Mendel added ready-to-wear to his repertoire a mere two years ago; his evening gowns have already become popular red carpet garb for stars and socialites. The latter were out in force for what ended up being a safe fall show. It opened with tailored separates that were punctuated with hints of flash emanating from metallic tweeds and from rhinestone buttons on cuffs. Fur-wise, there was a burgundy broadtail coat with fox trim at its curved seams that echoed the bubble shapes seen elsewhere this season, and a white mink that was worked in an Art Deco motif—all of which was nice, though not necessarily fresh. What did look new were the jaunty Persian lamb skullcaps, and a quirky brown-and-black leather jacquard coat. Perhaps wisely, the coat was one of the few direct references to the show's nominal theme: Faye Dunaway in <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em>.</p><p>Mendel's attempts to add fur to evening dresses seemed superfluous (why not just throw one of his coats over your shoulders?), and it resulted in a heavy-hemmed look that seemed anachronistic next to the wrap gowns in red and brown with sweet black bows at the shoulders, or the floaty tiered numbers with a hint of sparkle at the neckline. Mendel certainly knows how to romance a gown, but rather than rely too much on that one formula for success, he'd be wise to push his clothes—especially his furs—forward.</p></div>"
69,fall,2006,f2006,jasmin-shokrian,"Eadweard Muybridge's plates of birds in flight were the lofty starting point for Jasmin Shokrian's second New York outing. And while the references were hardly literal—there were thankfully no feathers trailing from her unfinished edges—they did leave one editor cracking wise, something about Edith Head's Hitchcock suits after ""the birds"" had gotten to them.</p><p>To be fair, Shokrian's asymmetrically drapey sheaths, cocooning jackets, and hobble skirts with tucked hems played squarely into fashion's current fascination with volume, and were only a shade more deconstructed than her well-received debut of a year ago. But layered as they were with what she referred to in her program notes as capelets and collars (dickeys, essentially), they came off as just too tricky.</p><p>That's not to say there weren't some high-concept standouts. A circular cardigan in wool jersey called upon Shokrian's sculptural talents. And her fabrics looked rich, especially a charcoal silk crepe folded and pleated into a knee-length dress that was memorable for its relative simplicity.</p></div>"
70,fall,2006,f2006,jean-paul-gaultier,"""If I want animals, I can go to the Bronx Zoo,"" one editor wisecracked as she left Jean Paul Gaultier's beautiful but awkwardly choreographed fall show. To accompany his models, the designer sent out everything from a bald cat to a dreadlocked sheepdog to a greyhound that tried to remove a plastic cone collar as it made its reluctant path down the runway (the girl who wore a matching one of her own didn't look very happy, either). Gaultier could have skipped the pet tricks, because these clothes spoke for themselves. One model came out with an owl perched on her wrist, but what was worth noting was the lovely gold embroidery on her velvet top, as well as the gloves made from tiny half-circles of iridescent leather that evoked python skin.</p><p>Gaultier played with such touchstones of the moment as fur, dresses over pants, length, and volume. Tucked-hem bubble dresses were teamed with smartly tailored jackets or topped flaring trousers; trapeze coats came in sheared fur or were edged in velvet; and a sparkly evening column was veiled with tulle. In a season of memorable trench coats, Gaultier's were standouts. Some were accessorized with stiff crocodile girdles that, depending on your point of view, smacked of subordination or, more in keeping with the current mood, domination. A few others were straightforward above the waist, flaring out below into flippy, flirty kilts. But the best was Stella Tennant's classic crinkled-silk number—it made you forget the four-legged distractions.</p></div>"
71,fall,2006,f2006,jenni-kayne,"At Jenni Kayne's last L.A. show, Jared Leto and both Wilson brothers sat in the front row. Fast-forward a year and a half to her sophomore New York fashion week effort, and the eye candy was confined to model Jessica Stam and a pair of Hearst sisters—a lovely enough sight, though not on the level of that Left Coast trio. But what Kayne has lost in celebrity sparkle by bringing her collection east, she has gained in editorial attention. Backstage before her presentation, the 23-year-old Angeleno appeared happy, if a little nervous about the tradeoff. ""I want to do this like a real New Yorker,"" she said, alluding to her new focus on outerwear but also implicitly acknowledging the increased spotlight.</p><p>How did she fare? Well, that outerwear stood up. A navy leather trench and a brown leather bolero with short sleeves looked great, and should the gods of global warming allow the temperature to dip below freezing next winter, her woolen coats with mink collars (these much more uptown in feeling) will keep the chill out. A fox vest, with the laid-back seventies vibe she worked for spring, was equally luxe. If her collection lacked focus, especially the suiting, which veered from a sleek update of YSL's smoking to flaring gauchos, blame it on growing pains. That, and perhaps listening to too many voices other than her own. Her dresses, on the other hand, were on message. They appeared in miniature prints for day and beads for night, and were belted in a way that these days spells cool everywhere.</p></div>"
72,fall,2006,f2006,jil-sander,"Perhaps it takes one northern soul to understand another. In Raf Simons, a young Belgian man, it looks as if the Germanic purity of Jil Sander's womanly aesthetic has finally—after many painful seasons—found a worthy successor. Pantsuits, white shirts, scrubbed faces, clean hair: This was a back-to-basics show, but its attenuated lines gave the collection a confident shape. Backstage, Simons said shouldering the responsibility for continuity ""feels good. This is an intimate company. It's all here, so I didn't have to worry about anything except concentrating on the outline.""</p><p>This house, of course, is founded on jackets and trousers, both of which Simons upheld to the letter. Boxy jackets cut from volume-retaining fabric came balanced over arrow-narrow, boy-tailored pants and high, wedge-heel boots. With those exaggerated lines he redrew the template upon which he superimposed refinements on Sander standards: short pea coats with sharply delineated volumes, two-button jackets, fly-front coats studded with a single top button, padded shapes in luxe techno fabric. They all walked by, in multiple fabric variations and colors from dark brown to inky black to ecru—a tad too many, in fact, to make the point.</p><p>Just in time, Simons veered away from all that monasticism with black buttoned-up shirtdresses and loose, artily pleated shifts familiar to Sander fans. Where he made his own imprint was in a series of sinuously flowing floor-length dresses. Long-sleeve, and plain or simply knotted in front, they turned to reveal bare skin, and a tender gathering of folds drawn into the small of the back. Minimal, respectful, and highly erotic, they were a signal, perhaps, of something unusual Simons can bring to fashion: the touch of a heterosexual man.</p></div>"
73,fall,2006,f2006,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart's fall collection marked a change in direction, with some looks suggesting a new horizon, and a few others pointing toward a dead end. From the cossack-collared trapeze coat that opened the show—and the black-clad rocker girls who followed—there was an air of London cool that swept down the runway, erasing any thought of Stuart's usual sugary, ornamental fare. Instead the emphasis was on long and lean: great coats and sweeping skirts slit up the front and worn with blouson-sleeve blouses for an equestrienne-meets-goth vibe, and skinny black jeans, beaded vests, and a mouse-print minidress that seemed to be cut with the young and slender in mind.</p><p>Stuart was trying to push the envelope, but she still wants to cater to a wide audience; for every downtown look—such as the Dior-esque black-and-silver-striped minidress with matching scarf—there was something safer, like the bare-backed jersey gowns which were vying for a spot on the charity gala circuit.</p><p>The designer mostly achieved her aim of making this collection ""cleaned up and modern,"" but with a show comprising 50 looks, there was certainly room to edit: There were too many Empire and thirties-inspired dresses, and some of them just looked like vintage redone. Yes, there was a sense that Stuart is more clued in to how young women dress today, but the designer hasn't entirely abandoned the past.</p></div>"
74,fall,2006,f2006,john-galliano,"To get to John Galliano's fall show, guests had to drag themselves to a bleak industrial studio on the outskirts of Paris on a freezing and traffic-clogged Saturday night. But if anyone was expecting one of the designer's extravagant fashion performances as compensation for the trek, it didn't materialize. Instead, Galliano offered what was, for him, a minor-key piece about a tattered army of Confederates.</p><p>The show opened, rather confusingly, with some long black bulky coats that looked like near counterparts to the ones he had shown earlier in the week at Dior, though a touch rougher and more rustic in the execution. As it went on, the differences emerged more, as frayed fragments of the American flag got patched into skirts and jackets, and plaid work-shirting appeared shaded into the tips of garments. More than the clothes, it was the music—stirring country-music ballads of war and personal loss sung by Emmylou Harris, Joan Baez, and Dolly Parton—that transmitted the feeling that Galliano was fingering: aspects of patriotism and working-class American roots, as well as hints of its current psychological state. It added a timely footnote to the march of militarism that has risen elsewhere this season, and there was a certain poignance to his faded and homespun paisely patchwork-printed prairie dresses and makeshift coats and hats apparently hewn out of Victorian rugs. But though they fit nicely enough into his narrative, they lacked some of the creative intensity that Galliano usually brings. Unlike his wilder outings, this didn't feel like a collection in which he had taken on a personal battle to push fashion forward.</p></div>"
75,fall,2006,f2006,jonathan-saunders,"Jonathan Saunders did a couple of very smart things while he was designing his fall collection. One, he took pattern-cutting lessons; and two, he toured the States, where he learned about American customers from retailers. Before he even settled on a concept—which was influenced by Peggy Guggenheim's 1940's art collection—that back-study gave him the technical and mental advantages to make a breakthrough with this line.</p><p>A prodigiously talented print designer with a fine-art background, Saunders has developed an increasingly sophisticated handwriting. He engineers pattern and shading—in this collection, graphic lines, blocks, and schematic feather prints—to edge hems and the tips of scarves, and to lend trompe l'oeil effects to fluttering panels that seem to merge into the body of dresses. The show's black, white, and gray scheme was inspired by an odd collision of modernism and surrealism (and particularly by Elsa Schiaparelli's famous Tear dress), but that's not what really matters. Saunders can now cut a dress that not only shows off his prints, but also looks great on a body. More than that, his long evening dresses have a new raison d'être as eventwear for American women who like to feel pretty, but with an edge.</p></div>"
76,fall,2006,f2006,junya-watanabe,"An electrical snafu postponed the start of Junya Watanabe's show long enough for the Sex Pistols' anthem ""Anarchy in the UK"" to play three times on a backstage sound system. Sitting in the dark, one editor wondered out loud if the delay were intentional—a valid question given this Japanese designer's appetite for subversion. Just then, a minuet kicked in and Watanabe's model troops stormed the runway in unison wearing army green, as if to say, ""There's a war on, people. Have you forgotten?""</p><p>Last season's spiky paper headgear had been transformed into ominous masks. Made from electrical tape, tufts of black hair, and spiky silver studs, they looked every bit as disturbing as the similar hoods on his countryman Jun Takahashi's runway earlier in the week. The long dresses Watanabe constructed from patchworks of concert T-shirts for spring reappeared, but this time they were pieced together from fatigues, camouflage material, and green lace. Continuing the military theme, he took a battalion's worth of army jackets and worked them up into the trenches, parkas, and tail coats trailing straps that he's know for. And for an added dose of symbolism, he crocheted red, white, and blue into his camo sweaters.</p><p>The great thing about Watanabe, though, is that you never sense he's being provocative just for the sake of it. It was a thrill to watch him refine his timely ideas, and make exciting and, yes, wearable clothes in the process. Especially when many others, as they return to and rework the highlights of mid-century design, are resisting just that: timeliness.</p></div>"
77,fall,2006,f2006,kai-kuhne,"Kai Kühne's sophomore show offered him the chance to really define his voice, now that the As Four histrionics have abated. He went about it by concentrating on shape and volume, though without forsaking his signature eccentricities. Lantern and bell sleeves, poufs and tulip skirts bloomed throughout the collection, but he showed them on the awkward stems of bow-tied fetish shoes and against an aural backdrop of German heavy metal.</p><p>The strengths of this collection were those of his spring presentation: Kühne has a way with a cape-sleeve jacket (rendered for fall in a luxe black angora-cashmere blend), as well as with shirtdresses and jumpsuits. The quality of the craftsmanship was clear throughout, but Kühne, ever exuberant, said that he ""wanted life in the construction."" This translated, at times, into pieces that were overwrought, like a full bell sleeve accented with accordion pleats. He also showed rather too many variations on the pouf theme.</p><p>The most charming version was a soft, floral chiffon with a subtle balloon hem and a sash. A black taffeta tulip dress with an asymmetrical chiffon drape also stood out, and a scene-stealer, in terms of line, was an ensemble of high-waist black pants topped with an off-the-shoulder brown raffia top. Less successful were the shorts and some stiff, gawky blouses. Kühne claims that his designs are driven by his feelings, and this collection found the designer in an expansive mood of creativity. As for his voice? Well, he's still discovering his range.</p></div>"
78,fall,2006,f2006,karl-lagerfeld,"""I like to reinvent myself, it's part of the job,"" said Karl Lagerfeld a few hours before his first-ever New York show for the Lagerfeld Collection and Karl Lagerfeld labels. And we like to watch. Despite the late hour on the last night of fashion week, a high-powered crowd of editors, retailers, stylists, and photographers turned up at a Chelsea ballet studio to see what the business' busiest impresario would do next.</p><p>In his program notes, he promised ""tailoring, sculpting, shape-making, and mixing proportions with different influences and moods."" Toss in layering, and the description fits. You could argue that there was too much of too much to take it all in—one editor observed how refreshing it would've been to see the female models in the men's more-simply-cut-and-presented evening suits. But several items did stand out, a few for the wrong reasons (no one but a model can pull off that bunching of fabric at the bust and hips), and a few for the right—including a brown wool trench silk-screened with an abstract camouflage print.</p><p>Besides cool slouchy leather boots and not-ready-for-mainstream fur cuffs, there were precious few extras. Here's to hoping that next season Lagerfeld invents some of his signature irresistible accessories for these new collections.</p></div>"
79,fall,2006,f2006,kenneth-cole-new-york,"More industry spoof than social commentary, the video Kenneth Cole screened before his Friday morning show addressed such mock-serious issues as the dangers of air kissing, the overuse of the fashion business' favorite colloquialism, ""fabulous,"" and obsessive catwalking. It got some giggles, thanks in part to the archly somber soundtrack, but in the end, we'd have to say that as a comedian, Cole makes a great fund-raiser. (He was one of several designers who played a major part in last fall's Seventh on Sale AIDS charity event.)</p><p>Once the show proper got underway, though, Cole mostly stuck to what he does best: translating the prevailing moods for the aspirational masses. For fall, that means a slim silhouette of cropped jackets topping tweedy pencil skirts or lean double-breasted blazers and safari jackets over high-waist trousers. The most desirable sweater was a belted cable-knit cardigan. Suit-dressing may have been embraced by the fashion-forward crowd, but Cole's customers still love a dress, and this season, like last, he whipped up a group of blousy silk chiffon numbers. Despite their Crayola colors, they will be easier to wear than the models-only, drapey silk jersey styles in shades of gray that closed the show. More forgiving were a pair of sashed velvet wrap dresses. The latter came in a peat green that matched one of the collection's highlights, a full-skirt trench that would be a bargain at any price.</p></div>"
80,fall,2006,f2006,kenzo,"Taking Puccini¿s <em>Turandot</em> as inspiration, Kenzo¿s Antonio Marras sent out a fanciful collection of fall clothes that taken one by one had an insouciant charm. But shown at great length and often layered, as they were, the effect became treacly. In that famous opera, the protagonist is a Chinese princess who thinks nothing of ordering the death of a suitor who can't solve her riddles; Marras could have used some of that ruthlessness when it came to editing his show.</p><p>Pinafore dresses in embroidered silk, mohair knits of roses and peonies, wrap coats and frogging details seemed in keeping with the theme. Even a camouflage vest backed in hot pink could be said to reflect the wild side of Marras¿ muse. There was less explanation, though, for a double-layer pleated tartan skirt, or a plaid coat-dress.</p><p>For the finale, a giant lantern at the back of the runway lit up and slid open to reveal the models arrayed on steps behind a blooming cherry tree. As they took one last lap, thousands of tiny petals exploded from overhead confetti machines—thank you, LVMH. Here at least, Marras stayed true to his operatic inspiration.</p></div>"
81,fall,2006,f2006,lacoste,"The invitation was a (blank) cassette tape, De La Soul's <em>3 Feet High and Rising</em> was the show's featured track, and the models emerged from a giant lit-up boom box. For Lacoste's fall runway presentation, creative director Christophe Lemaire was intent on showing a more ""urban, street"" side to the iconic preppy label. At times, his take on the hip-hop theme was too literal—the retro-looking zip-up tracksuits and styling touches emulated the trendsetters in Jamel Shabazz's book <em>Back in the Days</em> without adding anything fresh—but Lemaire also offered his share of covetable separates.</p><p>There were multiple variations of the miniskirt for women, or most likely girls, some with rip-trim hems, others in corduroy. That might not make for fashion news, but the jackets did, especially those in white shearling. Sporty hooded numbers—some with a swing cut, others with a drawstring at the waist—came across as fresh takes on classics. The famous polos, some striped, others in unexpected colors, were highlighted in the second section of the show, where they were styled in fashionable layers. Padded moon boots—which resembled puffer-topped Wellies—looked like a must-have accessory for fall, and the patent sneakers for men will take guys effortlessly from street to club.</p></div>"
82,fall,2006,f2006,lanvin,"Last time around, Alber Elbaz's fierce, streamlined, high-platformed collection raced ahead of the season, igniting a lady-versus-power-woman debate that has only just burst into flame on other runways. For fall, Elbaz turned away from that thought to engage in a less obviously agenda-setting round of small talk: the conversation about the legacies of midcentury haute couture houses that is currently mesmerizing many Parisian designers.</p><p>Thus, the collection picked up Christian Dior's New Look (hip-padding), Cristobal Balenciaga's volumes (flounced tent dresses and swing-back coats), Elsa Schiaparelli's surrealism (illusion effects), and Saint Laurent's pantsuits (tuxedo dressing). That set Elbaz up for a challenge: how to modernize those shapes, and how to meld them into the empathetic, wardrobe-building style that has been his personal gift to the modern Lanvin woman.</p><p>When he concentrated on easy-to-wear party dresses, Elbaz was on home territory. His ballerina-like numbers of draped tulle on nude backgrounds, a black silhouette with an inverted triangle for a top and a full skirt below, and slim black dresses with bright satin folds inserted into the front were all in that lovely vein. Elbaz's inventive jewelry—big neckpieces made from crystal and gem-set teardrops of jersey—also put him in a category of his own.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""54y6dm""></div></div><p>Elsewhere, though, the designer's more-intellectual experiments with form could end up leading him into an uncharacteristic collision with women's sensitivities. Those who dress to avoid broadness of beam and kindly inquiries of ""When's it due?"" may not leap to invest in molded, stand-out hips or dresses that swing (out, and out again) from the shoulder. Still, this collection held out a lot that was less assertively ""fashion""-conscious—like the smoking looks and some great coats. These constitute the kind of personal, under-the-radar chic that makes women rave about Elbaz, even when he's not in ground-breaking mode.</p></div>"
83,fall,2006,f2006,louis-vuitton,"The only designer who makes a major impact on both the New York and Paris runways, Marc Jacobs had the first and last say on the season with a collection that translated his look from Manhattan-American into Louis Vuitton French. Jacobs¿ influential layered urchin look, done up in the drab colors of putty, gray and concrete, turned a little more streamlined and perky to rhyme with the ever-cute <em>jeune</em> sensibility which he knows keeps the LV tills ringing across the world.</p><p>Not to say that Jacobs deleted the eccentricity; if she wants, the Vuitton girl can jam on a completely mad flannel hat shaped like a flat upturned bowl, then sally out insouciantly to <em>épater les grown-ups</em> in scary black patent calf-length Velcro-strapped platform boots. (Note: Scary is good in this season of bold-stomping footwear extremes.) Between head and foot, though, the essential clothes story, as Jacobs put it, was about chopping ""all the influences of the past"" into some kind of modern Parisian fashion tartare.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>Mostly, the layerings of thick waffle-knit sweater dresses over pants, flannel bustiers over knits, and oddly folded and pulled tailoring ended up looking never-before-seen. But those past influences were traceable, too. Jacobs' LV team is full of fashion brainiacs who, among other things, can draw a parallel between a punky red leopard spot by Stephen Sprouse for Vuitton in 2003, and the animal prints of Saint Laurent. Other nods in the haute direction could be seen in the wide velvet Schiaparelli-shocking-pink pants and Dior-referenced gray skirt-suits and peplums. Even the huge fur-trimmed parka hoods that looked like mini army igloos (call them the last word in weird nowness) were part-inspired by the shape of the knitted cocoon that YSL made in the mid-sixties.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""7ukng8""></div></div><p>Still, what really matters to this house is the bags. This season's offerings were also a bit transgressive, though playfully so. Some of them came in soft embossed vinyl (a daring departure for a leather-goods house), others in white fur, sprayed with the multicolored blowups of the monogram as famously reinvented by Takahashi Murakami. Still others came in slinky leopard-printed chain mail grafted onto classic LV-stamped leather. The standout: a big patent hand-held tote with a handle formed from a pair of golden headphones. Never mind the clothes, that's the one they'll be beating down the Louis Vuitton doors for the minute the first delivery drops.</p></div>"
84,fall,2006,f2006,luca-luca,"With his smaller-scale show, Luca Orlandi proved that bigger isn't always better. He gave up his usual Sunday night slot in the tent for a 1 o'clock show in the brighter, more intimate, promenade. Why the change? ""I wanted less of a party atmosphere, less 'cha, cha, cha,' and more of an emphasis on the clothes,"" he said. Still, it wouldn't be a Luca Luca show without a front row that inspires a paparazzi frenzy; so Orlandi's audience included Nicky Hilton, Serena Williams, and Rachel Roy—not to mention Miss USA and Miss Universe, both wearing their sashes. The difference was that this time, unlike in seasons past, the festivities did not prevent a punctual start.</p><p>There was a change on the runway, too. Orlandi likes to do sexy, but this time, the allure was more subtle, more likely to be found in the tight fit of a simple sheath—in gray wool or even a tiger-pattern brocade—than in a plunging neckline. Orlandi said that he wanted to interpret classic American sportswear using the finest European fabrics, and he had some success, but the concept wasn't always a good fit for the Italian designer. A lone polo shirt, for example, looked gratuitous, and you don't need a show for the plainest of tops and skirts, whatever the material. But Orlandi was on form with his dresses, many of which featured intricate and effective smocking details, and the black macramé gown that closed the show was lovely.</p></div>"
85,fall,2006,f2006,luella,"In the TV commercials for her Target line that's selling like hotcakes across the United States, Luella Bartley touts British Invasion bands as influences. But for her fall signature collection, she riffed on American rockabilly acts like Carl Perkins by way of the Clash. That meant cardigans paired with skinny jeans, plaid bustier dresses with big sashes at the waist, and motorcycle jackets topping full-skirt minis, along with a dandy's drawer worth of bow ties.</p><p>This territory is a well-worked one in fashion, but Bartley managed to shake up the mix with a few ladylike Chanel-isms. It seems her CBGB girl wants to spend some quality time at Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle, hence the pearls worn in triple strands around the neck, the boxy black jackets, and quilted bags. These last were punked, of course, with charms like guns, bolts, and records. Lampshade dresses, though in tune with the pumped-up volumes of the past couple of seasons, looked a little Grand Ole Opry. But a short plaid trench worn with pin-straight cords will jibe with girls no matter what's on their iPods.</p></div>"
86,fall,2006,f2006,maison-martin-margiela,"It's quite amazing how two singular—not to mention reclusive—designers, in two different cities, managed to hit on the same idea in the same season. But that is exactly what transpired when Martin Margiela put on a show of clothes derived from home furnishings—an almost identical source to the one used by Hussein Chalayan. Not that their clothes look remotely similar—give or take a coincidental couch reference or two. What Margiela's been up to comes completely out of his own brand of what can only be called surrealist-utilitarianism: He studies found objects around him and thinks, “Aha! How can that be made into clothes?”</p><p>This season, it was the cretonne slipcovers of sofas, seventies leather chairs, pieces of rug, curtains, and car seats (complete with seat belts) that were transformed into jackets, trousers, skirts, high-heeled sandals, and belts. Just enough of the impression of the original materials is preserved in the clothes—such as the piping of the loose seat covers or a line of upholstery studs—to make their provenance readable. But while it's true that the sight of Margiela's ingenious transformations tickles his fans no end, they also show up to check out the non-jokey things they'll be putting on their shopping lists for the coming season. There was plenty on that score here; not just Margiela's immaculately tailored classic pinstripe pantsuit, but also some ultra-glam surprises, like a black feather coat and a diamante bow traced into a suede cutout neckpiece. For those who value unidentifiable, elegant dressing, Margiela's the man.</p></div>"
87,fall,2006,f2006,malo,"The not-so-secret motivation behind Malo's runway show was brand-building. The 34-year-old cashmere company wants to expand in America, and it hopes that the appointment of Fabio Piras—a Swiss graduate of Central Saint Martins with experience at Balmain Couture, Tod's, and most recently, Brioni—will achieve that goal, while putting Malo on the radar of the fashion cognoscenti.</p><p>Malo is known, of course, for luxury with a ""made in Italy"" touch. Piras delivered that in the company's signature cashmere knits, worked into a chunky but chic turtleneck dress and a number of delicate lacy numbers. There were also classic coats, notably a camel trapeze number and some substantial woven models. The ""moneyed"" point was really driven home by the furs, including a poncho and a white sheared-mink trench, as well as by the ultraluxe crocodile that was used for accessories. The peep-toe shoes were so high that they hobbled the models, but the thigh-high boots in green crocodile were fierce (as the price tag will surely be).</p><p>Those boots were a nod to the fashion-forward consumer, but ultimately Piras aimed this collection at the ""groomed lady"" he believes to be the brand's core customer. The intention was to communicate what Anna Piaggi's program notes termed ""a sensual hint of bon ton,"" and that was mostly achieved.</p></div>"
88,fall,2006,f2006,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"In a season when so many other New York designers are referencing the eighties, Marc Jacobs is kissing the decade goodbye. You could say his fall Marc by Marc Jacobs line evoked the nineties, with those raver's pants, slip dresses worn over long-sleeve tees, and the occasional baby-doll. But you'd be missing the point. Rather than depending on nostalgia for a particular era or influence to anchor his designs (which he's been wont to do in the past), Jacobs, of late, has been using each show to further refine his own unique vocabulary.</p><p>The proportion-play that he began exploring a year ago in his signature collection was there today in extra-wide pants, voluminous floor-sweeping skirts, and coats that seemed to float a few inches off the models' frames. There was some of the gloom, too. The palette was predominantly black, navy, and gray, with flashes of red here (on an armband) and there (the hem of a dress). From spring, Jacobs borrowed schoolgirls' coats and shifts. Finally, boys' vests and shrunken blazers added a sexy bit of androgyny to the mix. Piece by piece, it's bound to do gangbusters in his stores. More than one editor we know has already got her eye on those patent-leather platforms.</p></div>"
89,fall,2006,f2006,marc-jacobs,"You know this much about Marc Jacobs: You never know what he'll do next. Replacing the Nittany Lions marching band and his spring parade of high-school good girls gone bad were Philip Glass' symphony <em>Heroes</em> and a troupe of vagabonds in muted layers of plaid flannel, oversize knits, skirts worn atop pants, legwarmers, and tams whose cumulative effect was paradoxically chic.</p><p>When pressed for details backstage, Jacobs was vague. ""It's about the places I've been, the people I know, world leaders, and winter,"" he said. The one word he didn't use, though it was uttered by many in the audience, was grunge. Was this a reprise of the seminal collection that lost him his job at Perry Ellis back in 1992? Jacobs wasn't saying. But you saw elements of it in the flannel that was repurposed as strapless dresses, the sweaters that dragged along the knees, and the pants that were so puffy they looked as though they required their own hand pump. (Somewhere, Kal Ruttenstein, the man who famously championed that controversial collection and to whom Jacobs dedicated this show, was smiling.) Come evening, the designer's gorgeous urchins wore black net and metallic sequin dresses distressed to the point of tatters. In the midst of all this were eminently functional, not to mention desirable, coats, capes, shawls, and jackets. And, of course, superluxe bags; this wouldn't be a Jacobs runway without them.</p><p>Jacobs is making a habit of 180-degree reversals—gloomy one season, polished and upbeat the next, and now, for fall, disheveled once again. It's remarkable how a man who claimed post-show that he ""didn't know what to do"" can be full of such captivating ideas.</p></div>"
90,fall,2006,f2006,marios-schwab,"You have to look carefully to find London's twenty-first century talents. Like Marios Schwab, they're emerging slowly and deliberately from behind the scenes, learning from (or perhaps rebelling against) the mistakes made by their loudmouth nineties forebears. Schwab, though, has just as strong a vision—curvaceously body-seamed cuts, gorgeous fabrics, and meticulously beautiful finishes—as anyone who rocked London with their theatrical antics a decade ago.</p><p>Right now, young London stylists and editors are buzzing about the short sexy dresses of Versace and Alaïa. Schwab, a Greek/Austrian designer, is one of the few capable of rechanneling that enthusiasm into clothes that don't look embarrassingly retro. His short hourglass dresses in double-knit jersey, silk velvet, or gold and black brocade, come embellished with fronds of gold metalwork that curve around the bust. Other looks bespeak a fascination with the techniques of old-fashioned corsetry: A high-waisted skirt has a girdle panel in the front, and a seemingly stark little black dress turns to reveal a curvy bustle and erotic insets of lace in the small of the back. Schwab is humble—and sensible—enough to participate in a joint show organized by Fashion East, this time in the civilized surroundings of Terence Conran's Bluebird restaurant in Kings Road. Next season he should fly solo.</p></div>"
91,fall,2006,f2006,marni,"It's not easy to take those current buzzwords—""restraint,"" ""sobriety,"" and ""volume""—and interpret them in an understandable, attractive way. At Marni, however, Consuelo Castiglioni had it all worked out. From her first outfit—a straight-from-the-shoulder tunic over a narrow skirt sharpened with white gauntlets—she presented a collection that took on plainness and ease in a way that was positively chic.</p><p>The success of Marni's new minimalism came from the clever way Castiglioni treated offbeat combinations of fabric, texture, and color. She did slouchy, low-crotch menswear pants, and brought lightness and movement to a structured gray double-knit jersey top by patchworking it to chiffon in the back. She also made sense of graphic cap-sleeve dresses, balloon sleeves, and her signature edge-to-edge over-belted coats by showing them with gray ribbed tights and great three-quarter-length quirky boots, which came with a tiny slice taken out of the toe.</p><p>The collection made potentially somber tones of gray vibrate beautifully together, offset against navy, burgundy, and pale, plastery shades of pink and ecru. Marni's gentle rigor carried through to long, slim jersey evening dresses, high-belted in contrasting slivers of patent. These marked a bold step away from the loosely assembled, flower-print, hippie-dippy beginnings of the label, but the measure of its success lies in the fact that Castiglioni has moved forward in a way that seems less like a big departure than a natural progression along her own arty road.</p></div>"
92,fall,2006,f2006,martin-grant,"Martin Grant's exquisitely tailored clothes have a quiet glamour that's best appreciated up close. No doubt that's why he chose to show his fall collection in the intimate surroundings of the Galerie St. Pere on the Left Bank. The crush of admirers—and this Australian designer has many—made for challenging viewing conditions, but in the end, it was worth the inconvenience.</p><p>Grant said he was inspired by the sixteenth-century Flemish painter Corneille de Lyon, and as it turns out, that obscure historical reference produced some very current shapes and cuts. The jackets of his silk faille skirt suits, for starters, had this season's teardrop sleeves and tulip lapels, the latter of which he stuffed with tulle (a couturier's trick) for added drama and volume. A black waterproof trench arced out in back, while other coats were trimmed with passementerie and small pom-poms that followed the lines of boleros. That motif continued for evening with a jet-beaded fitted vest that topped a silk ottoman strapless gown. How another after-dark look—a strapless one-piece pantsuit in ivory tweed—relates to the sixteenth century is anybody's guess, but that was an easily overlooked misstep in an otherwise refined fall show.</p></div>"
93,fall,2006,f2006,matthew-williamson,"British fashion darling Matthew Williamson, known for his color sense and use of prints, was recently tapped by LVMH to take over the design reins at Emilio Pucci. Perhaps to differentiate his namesake collection from the surely print-heavy one to come, Williamson's fall show was decidedly toned down. ""I'm moving away from hippie in favor of a polished elegance,"" he said backstage.</p><p>Signs of this shift were visible in a wonderfully collared coat of varying lengths—and in too many variations, the most notable of which were made of a Lurex-shot mohair bouclé. Prints were limited to three—Aztec, floral, and ombré—and worked into simple dresses with layered hems. The layering of camel cashmere jumpers under pretty sequined pieces was a nice touch; ill-fitting maxi skirts were not. The parade of finale dresses, a series of decorative variations on one style, underscored the generally repetitive nature of the show.</p></div>"
94,fall,2006,f2006,max-mara,"Gray, navy, men's suiting, coats, knits: These subjects of the season are MaxMara's material claim to fame, and for fall, the label's designers grabbed their advantage. Younger and faster-paced than usual, the collection set off at a clip with a bit of sharp styling: There were leggings and glossy pumps worn under short dresses, tailored jackets, and sequin-striped knits. Meanwhile, A-line duffels in gray melton and blanket checks, double-breasted maxi coats, and a few capes stood as a strong reminder of exactly why MaxMara is a go-to label for coats.</p><p>Cutting a neat three-piece pantsuit is a natural for the house, too. They followed through by draping menswear fabrics into feminine shapes: Egg-shape skirts and a strapless wool dress jibed well with the direction of the season. The proportions—skinny legs and voluminous tops, slouchy pants and narrow bodies—touched on all the right trends as well, but why show so many versions? MaxMara doesn't need to prove it can deliver the same shapes in different fabrics and colors. Still, compared to recent form, the modernized message of this collection was a big improvement.</p></div>"
95,fall,2006,f2006,menichetti,"Roberto Menichetti claimed he was ""mixing the bourgeois and the modern"" with his latest designs, and he was so pleased with the result he called it his ""truest collection yet."" Given that claim, it was not a surprise to see echoes of his heyday at Jil Sander in the nineties. The resulting minimalism with a menswear tinge was certainly preferable to the odd monumentalism that has plagued this designer's collections in the recent past, and there was a trim, commonsensical appeal to a navy duffel dress, a navy trench dress, or a winter-white coat dress, cinched in with toggled belts or thin straps.</p><p>The felted wool Menichetti used for yet another coat dress, this one in gray, could have been a Sander fabric. In fact, the depth of fabric research was generally reminiscent of his old boss. The silvery sheen of a quilted jacket was achieved by veiling white silk satin with carbon mesh. The striping on a winter-white felt skirt was created by pulling the dark shade through from the fabric's reverse (a tricky technique called ""agugliera""). A demure plum-color frock was covered by a black overlay of diamond-shape cutouts (the designer called it his ""new lace"").</p><p>In the end, though, this manipulation of intriguing fabrics suggested the collection would be better appreciated up close in a showroom, without the conceptual window dressing Menichetti is so partial to come showtime (e.g., today's distracting soundtrack, which was designed to duplicate the sensation of taking a break in a bird-filled garden, while somewhere in the distance, a noisy nightclub thumps…).</p></div>"
96,fall,2006,f2006,michael-kors-collection,"After last season's road trip through the Painted Desert, Michael Kors returned to the East Coast for fall inspirations—specifically to Jay Gatsby's West Egg and the Harvard stomping grounds of <em>Love Story</em>'s Ali MacGraw. For fans of the designer's trademark mix of tony chic and all-American prep, it was a sure-to-please match.</p><p>Gatsby brought long vests and knickers, drop-waist shifts jauntily tied with bows, and a cocktail party's worth of crystals, mostly on flapper dresses, to the relationship. MacGraw's contributions included rugby stripes, handkerchief hems, paisleys, and cable-knit cardigans. Then there were her collegiate accessories: distressed-leather belts, argyle knee socks, and, yes, those iconic knit caps.</p><p>This is well-trodden territory, of course. The actress, and her early-seventies era, has long been a house favorite. As effortless as the marriage clearly is, it wouldn't hurt for Kors to let his eyes wander a bit for a new, more modern muse. The first place he should look is his own dazzling socialite- and celebrity-packed front row.</p></div>"
97,fall,2006,f2006,missoni,"The new proportions that Angela Missoni mentioned before her fall show were instantly obvious in the egg-shape billow of the first pullover dress to hit the catwalk. Paired with leggings, it set the tone for a collection that veered between the capelike ""egg"" and a loose, drop-waist chemise silhouette. Either way, there was an unprecedented softness to Missoni this season. It was reflected in the subdued color scheme (curry was the most significant accent, but cinnamon, chocolate, dark green, gray, and nude were also prominent), as well as in the off-the-shoulder slouch of a silk dress side-tied over those ubiquitous and fresh-looking leggings.</p><p>There was a richness to the collection that also felt like a bit of a departure. Mink hemmed a skirt in the house's classic chevron pattern, and a capelet in the same fur featured bands of bugle beads. Trompe l'oeil beading, meanwhile, duplicated a scarf-tie on a silver tunic dress, emphasizing the light touch Missoni felt was essential to balance the silhouette. Lightness was evident, too, in a feather-covered dress in a sophisticated pattern the French call <em>ramage</em> that looked something like pussy willows. It had a hint of the japanoiserie that has been creeping around Milan—another example of the way this collection, while hardly revolutionary, felt up-to-date and nicely in tune with the prevailing trends.</p></div>"
98,fall,2006,f2006,miu-miu,"""To make Miu Miu more special and important"" was Miuccia Prada's post-show explanation for taking her diffusion collection to Paris. And <em>special</em> the small Sunday afternoon presentation at the famous Left Bank restaurant Laperouse was. There were mismatched chairs arrayed against the carved wood walls of its many intimate salons, chocolates and coffee on offer, and ashtrays at the ready. The clothes, too, were elevated, thanks to what the designer described as couture touches: Silk was photo-printed with still lifes that resembled those on the eatery's walls, brocade was hand-painted with fleur-de-lis motifs, and the arms of techno-fabric shrunken jackets came in fox.</p><p>The Miu Miu girl, Prada said, is the same as her big sister, only a little more angelic. There was a youthful innocence to the models' white eyelashes, their schoolgirl uniforms, and their impossibly brief lampshade skirts. But provocation was at play as well, evident in the fine downy knits (worn alone or under bustier dresses or spilling off shoulders), in the matte red lipstick, and in the Mia Farrow lullaby from <em>Rosemary's Baby</em> that piped through the speakers. The ""strength"" the designer cited in describing her signature line was less obvious here, but it could be located in military-inspired jackets, some with subtle peplums, and chunky oxford shoes studded with rivets and spikes. Another way the collections related was in Miu Miu's newly luxe, expensive-looking fabrics. Prices will increase, which won't please everyone, but they'll go a long way toward reinforcing Prada's message about the brand's importance.</p></div>"
99,fall,2006,f2006,monique-lhuillier,"New mother Monique Lhuillier designed her fall collection, she said, in a ""nesting phase,"" and though the show didn't move her aesthetic forward, it was good to see the L.A. native feeling at home in the tents, effectively displaying her strengths.</p><p>Lhuillier loves the nightlife, especially if there's a red carpet involved, and her gowns, as usual, were award-show friendly. A black, re-embroidered lace sheath with an exaggerated collar framing the face was a definite entrance-maker. Tulle shrugs hovered at the shoulders of dresses like puffs of smoke, and a blue corseted trumpet gown with Juliet sleeves had a Cinderella-at-the-ball prettiness. Soft makeup and upswept hair added to the glamorous effect.</p><p>The accessories were another story: The less said about the ""jewel-on-a-tulle"" necklaces the better. Day silhouettes, which included swing coats and bell-sleeve jackets, may well have achieved the ""more covered-up look"" Lhuillier was after, but there was no hiding their vintage-style heaviness. It would also be nice if the designer traded the sixties for another decade next season. But daywear isn't what people come to Lhuillier for; it's her special way with a gown that keeps them lining up for more.</p></div>"
100,fall,2006,f2006,moschino,"The invitation featured a Scottie dog peeking out of its kennel and the preshow Campari was poured from bottles wrapped in little kilts—but even that was scant preparation for Moschino's full-on Highland fling. From the moment that a clan of kilted men filed out to line the backdrop (where they subsequently stood sun-glassed and stone-faced), Rosella Jardini and her team went wild for all things Hibernian. After the show, Jardini claimed the theme of every Moschino collection follows on from the first fabric she takes to—and this time, it happened to be plaid. But that wasn't the only discernible influence here. Moschino contributed to Dita Von Teese's autumn trousseau, and the spirit of burlesque's leading lady hung heavy over the tartans, velvets, and crepes that were tailored into shapes straight out of a 1940's melodrama. La Teese herself made a late entrance, husband in tow.</p><p>This being Moschino, there was an element of gleeful kitsch in the parade of Scottish references. That Scottie dog turned up as a print. Tartan swung wide in a smock dress, slithered as a strapless cocktail, kilt-buckled all the way down, or came cropped into a jacket paired with a pencil skirt (with a huge patent belt cinching the silhouette). In this context, an ivory silk blouse worn with a black pencil skirt, and wool knee-highs seemed like the sort of outfit Jean Brodie might have worn if she were a <em>Maitresse</em> rather than a Miss. But there was also a less themed side to the collection that exercised a more subtle appeal: take the striped blouse and full flannel trousers with a little black velvet cape. A black taffeta gown, meanwhile, looked ideal for the next time Balmoral Castle rolls out the red carpet. This show might not have been everyone's cup of tea, or drop of scotch, but all in all it was rather fun.</p></div>"
101,fall,2006,f2006,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez's fall collection was a study in contrasts. He played with two ideas: volume and its absence. The former had him experimenting with ballooning skirts with something of the ballerina to them. The latter, more familiar territory, saw him revisiting his rigorously seamed sheaths, but in color combinations a shade more offbeat, say black, white, and baby pink. Silk insets on a wool dress looked geometric in their precision. And coats, though no doubt soft to the touch, called to mind a warrior's armor. Perhaps that's why Rodriguez has so many fans—his structured clothes make them feel protected (or put another way, held in), and sexy at once. If they call for a frame that has little in the way of the superfluous, so be it.</p><p>After dark though, Rodriguez mostly avoided his signature seaming, focusing instead on simply cut, above-the-knee tanks and sheaths saved from plainness by elaborate, all-over embroidery. A white glass-beaded dress was further embellished with clear plastic paillettes. And one silk faille shift was so densely woven with silver it resembled chain mail. As for the floor-length gowns that have made him a favorite of his front-row guest, Oscar nominee Rachel Weisz, there were none to be seen on his runway. Rodriguez must be saving them for her red carpet victory lap.</p></div>"
102,fall,2006,f2006,nathan-jenden,"Nathan Jenden has an impressive résumé: educated at Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art; work experience with John Galliano and Daryl K; creative director at Diane von Furstenberg. None of that, though, could have prepared him for February 10, 2006—the day that Jenden's wife gave birth to a son on the morning of his solo debut. Happily, the designer seemed to take it all in stride. Fulfilling a long-held dream, he took a bold, confident first step, presenting a collection that was as hard-edged as the venue—the Inn at Irving Place—was precious.</p><p>Saying he was inspired by ""the drama of a Goya silhouette,"" Jenden opened the show with a ruffled puff-sleeve shirt, stark white over black jodhpurs. He had the most success with his reworking of men's suiting, creating an attractively sharp, lean line; standouts were the jet-beaded jackets, and a tuxedo suit at the close. A reversible jacket and corset pants, while amazing close-up, had less impact on the runway. Evening found the designer veering from the minimal (a tight vest-skirt combo) to the theatrical—but his short infanta dress hit a high note, and the finale dress, with its ruffled sleeves, was satisfyingly graphic. Though it might have benefited from an edit, this was a well-made collection that shows Jenden has a strong voice of his own. Diane von Furstenberg, on hand to cheer her employee's efforts, is not the only one eager to see how he develops.</p></div>"
103,fall,2006,f2006,naum,"A quick read of Naum's press notes confirmed that designers Waleed Khairzada and Julia Jentzsch are still focused on high-tech textiles: materials described included ""antibacterial cotton"" and a scary-sounding combination of wool and Lycra with a ""paraffin temperature-control system."" Those notes also indicated that the designers have let some color into their somber, futuristic world—purple, green, and ""Yves Klein blue,"" to be precise. Despite that welcome dash of levity, however, black was the basis of the designers' second outing, which had a Donna Karan/Thierry Mugler eighties feel.</p><p>Khairzada and Jentzsch are less interested in trends than in clothes that <em>work</em>, via fabric technology and quality construction. But their fall collection also works in another way, with a range of office-friendly pieces. A white cotton shirt worn under a gabardine dress updated Karan's ""easy pieces"" ideal, and color made suits look both feminine and professional. Khairzada and Jentzsch are talented tailors, but at times the severity of their clothes verges on <em>Blade Runner</em> territory (all those leather inserts on the inner arm). Pleated pants were overly voluminous, but two draped jersey dresses showed a softer side to Naum, a label still forging its identity.</p></div>"
104,fall,2006,f2006,neil-barrett,"Neil Barrett couldn't have picked a better moment to debut his women's collection. Suits are in the ascendancy, and this Milan-based British menswear designer cuts a mean one. For fall, he worked two themes: formal eveningwear and the army. That translated into trim black coats inset with satin cummerbunds (a timely detail given fashion's ongoing obsession with the waist), curving pencil skirts with tuxedo stripes, and lapel-less jackets, all tailored with a military precision. Slim pants with a sexy swagger were a highpoint, especially for those of us who miss Helmut Lang. Structure is Barrett's calling card, but he didn't lose his sense for proportions when he did soft, belting a boat-neck sweater over a flaring double-layer skirt. His last look—a pleated cocktail dress with a trompe l'oeil effect—was the most feminine of the bunch, perhaps indicating where this talented designer will take his womenswear next.</p></div>"
105,fall,2006,f2006,nicolas-andreas-taralis,"Nicolas Taralis is moving up in the ""ones to watch"" ratings. A late evening slot meant it was a test of endurance for even the hardiest show-goer, but the audience, dotted with the tired faces of international buyers and editors, held on to witness this young German-Greek designer's third collection. What they saw was, in essence, a cross between masculine tailoring and gritty jeanswear, the emerging generation's representation of the school of Helmut Lang and Hedi Slimane (hardly surprising when you know that Taralis studied under the former in Austria, and worked with the latter in Paris).</p><p>There's something precise and Northern European about this designer's way with a tail-coat military jacket, a high-collared shirt, a lean, leather-revered tuxedo, and a pair of skinny pants (shades of Karl Lagerfeld in here somewhere). Taralis' distinctive take on the season's ubiquitous cape is a cloak with sharp shoulders that looks good short, in menswear jacketing fabric, or longer, in gray herringbone. Those pieces—as well as a dull-gold lamé blouse with flying sleeves and black, sparkle-flecked evening suiting—pass muster as nongirly formalwear. The other side of Taralis, though, comes straight out of the underground Berlin <em>bierkeller</em>: lean, rockin' black denim, crosshatched with a suggestion of bondage straps; sleazily cool patchwork black or gold leather parkas and bombers; ink-stained asymmetric cocoons made of chopped-up sweatshirts. As a whole, it made for a microcosm of the shapes and somber tendencies of the season, with a young point of view that's looking increasingly confident.</p></div>"
106,fall,2006,f2006,nina-ricci,"Lars Nilsson tried to pull off a curious mix chez Nina Ricci today. Perhaps emboldened by the success of his preppy spring line, he set out to inject a bit of the sportif into his delicate, feminine fare—but it didn't always stick. The show's first look—an organza mille-feuille dress topped with a bronze cord vest and jacket—came across as quite heavy, even if you ignored the riding hat that was shown with it. Nilsson seemed to get bogged down in the details of his sportswear. A pea coat with three-inch bands of beaver fur above its cuffs was undeniably chic, but it's harder to picture his uptown girls sporting the skinny, cropped-below-the-knee page-boy pants of a three-piece suit in mustard corduroy.</p><p>What his soigné fans love him for is his easy way with a dress. Several of the versions he showed today featured an artsy, swirling print, while the others came in those multicolored layers of organza, chiffon, or silk gauze. His facility with such concoctions makes spring a natural for Nilsson. His next challenge is figuring out how to translate the weightless drift that distinguished last season's Empire-line gowns to fabrics with a more substantial and sophisticated heft.</p></div>"
107,fall,2006,f2006,noir,"After an enthusiastic reaction from international buyers last season, Copenhagen's Peter Ingwersen packed up his avant-garde tailoring to stage his first show in London. His sharply focused and beautifully made second collection has echoes of Boudicca and the much lamented Helmut Lang. That's manna for women who crave a mean-cut pantsuit and an empowering way to play with the classic (but never dull) aesthetic of that other great Helmut, the late Mr. Newton.</p><p>Of course, living up to the standards of that ultrasophisticated look is a tall order. Tight cutaway jackets, high-neck satin blouses, fine leather pants, and an astrakhan Poiret coat all cut the right silhouette: voluminous top, skinny leg. And the use of midnight blue with black hit a note of the season. Unfortunately the thin, wan 16-year-olds who struggled along the runway crippled by their heels distracted from clothes better suited to 6-foot-tall Nordic power-women. Production values aside, though, this is a collection that's already scoring a direct hit with customers on three continents.</p></div>"
108,fall,2006,f2006,oscar-de-la-renta,"Let the rest of New York go punk. While other designers flit from one influence to another, Oscar de la Renta has made a four-decade-long career of staying true to his brand of ladylike elegance. All of his signatures were there for fall: lavish handiwork, smart day suits, ballerina dresses. You could argue that he had a few too many of these last and that the show as a whole ran a little long, but why quibble when there was so much here to please the Oscar faithful.</p><p>For fall, de la Renta focused on his tailoring, sending out a parade of jackets in metallic brocades, embroidered cashmeres, and lean, cropped shearlings. These were paired with simple, full-leg trousers or knee-length skirts, alternately embellished with rosettes and trimmed in fur. Of the latter, there was certainly no shortage. Lippi-cat and chinchilla coats with puffed three-quarter-length sleeves and swingy full skirts were two of his runway's most covetable pieces. His socialite clients will have to move fast if they want first dibs.</p><p>De la Renta has a master's eye for color—that chinchilla was olive, not standard-issue gray—but his most brilliant after-dark confections came in body-loving black. Strapless satin with velvet trim, passementerie and lace with a plunging neckline—each one was lovelier than the last and just the ticket for a memorable night.</p></div>"
109,fall,2006,f2006,paul-smith,"In a season when people are talking about a return to tailoring, Paul Smith chose his moment to launch a new line of men's suiting, shirts, coats, and brogues rescaled to fit girls. Men Only, as it's ironically called, was inspired by a line of Katharine Hepburn's: ""A woman can't always do what she needs in stockings."" What a woman needs was clear from the first look: an easily cut brown pantsuit with a blue-and-white striped shirt, beige cardigan, and loafers.</p><p>The idea of Smith making a seasonal return to tailoring is a bit laughable, of course, because it's been the bedrock of his business for decades. Making well-cut jackets and trousers is a fine art that isn't learned overnight, and Smith is a man who knows what he's doing. Close up, the detail he lavishes on such things as linings and cuffs makes this collection a delightful and trusty resource for everyday pieces. The show might have played this trump card a bit more strongly, though. In the end, the emphasis was skewed more toward Smith's eternally soft spot for a sexy bluestocking. Flocks of girls in glasses, wearing panne velvet polka-dot dresses and other vintage-inspired frocks overwhelmed the tailoring. But never mind, it's nice to know it's there.</p></div>"
110,fall,2006,f2006,peter-jensen,"Something in the naive and self-deprecating character of Peter Jensen's shows always hits London audiences in their soft spots for parody and fantasy. For fall, this almost evangelically nerdy Danish designer brought smiles to the bleachers with a collection about Helena Rubenstein, her fabulous stash of jewels, and frumpy-couture style. Big on boufed Carmen-rollered hairdos worn with pearl bands, the collection was Jensen's gentle way of renavigating the ubiquitous fifties trend.</p><p>Formal matching plaid skirts and kimono-sleeve tops opened the show, followed by forays into ""at home"" lamé cigarette pants and many of the now inevitable bubble-shaped cocktail dresses and skirts that once made up the wardrobe of a 1950's New York socialite. Jensen also added his own spoofy homage to Madame Rubenstein's extensive jewelry collection by trimming necklines with big chunks of faux emerald and diamond Swarovski crystals. The results were cute and fun, which is precisely what keeps Jensen's customers banging at his door.</p></div>"
111,fall,2006,f2006,peter-som,"With the gilded prices Peter Som's confections command, there's not much excuse for a pair of dresses that came down the runway with busted zippers. Details do matter, after all—especially at a runway show, where hundreds of the world's most deeply detail-obsessed people are watching a designer's every move. It was a shame about those distractions (which were repeated when the models inexplicably came out again unchecked for the finale), because Som delivered a youthful yet elegant fall collection that had much else to recommend it.</p><p>Inspired by the Ascot scene in <em>My Fair Lady</em>, which he described backstage as ""graphic and romantic at once,"" the designer worked primarily in black and white, with an occasional detour into silk chiffon prints. Long shorts, shown in graphite wool or a shimmery flannel, along with a pinafore dress worn with a lantern-sleeve shirt had a bit of Eliza Doolittle before Professor Higgins got his hands on her. But the majority of the looks, from the bejeweled jet-black astrakhan coat that opened the show to the last net-overlaid taffeta gown, will certainly pass muster in high society.</p></div>"
112,fall,2006,f2006,phi,"There was more than a whiff of Anglomania at Phi today, where one of Andreas Melbostad's points of departure was the work of British designer Ossie Clark. Melbostad began to take an interest in Clark while researching the prints that found their way into last spring's Phi collection. But the English influence goes beyond the sort of decorative devices Ossie favored; it's visible in Melbostad's construction techniques and in the only-for-the-bold, Biba-esque palette of purple and black.</p><p>Despite the influences, the show didn¿t feel referential or vintagey. The designer tweaked spring's flare dress silhouette with mostly engaging additions like cossack collars, keyhole necklines, and peaked shoulders. He also showed some terrific workmanship, especially when he pieced garments together in Deco patterns. A black Deco-print skirt, for example, was constructed in part with zigzag-shaped swatches of the same printed fabric—but in white—radiating from hips to hem.</p><p>Coats and jackets are Melbostad's strength, and this season they are bold, with peaked shoulders and dramatic collars. Sometimes they were worn with high-waist, flowing flared pants, which possessed a distinct Euro sex appeal. His boots aimed for same, but fell a little short. It hardly mattered, though, because all eyes were on the quality and construction of the clothes. This collection marked another step in the slow but sure-footed evolution of Melbostad's vision.</p></div>"
113,fall,2006,f2006,pollini,"If no connection immediately presents itself between 1960's It girl Penelope Tree and a potentate of the Ottoman Empire, Rifat Ozbek found one in the essential simplicity of their respective uniforms: the shift dress and the caftan. These two items were the alpha and omega of his new collection for Pollini. The dominant shape was the shift, topped by a matching coat of the same length and paired with flat boots or little metallic heels. The combination looked dressy in a Lurex tweed, and urban-easy in chocolate-brown leather. ""Short, fresh, young""—that's what Ozbek said he was looking for. He compounded the effect with abbreviated swingy coats in yellow or black mohair.</p><p>Sienna Miller is in Milan and Edie Sedgwick is on everyone's minds, but a post-show Ozbek was quick to point out that his take on the Factory Girl era was much more glamorous. In fact, he had in mind Truman Capote's ""swans"" at the author's legendary Black and White Ball (several of the mannequins were masked by Philip Treacy). The decoration, though, came straight out of the recent exhibition of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century caftans at Manhattan's Sackler Gallery. The tulip design from a sultan's robe was duplicated in damask for a shift, coat, bag, and boot ensemble, and the patterns of Ottoman tiles were interpreted in black and gold on a short, high-waist, kimono-sleeve shift. There was a youthquake glamour to this notion that carried through to the jeweled necklines and fur-trimmed collars and cuffs. If simplicity was indeed Ozbek's original yardstick for the collection, his congenital inclination toward sheen and surface inevitably disposed him toward a coat in silk, embossed so it gleamed like an oil slick.</p></div>"
114,fall,2006,f2006,prada,"There was no mistaking the new attitude that was unleashed at Prada for fall. It charged out of the gate, looking young, angry, sexy, and serious—and dressed to tackle real life. ""I'm tired of being so sweet,"" declared Miuccia Prada. ""We women should go back to strength—and the sober side. Stop trying to appeal to everyone, and go out into the world.""</p><p>As the woman who invented the lady look, Prada has a right to be the first to kill it off, and that she did, stone dead. Her models, dressed in short chunky gray sweater dresses, parkas, and signature towering platforms, carried briefcases and notebooks under their arms, as if hurrying on the way to some advanced seminar on contemporary politics. In the designer's words, ""We should study.""</p><p>A young woman who wears a monochrome leopard-print coat with bristling fur sleeves, or a parka with an animal attached to its back is not looking to be taken as cute. Nor are her disconcerting layerings of corsetry over sweaters aimed at being come-hither. Still, in articulating a revolutionary wardrobe for this independent young thinker, Prada is only keeping true to herself. The elements—parkas, nylon raincoats, bombers, down-beat knits, lining-fabric skirts, and buttoned-up shirts—are actually the pieces on which she founded her business. The sporty pieces are shinier and more sharply glamorous, the coats come with fur clamped to the pockets, and the air of nineties techno-utility has disappeared. But in the end, this was Miuccia Prada calling up a side of her character that has always been there—a complex, questioning female intelligence, always up for confronting reality head-on.</p></div>"
115,fall,2006,f2006,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Preen's Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton staged their show on a stark white sweep of a runway set against the panoramic glass windows of a brand-new London office block. The setting lent a clean, modernist vibe to the look they've been working on for a couple of seasons now: short, body-conscious, and asymmetric, with a lot of wrapping at the waist.</p><p>Taking an early-nineties photograph by Mario Testino of Nadja Auermann—all blond-beigeness, endless legs, and vermillion lips—as inspiration, they opened with an oatmeal wrap coat tied in the back, with a hemline several inches above the knee. That was followed by jersey dresses, some cut like aprons, then many more variants on the theme in shades from ecru to pearly gray. Preen has developed a strong way with color; the show's high point was a passage of bright red that gave graphic punch to its silhouettes. On the downside, the sophistication these designers are striving for isn¿t yet in their grasp. They could double their impact by showing half the pieces, which might also give them more of a budget for better fabrics. Both moves could bump them up to the next level.</p></div>"
116,fall,2006,f2006,proenza-schouler,"Just when everyone was reaching fashion week saturation, Proenza Schouler's Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez came along, and in a panoply of velvet, ponyskin, leather, and metallic lace, shook the audience out of its Thursday morning malaise. May we suggest that they make this their permanent time slot? Like spring, their fall show was rich with exquisite handworked details, but rendered as it was in a stained-glass palette of magenta, violet, moss green, and black, the effect was more baroque. Except, that is, when it came to the collection's silhouette, which had a strictness that last season's lacked. There was air in a tenting cashmere felt jacket with a cutaway back, but the pencil skirt it was shown with, like nearly everything else, followed the lines of the body. Sexy. But in a rigorous, sophisticated way that some of the designers' youthful peers might do well to learn from.</p><p>Now, back to that stained-glass concept. McCollough and Hernandez elevated color-blocking to a subtle new plane. Not only did the elbow patches of a collarless coat come in a contrasting hue, so did the yoke, hemline, and darts. Paneling was a recurring motif, too. A silk velvet sheath was overlaid with thick seams to create an intriguing trompe l'oeil effect, while decorative zippers, which also turned up as trim on shoes and booties, replaced the seams on shells and skirts. Another skirt, encrusted top-to-bottom in crystals, seemed altogether too precious to sit on. But silk jersey dresses, the architectural underlayers of which glittered with embroideries, will look effortlessly cool waltzing down the red carpet or shimmying on the gala circuit.</p></div>"
117,fall,2006,f2006,paco-rabanne,"""Paco Rabanne was always thinking about the next generation, what they would want to wear,"" said Patrick Robinson, who inherited the design mantle at the French house three seasons ago. In seeking his own answers for a contemporary audience, Robinson looked to a couture collection Rabanne did in the late eighties, one in which he experimented with huge bands of fabric that wrapped any number of ways around his clothes: crisscrossing the torso, circling the waist, slung over the hips. That decade has proven a popular reference point this season, but Robinson's jackets, with their pronounced epaulets, double lapels, patch pockets, and inverted pleats, looked newer than most. No glass ceiling could stand up to those shoulders. And when you consider how elaborately constructed the jackets were, no pants could either, which is why he sagely came up with the collection's sleek leggings.</p><p>Robinson's banding concept produced some great items, from tailored shirts in soft gray sweatshirt material to a short houndstooth cape with rectangles of fabric draped from just under the bust to the lower back. For evening, the concept was somewhat harder to pull off. Stiff ruffles of fabric that ran up and down the sides of a black sheath came off as slightly tricky, and there was a little too much folding and pintucking on a navy cocktail number. The surface treatments on his dresses, accomplished though they were, threatened to obscure the main attraction—the wearer's body underneath. His tough-chic jackets and coats, on the other hand, showcased it.</p></div>"
118,fall,2006,f2006,ralph-lauren,"Rustle up your riding boots: For Fall, Ralph Lauren organized a Highlands hunting trip, complete with glen plaids, cashmere jodhpurs, sweeping carriage coats, and swaggering horse-blanket capes. It was inspired by what he called a ""modern shooting party,"" but of course it will work perfectly for those whose idea of the great outdoors is the jaunt from townhouse to town car.</p><p>Lauren's women's collections are at their polished, elegant best when he weaves haberdashery into the more feminine elements. The jackets of three-piece plaid suits had a peplum kick, and the matching pants a fitted cut far sexier and more youthful than last season's pinstripes. Finely tailored blazers were paired with soft leggings on the runway, but there were also slim suede pants to satisfy clients in search of more structure. After the loden-and-olive opening, Lauren moved into rich black velvets, some embellished with gold braid and bullion, in keeping with the show's horsey inspirations.</p><p>For evening, the designer's theme was at its most literal, and least persuasive, in patchwork taffeta tartans. And we've seen the gold-and-crystal-embroidered tulle dresses that closed the show before; they're flirty, if a trifle light. A black satin column with a high neck and a dramatic bare back, on the other hand, is the last word in urban-huntress chic.</p></div>"
119,fall,2006,f2006,ralph-rucci,"Chado Ralph Rucci and Karl Lagerfeld: The two shows that closed out New York fashion week represented opposite ends of the fashion spectrum. Lagerfeld, who showed downtown, values youth and change; uptown, Rucci honored, as always, seriousness and consistency. Each designer has his groupies, with Martha Stewart front-row for Rucci's fall collection.</p><p>Chado is never about big surprises or theatrics, with seasons mostly distinguished by whichever virtuoso technique Rucci happens to have focused on, and how he applies it to familiar silhouettes. Thus, fall was about woven cane, perforated leathers, and tone-on-tone embroidery. And that's enough, because the workmanship of these clothes is truly marvelous, and always worth coming back for. Take, for example, the opening look: an openwork jacket with layered pieces of lambskin appliquéd in a tortoiseshell pattern. Or a floor-length sable with a hand-woven cane coat worn over it like a cage. Strange, and amazing. Furs were luxe to the max: Imagine sable dyed blue and worked into an anorak, or honey-colored and wrapped around the body like a cocoon. Rucci's most youthful pieces tend to be his jersey and crepe dresses; for fall, they were pieced and in a harlequin pattern, some worn with Dean Harris' dramatic jewelry. But the evening's showstopper was an off-the-shoulder black velvet gown fit for a modern Madame X.</p></div>"
120,fall,2006,f2006,richard-chai-love,"Last season, Richard Chai offered a fresh take on American sportswear, rethinking preppy classics by adding some signature origami construction to them. Fall found him exploring a sort of Japanese-style deconstructionist mode. Clearly the designer was challenging himself, daring to experiment with varied fabrics (cashmere gauze, Jacquards) and textures (brushed and boiled wools), while pushing his talent for construction into new areas.</p><p>For the most part, crispness was out, draping was in. If the folds of Chai's cashmere wrap coats were cleverly arranged, other drapey separates—some with asymmetrical closings—seemed disheveled. But the main problem was the off-kilter proportions; shorts were strangely paired with long coats and jackets, and the boiled-wool pants were cuffed at a height that made them seem more shrunken than cropped. Nonetheless, a pair of bias-cut skinny pants in suiting fabric was undeniably sharp. Chai showed a new emphasis on evening, offering flowing silk rosette dresses—in magenta, and a lovely smoky lilac—with romantic details at the back. But one missed the really wearable day clothes, often interpretations of classics, to which he usually gives a distinctive spin.</p></div>"
121,fall,2006,f2006,richard-nicoll,"Men's shirting, velvet bows, gray herringbone tweed, dotty voile, green corduroy, and black patent leather: On paper it reads like a disaster in the making. Still, one of fashion's big pleasures is the surprise of being proven absolutely wrong by a designer. Once in a blue moon, in the right hands, the most-unexpected things suddenly look fantastic together, and that's exactly what happened at Richard Nicoll's first solo show.</p><p>Nicoll (an Australian who graduated from Central Saint Martins with a master's degree) said he was inspired by Victorian housemaids, but what he presented was a completely original look free of the historical whimsy that turns so many young designers to mush. It involved voluminous, self-striped white leg-of-mutton shirts tied at the neck with black velvet bows, tight bras or bodices layered over them, and either pegged tweed pants and eighties biker jackets, or soft, slouchy cuffed cord shorts. It takes a lot to pull such complicated elements together into something crisp-looking, especially when it's all styled with polka-dot stockings, high ankle boots, and the odd pair of patent gauntlets, but that's what Nicoll did. Better still, seen separately, all those pieces are beautifully made and totally wearable—particularly his shirts, which look like they could be the foundation of a nice little business on their own.</p></div>"
122,fall,2006,f2006,rick-owens,"With all those layers of wool felt, cashmere, and fur blanketing the runways in New York and Milan, this is Rick Owens' moment. Few designers do dark quite like he does, and he played to his strengths for fall with such items as an extraordinary, apocalyptic black puffer coat that looked as if it were sewn from an inflated life raft. Who knows if it¿ll float, but it hugged the torso like a dream, its lapels rising almost to the chin then cutting away just above the waist to a tapered back.</p><p>Owens worked less statement-making fabrics into similar body-framing shapes. Some of his best jackets came in silvery linen inset with shrunken vests of peachy-gold washed leather. Those orchid-petal lapels he did last season? They've blossomed into double-breasted jackets.</p><p>The designer had stripped away some of his familiar goth affectations—notably, the models' ghostly white makeup—but he didn't stay away from that aforementioned dark side for long. It appeared in the form of felted wool boleros trimmed with ruffles of knit and worn over high-waist cropped pants, as well as in a series of almost minimal suits—the straight seams of which set them apart from his signature bias-cut fare. It also materialized in a trio of drapey black evening dresses. Slit down to there, the gowns' easy, billowing forms made a lovely counterpoint to the rigor of Owens' daywear.</p></div>"
123,fall,2006,f2006,roberto-cavalli,"Step through the looking glass into a world where a brocade robe manteau that reverses to silk mink (think sheared mink, but thinner) could be considered as daywear. This is the parallel universe of Roberto Cavalli, and it was fully explored in a collection that married Paul Poiret's silhouettes to the opulence of Leon Bakst's Ballets Russes and the fashion sensibility of London's bright young things in the early 1970's.</p><p>Though lavish as ever, this presentation could actually be considered a departure for Cavalli, with its softer volumes and almost decorous cover-ups. Sure, there was a bias-cut leopard-print gown under a sable jacket but—as Roberto's wife Eva was eager to point out before the show—the new Cavalli woman is less of a show-off. Hence, it was out with the body-limning corsets and in with those enveloping, reversible robe manteaus. One sable-trimmed number was lined in kimono silk and banded with orchid-toned velvet. Other linings made liberal use of lace and gold leaf, intimate details designed for the private pleasure of the wearer. The best examples suggested the kind of heirloom pieces that might—as Bakst's costumes did—end up at auction. On the other hand, a leopard-lined full-length military coat with a huge red phoenix traced down its back in beads and feathers had a little too much Vegas about it to be taken seriously.</p><p>As far as the here and now goes, a gray flannel suit with jumbo-leg trousers had a hint of the Thin White Duke, one of the icons of this season. Dropped-waist flapper dresses, meanwhile, should be popular with the twenty-first century's <em>jeunesse dorée</em>. And a glamorously elongated stretch of cinnamon-color jersey was Cavalli's version of a long T-shirt. Daria Werbowy, who wore it in the show, coveted this item afterward—and why not? She has the body to show it off to advantage.</p></div>"
124,fall,2006,f2006,rochas,"The fact that his first model was carrying a miniature ladder, and wearing a sooty-black suede pantsuit with a jacket unfurling to a buttoned-up Victorian vest was the clue. This was a collection inspired, as Olivier Theyskens said, by ""chimney sweeps. But more relaxed and very refined. A lot of black and gray—and the idea of climbing up to see the clouds above the city.""</p><p>In other words, Theyskens is a poet at work, a Belgian poet to be specific: a young man well equipped to evoke the dark and edgy side of the fashion mood without losing sight of either pragmatism or romance. He did that by taking the colors of coal, smoke, and the fugitive shades of urban twilight to a collection that ran from skinny tailoring and boyish shorts to puffy-skirted cocktail dresses and airily textured evening gowns.</p><p>One of Theyskens' strengths is the way his confident, unhurried personal style allows subtle developments to unfold without reneging on the work he's already firmly established as Rochas signatures. Thus, the trouser suits he introduced last season are now appearing in new variations—sometimes with fitted vests, sometimes with narrow cuffed pants or double-layered jacket lapels. Meanwhile, he's refining his highly influential covered-up dress shapes, sliding in a long-sleeve ladder-knit sweater dress alongside black bobble-lace cocktail dresses with skirts stiffly padded to stand out from the waist.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""74dqrr""></div></div><p>Ultimately, what sets Theyskens apart is a uniquely nontheatrical ability to shade romance into realism, and if there's anyone who's responsible for the turning of the tide toward restraint, it's him. His evening gowns, with their sweeping, undulating petticoats, were a perfect example of that. Even though they had such presence, they were rendered with quiet simplicity, printed with roosting birds on telegraph wires, or trailing narrow scarves floating like ether from the shoulder.</p></div>"
125,fall,2006,f2006,rodarte,"Kate and Laura Mulleavy showed a 21-piece collection today that was exceptional in its sophistication. The self-taught designers are obsessed with how clothes are made—stitch by stitch, bead by bead. They'll study Chanel couture to learn a technique, painstakingly hand-stitch a dress, chase down rhinestones from the twenties… whatever it takes to realize their vision. For fall, they said they were ""intent on doing very soft abstractions,"" so they worked their signature ""waves""—ruffles of fabric which seem to float on the surface of garments—onto jackets worn with slim pants, and into the folds of accordion-pleated dresses. You could call it poetry in motion.</p><p>Each piece seemed to have been conceived in the round, with the back of the garments as carefully ornamented as the front. One pleated dress with quivery tendrils fore was artfully shredded aft. A scallop-trimmed coat, meanwhile, was a feat of detailed stitching; each flap, the sisters explained, was satin-backed, lined, and faced. Of course, all this handwork translates into some bracing prices, and Rodarte is emphatically not for day dressing. But the pleasure the sisters clearly take in their work is contagious.</p></div>"
126,fall,2006,f2006,roksanda,"It takes some character to charm an audience with a cocktail collection at breakfast, but Roksanda Ilincic, twirling her stiff brocade volumes and tulle ruffles among the tea tables at Bibendum, managed that little miracle. This Serbian designer (yet another Central Saint Martins graduate) has garnered a faithful following who enjoys watching her increasingly confident, quirkily feminine ideas about what to wear to a party.</p><p>Ilincic is one of those designers who's in love with Balenciaga-type shapes. Her coats, with their tiered sleeves, swooping swing backs, and trapeze lines all echo fifties silhouettes, but there's something in their execution—a raw edge, a nutty pompom button—that makes them personal and modern. ""I really wanted to push the shapes, to overexaggerate details like the volumes and pleating,"" she said of a collection hand-made by seamstresses in her hometown, Belgrade. Duchesse satin dresses, with twisted folds and odd asymmetries, and new pieces in light wool rounded out a collection that is becoming a highlight of London fashion week.</p></div>"
127,fall,2006,f2006,ruffian,"Last month, Ruffian's Brian Wolk and Claude Morais won the Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award in an unprecedented tie with newcomer Phillip Lim of 3.1. One suspects the prize might've been theirs alone had they infused their vintage-inspired designs with a more obvious nod to modernity. Judging by a wool jersey dress that opened their National Arts Club show and a ginkgo-print silk chiffon number, both of which featured miniature pleats, they now sense the need to head in that direction. A shirtdress with a banded hem and two thigh-grazing jumpers with oversize pockets also exhibited a pared-down, almost hip attitude. Other looks, especially those cut from a matronly silk jacquard, seemed out of sync with what's current. The duo's clothes already hang next to Oscar de la Renta's at Saks, but if they want to appeal to a younger client, as Oscar himself, fortyish years their senior, has made strides to do, they will need to keep shedding such anachronisms.</p></div>"
128,fall,2006,f2006,saint-laurent,"Stefano Pilati's influence has spread exponentially since his first YSL collection, the spring 2005 outing that—right off the bat—launched wide, waist-cinching belts and tulip skirts on the fashion world. Since those are the looks and proportions so many women are living in now, Pilati has become a force whose every subsequent move is analyzed for updates. This season, he articulated the next big shift likely to replace froufrou femininity. He's been thinking, he said, about ""powerful clothes women might want to wear. A sort of versatile uniform.""</p><p>Harder and sharper yet just as desirably luxurious, this collection steered more in the direction of the things Catherine Deneuve—not to mention Helmut Newton—enjoyed about YSL in the sixties and seventies: a point spelled out in the slick black PVC trench, leather blouse, <em>maîtresse</em> pinafore, form-encasing sequin cocktail dress and the odd suggestive mink pussy-cat bow that punctuated the show. (The fetish-chic elements offered a unique spin on ""restraint,"" this season's buzzword.)</p><p>Pilati, however, was clever enough not to belabor the oft-repeated S&amp;M mode to communicate his ideas about the new power woman. His most newsworthy contribution here was to make belted, form-fitting tunics, and back-buttoned tops look sexy—possibly for the first time ever. These are plain yet chic clothes (included among them, a shorter, sharper version of his tulip skirt) that can get you to work feeling fab. Yet there's more to Pilati's consideration of what women really want out of their wardrobe—and life—than a dutiful monolithic career suit. As he explained, ""You can wear a tunic over narrow pants, with a skirt, or as a dress. And I've seen from watching my sisters how sexy it is to unbutton something at the back. You need a man to help."" That's the sort of insight that will take a designer far.</p></div>"
129,fall,2006,f2006,sari-gueron,"After her breakout spring collection, Sari Gueron had a lot of people rooting for her. If her fall show didn't live up to some fans' heightened expectations, it didn't stop others from queuing up to sing her praises, nor did it wipe the post-show smile from Gueron's face as she described her inspiration: early-twentieth-century Vienna and its Wiener Werkstätte movement. Yes, it's an era that's been thoroughly mined by other designers, even as recently as last season, but familiarity didn't breed contempt for her lovely-as-can-be pin-tucked cotton and crinkle-chiffon dresses, her black-and-white color pairings, or her printed velvets.</p><p>New for Gueron were pin-thin stovepipe pants that suggested she is just as talented a tailor as she is a dressmaker. They ought to be scooped up by edgier girls who've previously shied away from her feminine fare. Others who are looking for a fresh cocktail silhouette would do well to slip into her navy velvet trapeze dress, a seriously pretty version of what is shaping up to be one of the season's important cuts. Gueron's gowns have made the rounds at fashion-industry events. A red pleated silk gauze number with a black velvet sash—along with the show's closing look, a lace and pin-tucked cotton floor-skimmer—had just the right mix of youth and glamour to earn a starring role on Hollywood's red carpet.</p></div>"
130,fall,2006,f2006,sinha-stanic,"Judging by the sensibly soft and drapey drift of their first three precociously grown-up collections, one would scarcely have guessed Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic were both just 25. Their clothes were accomplished enough to bounce them from the Fashion Fringe competition into a deal with Aeffe, but there was always something not quite right about watching a pair of young designers mature before their time. Well, they're 26 now, and the good news is they¿ve started acting their age, clicking into sync with the short, hard, sexy vibe that's obsessing every other young fashion person living in London.</p><p>Sinha and Stanic took on the early-nineties trend by starting their show with a camel coat—a classic cut, short, belted, and seamed into a bubble below the waist. Skinny pants, cropped jackets, and neat coats followed—all still career-friendly, but made for a woman with a bit more oomph. Business agenda covered, they got experimental with tiny skirts with a drape in back, a leather bubble-skirt dress, and an evening group embellished with almost flashy Swarovski chandelier crystals. There were, of course, some clunkers in the mix, but that counts as a sign of health. Young designers need to make mistakes in order to learn, and it's encouraging to see this couple dare to move forward.</p></div>"
131,fall,2006,f2006,sonia-rykiel,"Chunky ribbed turtleneck dresses, sailor pants, peacoats, and berets in black and deepest navy—Sonia Rykiel's Fall collection started with a laundry list of French gamine standbys. The models, with their frizzed hair, looked the way Madame probably did in the sixties, although it's hard to believe that she would've taken to the streets of the Left Bank in the knit pants she showed today. No one should.</p><p>As the show progressed, the designer's inner flirt emerged. Rosettes dotted the neckline of a mauve chiffon frock, feathers sprouted from a peach silk jacquard cocktail dress, and fluffy furs came in waist- and knee-length styles. None of this was exactly of the moment—Rykiel hasn't built her 30-plus-year sweater business on trends—but it would've been nice to see her try something new, or perhaps something more inspired than her silly finale. Rykiel went into full-on coquette mode at the end of the show, sending out a stream of see-through black lace baby dolls, shifts, and slipdresses. The joke was mostly lost on the non-French-speaking section of the house, but a particularly suggestive ditty on the soundtrack had the Paris editors blushing and giggling in their seats.</p></div>"
132,fall,2006,f2006,sophia-kokosalaki,"It was the largest collection Sophia Kokosalaki has shown on a Paris runway—a full-fledged run-through from short, belted, multi-collared coats to capes, leather bombers, gray tweed cocoon parkas, cocktail bustiers, and old-gold lamé plissé dresses. It all served to demonstrate how strong she is, both in self-knowledge (sticking to the essentials of her personal taste) and in her awareness of the general direction of fashion. ""I never have any one reference any more,"" she said. ""But there was something a bit royal in there that somehow ended up going via glam rock—which is OK by me!""</p><p>Kokosalaki's look always turns on a slightly hard New Order-ish eighties vibe that segues, somewhere along the line, into feminine Grecian draping and pleating. This season, she concentrated on developing the layered cuts that other designers are also showing, making complex swathed high collars, putting a peeled-back cuff on the leg of a high platform boot and articulating movement into the components of a slick brown trench. Those, and her body-molded leather bustier dresses, showed her stricter, urban side, while the Greek girl in Kokosalaki worked up silver organza pleating and draped lamé goddess dresses. Taken apart, there are plenty of great pieces in here—and taken as a whole, it's further indication that she is edging up the rankings as an independent designer with a voice of her own.</p></div>"
133,fall,2006,f2006,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney has had a lot on her plate this past year. New baby, a smash-hit gig for H&amp;M, and a line of attention-grabbing activewear for Adidas. Well done for all that—but has she had enough in reserve to concentrate on her own brand? Her collection didn't really look like it. What she showed—big cocoon cardigans with sloppy collars, skimpy printed jersey dresses, mixed with A-line smocks and swing coats—lacked the stylistic grip and polish expected from a player in the premier league of Parisian fashion. Granted, something in their sixties/eighties spirit glanced in the right direction, but the focus seemed fuzzy.</p><p>The presentation took place in the pompous surroundings of the gilded salon of the Grand Hotel, a habitat perennially associated with the rarefied métier of haute couture showings. Maybe that was a policy choice intended to separate her top line from other things she's doing, but you can't help thinking there are bolder strategies, beyond selection of venue, that could be used to leverage the equity behind brand McCartney. In a season when menswear tailoring is so much on the agenda, she could, for instance, have upped the luxe content by celebrating her signature Savile Row pantsuits, whose cut can't be achieved at mass level. Then again, perhaps a better way to go about it would be to turn her collection into a microcosm of the high-low fashion reality that McCartney embodies. What would excite both critics and her fan base alike would be to see her jeans, sporty pieces, and accessible young-girl ideas cut together with edited standouts from her posher top line. The makings are all there in her personality. Perhaps she just needs the time and space to figure it out.</p></div>"
134,fall,2006,f2006,strenesse,"Tucked as it was between Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan on the last afternoon of New York fashion week, the Strenesse show could've been a nonevent. But Gabriele Strehle rewarded the minimalist faithful with a quietly luxe collection short on the week's omnipresent ornamentation, and long on smartly tailored suits and coats, some in oversize houndstooth, as well as layered cashmeres. With a series of wide knit bands—cummerbunds, if you will—in colors that contrasted with the turtlenecks with which they were paired, the Munich-based designer made a persuasive argument for a knit you never knew you needed. But when she dabbled in ornamentation, as she did with floral-embroidered organza skirts and tank dresses, she lost her way, and her audience.</p></div>"
135,fall,2006,f2006,sweetface,"""I've been working on a couple of period films, so I'm a fifties and sixties fanatic right now,"" said Jennifer Lopez of the influences behind her latest Sweetface collection. The multihyphenate star scaled way, way back from her MTV-ready runway debut of a year ago to present her new fall line in the comparably intimate confines of Industria Studios. The better to see how it's changed, she suggested in her opening remarks. Yes, there's still a heavy street influence—this came across most clearly in the models' inch-long pearly press-on nails—but the line is much more trend-friendly now. Volume, bows, waist-cinching belts—Sweetface has them all. The first two came together beautifully in a floppy navy trench that a few insiders may think looks Burberry-esque. With J. Lo's imprimatur, fashion outsiders—i.e., pretty much the entire population—will think it's the very definition of cool.</p></div>"
136,fall,2006,f2006,tao,"Tao Kurihara's talent lies in her way of gently tweaking a single idea—turning out small, cutely formed high-concept collections, blissfully innocent of confrontational angst. This time, the well-chosen subject of her miniature treatise was ""Stoles,"" Kurihara swathed her girls in all manner of prettily crumpled tiers and ruffles of cotton, lace, and tulle. Walking in socks, and the occasional pair of velvet pajama bottoms, the models looked as if they'd just woken from a lovely dream to pad around the room in dye-dunked cloaks, capes, wraps, and scarves whipped up from old-fashioned frilly bed coverings.</p><p>Part of the artily homespun magic is in the tie-dyed colors—dappled pinks, peaches, violets, and blues, eventually turning to cream and solid black. Another attraction is Kurihara's sensitivity to silhouette and romance. If you want volume and drama, her more avant-garde pieces—like her opera capes, cut in concentric circles of lace and velvet—have a delicacy akin to something out of a Tissot painting of Parisienne <em>jeune filles</em>. What really makes Kurihara a designer to watch, though, is the way her feminine instinct makes her think out practical applications for her poetics. The designer's tulle-frilled neck-wraps compressed all the prettiness of the collection into a single accessory: a scarf a girl can realistically just shove into a coat, before getting going—with a sense of delight—for the day.</p></div>"
137,fall,2006,f2006,temperley-london,"Alice Temperley's second New York outing began with giant white doors swinging open to reveal—in a puff of smoke—Trish Goff standing under a chandelier in a trim gray velvet suit. It was a confident start that suggested the popular British designer was ready to stretch beyond dresses for fall, and she did, with a selection of chic jackets: A slate-gray forties style and a printed, quilted example showed the designer's decorative touch deftly applied to tailored pieces.</p><p>But it's the dresses over which those jackets were worn that remain the mainstay of this label. As always, there were some intarsia sweater dresses, which this season came extra-short and trimmed with sweet scallops at the hem and neckline. Scene-stealers, though, were the pieces featuring the remarkable, often handcrafted embellishment with which this designer made her name. (Her talent is in the details, best appreciated close-up.)</p><p>Overall, Temperley's sophomore show was a sister to her spring one. Although the collection showed an awareness of current trends, with light bubble dresses and forties references, the decoration changed more than the concept—which has, after all, been proven to work.</p></div>"
138,fall,2006,f2006,thakoon,"Thakoon Panichgul, whose first outing was a ten-piece presentation in Chelsea, showed his latest collection at Exit Art, and there were moments when he seemed to get lost in the larger venue. Fall found the designer back down to earth after spring's ethereal show, feeling, as he put it, ""moody."" This meant a collection made of many themes, perhaps too many. Panichgul was passionate about cape collars, and he was also much attached to the corset. Some of these he built into dresses which, when paired with Manolo Blahnik's French-maid-style shoes, looked almost naughty.</p><p>Preshow, Panichgul had hinted that the show would include ""things that aren't what they seem,"" which translated into a black dress with clever hand-painted stitches at the neckline, dresses that looked like separates, and the trompe l'oeil paint prints used for the closing pieces. The most-successful looks were those that captured a sense of Parisian chic. A striped dress and top (worn with skinny pants) had a jaunty Gallic feel, and a camel pea coat, accompanied only by leggings, nodded to Audrey Hepburn in <em>Funny Face</em>. Thakoon is clearly trying to grow as a designer, and his next challenge will be finding a way to keep his earlier focus and clarity of vision as his collections gain in size.</p></div>"
139,fall,2006,f2006,threeasfour,"Fall meant a new name and something of a new attitude for the As Four collective. (They added the “Three” prefix, said Gabi, “out of respect for [ex-partner] Kai and for a fresh start.”) The collection—dramatically presented on models standing on slowly rotating platforms at Deitch Projects—was not a total departure. There were lots of As Four signatures—seaweed-like ruffles and curved seams, to name two. But they were applied with a refreshing lightness—and also introduced, surprisingly, to such wardrobe staples as a hooded trench, a denim suit (shown with a curious pink tendril accessory), and even a caramel-color wrap dress.</p><p>Adi, Ange, and Gabi approached evening with their usual bewitching gusto. A mustardy chiffon minidress had wonderful magenta-trimmed petal sleeves, a bias-cut cocoa column dress featured a chiffon cape back, and the fuchsia ruffled halter-top finale gown had a dramatically low, bare back. There were some heavy moments—the knits, for example, looked a bit saggy—and there was a surfeit of frills, but the collection was mostly focused and accessible.</p></div>"
140,fall,2006,f2006,tory-burch,"A former editor with work experience at Loewe, Ralph Lauren, and Vera Wang—and a pretty-serious fashion plate herself—Tory Burch has enjoyed considerable success since launching her own line in 2004.</p><p>Her classics-with-a-twist aesthetic was to the fore in her fall collection, which was shown at a cocktail party/presentation in a raw space neighboring her offices. Part of Burch's magic is the way she has taken clothes with a very uptown edge and given them crossover appeal. The Madison Avenue venue may not have helped that message, but those who did make their way to 29th Street found the designer in fine form. The signature prints and bit of shine that her customers have come to love were there, and in just the right proportion. Burch's fall had an equestrian flair—pants, including the jeans she is collaborating on with Habitual, were tucked into flat boots. And there were lots of great vests, especially a leather zip-front model smartened up with a bow-tied blouse with ruffles at the cuff. Dress options included printed silks and a jumper-style piece worn over a crisp white shirt—very chic and simple, very Tory Burch.</p></div>"
141,fall,2006,f2006,trovata,"Talk about trial by fire. The Trovata foursome won the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund's top prize in November. Today at the Supper Club, having had less than three months to put together a collection (and with only one previous fashion week outing, a tiny menswear presentation at the National Arts Club 12 months ago, under their belts), they had the industry's most powerful players sitting in their front row.</p><p>Yes, there was the $200,000 award to work with this time, but money can't buy experience, and despite their newfound celebrity, the boys from Southern California are still pretty green. They tried to make up for it with a charming set complete with fake snow, skis, and taxidermy squirrels, and a trio of live acts that included a band, husband-and-wife yodelers, and a rescue dog. Few can resist a Saint Bernard, but it's the clothes that people come to see. The best of these were a pair of wool toggle coats, one in navy, the other white, and a trench lined in plaid with mismatched buttons. The stylist's contributions—polka-dot silk scarves, stripy tights, bejeweled ballerina slingbacks, and bangles—were quirky and sweet. But they couldn't disguise the fact that the collection was thin in parts. Obviously, these young men have talent. Now it's time to get down to the hard work of fabric selection, construction, and fit.</p></div>"
142,fall,2006,f2006,tse,"Augustine Tse's cashmere company has been through a number of identities in the past few years as designers Hussein Chalayan and Richard Chai have passed though its doors. Fall marks the debut of Tess Giberson, a RISD graduate known for conceptual, hand-worked clothes. Her collection was aptly named <em>Protection</em>; it opened with a quilted wrap that suggested warm, embracing comfort and set the tone for much of what followed. The clothes looked inviting—who wouldn't want to be wrapped in a long, hand-knit cable cardigan, worn alluringly over a thin scoop-neck tank? Or how about keeping out the cold in the season's requisite shearling coat, shown here in white?</p><p>Giberson showed a number of short, sexy dresses, which were elegantly accessorized with TEM chain jewelry. Less successful were the loose stockings—seen at Prada last spring—which crinkled down into cherry-red patent shoes by Christian Louboutin. Throughout the show, there was a tension between the seductive (a knitted lace evening dress) and the safe (kilt-like side-pleated skirts). This suggested that Giberson hasn't entirely come to grips with this label's essential dilemma: Is it for a deep-pocketed customer seeking updates of classics, or the more fashion-forward woman? And certainly some will question whether she was progressive enough or has injected enough of her own sensibility into the designs. But there was no denying the craftsmanship. She was creative in pushing the boundaries of what can be done with cashmere; knitting it into puckers, cables, and lace, showing it superfine, even beaded—but always luxe.</p></div>"
143,fall,2006,f2006,tuleh,"The enigmatic Bryan Bradley provided just a handful of clues as to what his show was about, dropping references to Vassar girls, Edie ""<em>Grey Gardens</em>"" Beale, and a stranger with matched suitcases. In the end though, it didn't matter so much who the characters were that populated Bradley's imagination; what counted was that they inspired one of his prettiest shows to date.</p><p>There was a definite East Coast patrician feel to the collection, which opened with ""Vassar Girls"" in slim forties-style pencil skirts that hit below the knee, and continued with ""Suitcase Girls"" in cinched-waist coats. Luxe is Bradley's catchword, and his furs, often combining species, were especially alluring. A white corsage-trimmed jacket and stole was costumey, but in an intriguing Hollywood-studio-days kind of way. The same could not be said of some of the feather flourishes, however.</p><p>Bradley's favorite ornaments for fall were outsize rosettes and generous bows, and his prints, as usual, were mainly florals. Such decorative tendencies notwithstanding, there was an overall feeling of restraint. This was evident in a brown monk's dress and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in an oil-black satin sleeveless dress and an ivory stand-collar one. A geometric red coat in the ""Strangers"" section missed the mark, though.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4smcwo""></div></div><p>Moodier than spring's collection, this show was also more tightly focused. If Bradley was inspired by an ""exotic and distinguished"" stranger, loyal Tuleh fans—each of whom found a handwritten note on her chair—will find the quality and loveliness of this collection reassuringly familiar.</p></div>"
144,fall,2006,f2006,undercover,"What is it about models' faces that designers want to hide? First Viktor &amp; Rolf had their girls don fencing masks; then, later at La Cigale, Undercover's Jun Takahashi shrouded his in pierced, studded, and chain-covered headdresses that evoked medieval armor (as well as—a shade more sinisterly—prisoners in hoods). While they were in keeping with the wrapping and bandaging motifs that held together such dissimilar looks as knit tuxedo jackets and inside-out parkas, the masks were ultimately a distraction, and they even caused a few of the anonymous mannequins to stumble blindly into the audience. Luckily, though, the punk theatrics didn't entirely conceal the fact that the Tokyo-based Takahashi had come up with some deceptively commercial clothes.</p><p>Take, for starters, a creamy silk camisole with ruffle streamers descending both sides of the torso, a camel jacket with frogging decorating the front placket, cuffs, and rear vent, or an asymmetric tiered black chiffon shirt. In a season of protective layering, Takahashi proved himself a virtuoso here. What looked like a sweater casually thrown over a shoulder revealed itself to be a bolero. Later, the iridescent feathers of a cocoon top parted to display a down-to-earth puffer vest. Other pieces were even more playful. A leather stole morphed into a chain-handle coin purse that perched below the shoulder, and a spiral-seamed dress was embellished with chandelier-size crystals, which will make it tricky to sit still. Not that this energetic designer has that on his agenda.</p></div>"
145,fall,2006,f2006,united-bamboo,"From the ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" cover on the soundtrack to the final pair of leggings, United Bamboo's fall presentation embraced the eighties revival wholeheartedly, a little too much so at times. The real starting point for this collection, though, was Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham's new interest in menswear. They showed men's looks alongside the women's for the first time, and later this year they are debuting a store for gents in Tokyo. That meant, according to Pham, that ""the womenswear was designed to go with the men's.""</p><p>The male influence (specifically, the designers had ""dandy street kids"" and the style of post-punk Brit singers like the Jam's Paul Weller and Echo and the Bunnymen's Ian McCulloch in mind) was felt in the choice of fabrics and the styling. A houndstooth jacket and pants had a mannish, eighties-style, dress-for-success feeling. The show's focus also led to some untenable items. Suspendered pouf skirts, for example, showed more attention to theme than wearability.</p><p>There was a concerted effort to play with volume throughout. Spring's sweet bib-front dresses were transformed for fall into baggy oversize ones, including a standout black number worn by Michaela. And among the highlights of the show were the opening bubble coats. Dramatic in their shape, heft, and texture, they filtered in a modern way the work of Cristobal Balenciaga and the Japanese designers who first showed in Paris in the (real) eighties.</p></div>"
146,fall,2006,f2006,valentino,"Leave it to Valentino to come up with a staging scheme to rival the Oscars. His Paris set, with its tall flight of steps at the back of the runway, was easily the match of the Kodak Theatre, the venue upon which a billion pairs of eyes would be trained in a little over 12 hours.</p><p>Descending that staircase, Valentino's models paused for a few moments to let the audience take in the view—a tableau vivant in black and white that drove home his essential message about ""the sexiness of black."" Then one by one, they took to the runway in double-layered—""two-fold,"" according to his program notes—blousons and coats, or houndstooths, herringbones, and chevrons, all of which contributed elegantly to the two-tone theme.</p><p>Less successful was a passage of sequined graffiti prints in jarring Easter egg colors that paid too direct an homage to the eighties art star Jean-Michel Basquiat. Valentino must know that his clients prefer their contemporary art on their walls, not on their cocktail dresses. The quartet of Valentino red gowns that closed the show were truer to his classic aesthetic. Now that this color has taken center stage, who better to turn to than the master himself?</p></div>"
147,fall,2006,f2006,vena-cava,"Vena Cava's Lisa Mayock and Sophie Buhai threw a happening house party on Saturday, showing their collection in four themed ""rooms"" that contained items from the designers' own homes. ""Clothes are so personal,"" Buhai explained. ""We wanted to create a relaxed environment where the clothes could be seen worn like they would be in real life."" The installation was indeed homey, but the outfits were nothing if not sophisticated.</p><p>This was a breakthrough collection for the Parsons grads and Ecco Domani winners, who sat out fashion week last season while building their store accounts. Since their 2004 debut, Mayock and Buhai have been refining their aesthetic, which revolves around easy, feminine dresses and tops, often with triangle cut-out necklines, usually in (printed) silks. Fall found them entranced by Biba: A lilac lingonberry-print dress with a button placket nodded toward the cult British label and was appropriately featured in the ""Boudoir,"" where the models wore groovy headscarves and false lashes. The ""Withdrawing Room"" played host to loose seventies-style pants, and a dressier coat, gold brocade skirt, and pleated tank ensemble. A leather jacket and dresses with Empire waists and appliqué hem inhabited the ""Game Room,"" while gowns were the focus in the more formal ""Dining Room.""</p><p>The setup of the show emphasized the idea that the collection had versatility—that it would work as well on a dinner date as a weekend in the country. The most pleasing thing about these clothes, though, was that they were both fresh and familiar—the sort of pieces, in fact, you could easily imagine (and want to find) hanging in your own closet.</p></div>"
148,fall,2006,f2006,vera-wang,"Vera Wang may be in talks with St. John to become its creative director, but for now she's keeping any ideas she might have for commercial knit dressing under wraps. Her fall show, inspired as it was by Mark Rothko, was a decidedly artsy affair, with riffs on the abstract expressionist's color-block paintings showing up in interesting ways on the designer's silk chiffon dresses.</p><p>The moody palette aside, this was more or less a typically feminine Wang collection. Witness all the decorative details, from taffeta and tulle corsages to swags of rhinestones. In a couple of intriguing instances—a wool gabardine jacket with raw edges, a pea coat with exposed seams—she did venture out of her usual comfort zone to explore more-masculine elements. She soon returned to her dressed-up sensibility, though. Among the show's standouts were a metallic-blue floral-brocade cardigan with coordinating trapeze dress, and an iridescent rose chiffon gown that was layered over a deeper-red slip to create its own Rothko effect. If the presentation occasionally felt repetitive, it's nothing that a sharper edit couldn't fix.</p></div>"
149,fall,2006,f2006,veronique-branquinho,"With her subdued, dark show, Veronique Branquinho joined a growing group of designers using the tuxedo as a fall leitmotif. Trust the Belgian designer not to play it straight, though. At the beginning, a model came out in tails and men's trousers, a delicate silver chain strung across the lapels serving as the look's one womanly touch. By the end, she had a model wearing a slim, knee-length black skirt, the back of which resembled the bottom of that earlier tail coat. And in between, there were plenty more of these intriguing if sometimes overly fussy conceits: an elongated striped vest over matching pants that looked more like an apron dress from behind; neckties made from shining chain mail; and satin girdles topping button-down shirts and peeking out above boyish pants.</p><p>The play between masculine and feminine is hardly unfamiliar territory for Branquinho. For her men's show in January, she presented his and her versions of trench coats, furs, and Aran knits. So it was surprising that the fit was sometimes off, as it was on a standup-collar cropped jacket and a pair of elaborate pants with part of a vest seemingly attached at the waistband like a sort of makeshift cummerbund. Where she looked more assured was with her fine knits and a pair of silk velvet dresses, one in emerald, the other champagne, the back zippers of which were shown provocatively unzipped. They weren't complicated, and that's what made them so sexy.</p></div>"
150,fall,2006,f2006,verrier,"For her debut last season, Ashleigh Verrier, a Parsons grad and one-time Proenza Schouler intern, showed a breezy yet sophisticated 12-piece collection that referenced early American sportswear. Fall also found her looking back in time, in particular to fashion's favorite surrealist, Elsa Schiaparelli, whom she admires because ""she wasn't afraid to experiment."" You can't blame a young designer like Verrier for wanting to do the same, though the result was a presentation that wasn't as tightly focused as her first outing.</p><p>There were some charming silky dresses and blouses delicately embroidered with a bow motif, a nod to the trompe l'oeil bow sweater that was Schiaparelli's first claim to fame. Verrier also nailed thirties glamour, another of her stated influences, with a smoking ensemble and a dramatic long black silk gown with Swarovski crystals. At other times, though, she went too far (or perhaps not far enough). Cape jackets and pencil skirts that extended to the rib cage heavily cited vintage pieces, but without the crucial adjustments that would have rendered them modern.</p><p>Sophomore shows are notorious stumbling blocks for designers, and the issue here seemed to be an overabundance of inspirations. In addition to Schiap and the thirties, Verrier bandied about the twenties, F. Scott Fitzgerald's <em>The Beautiful and the Damned</em>, sailor blouses, even eighties-era Versace. It's no wonder that the collection occasionally looked confused. Still, Verrier's ingenuity was evident in dresses that looked like two-piece tops and skirts, and her attention to detail, as seen in the fine beading on collars, the rope embroidery on a jacket, and the floral velvet trim edging a coat, showed sensitivity and skill.</p></div>"
151,fall,2006,f2006,versace,"At a time when young designers are worshipping at the shrine of Gianni Versace, Donatella glanced around at what's happening and seized the moment with a flick of her hair. If anyone knows about glam-rock and eighties bedazzlement, it is, of course, D.V. As if to gesture toward that point, she opened her powerfully focused collection to an astonishing mash-up of Jimi Hendrix and Michael Jackson. No literal rehash of the past, the rigorously graphic parade of short A-line shifts and navy, purple, and bottle-green patent-and-fur coats strode out on shiny, violet-soled boots and long matte legs, glinting with sharpness of intent.</p><p>Echoing a sentiment expressed by her friend Miuccia Prada earlier in the week, these were clothes ""for a woman who stands up for her opinions."" In other words: <em>Basta</em>, girlie. Instead of plunging cleavage, Donatella focused on shape and ultraluxe contrasts of texture, sending out the most-wantable, fiercely chic coats Milan has to offer. She cut volume into an extraordinary black caban with patent piping and an astrakhan lining, implanted V-shape patent strips into matte jersey and knits, and banded deep ridges of chinchilla into cuffs or wrapped them into weightlessly wicked chevron cocoons. These ideas, along with some glamorously oversize chunky sweaters that flew like ponchos in the back, put Versace once again at the forefront of fashion.</p><p>Even the house's elaborate gowns have been stripped of excess. Shorn of embroidery, their colors—magenta, peacock blue, pearly gray, shell pink, and gunmetal—and technical feats speak for themselves. Never mind if there was a few too many. This collection revealed a new Donatella Versace, in charge and sending sparks on a creative level she's never reached before.</p></div>"
152,fall,2006,f2006,viktor-rolf,"So normal, it's weird. That's the cumulative sensation that comes off Viktor &amp; Rolf's ready-to-wear. This time, their straight-faced rendition of conservative Parisian fashion clichés was all about little black dresses, the French trench, the gray suit, and the crinolined Christian Dior evening dress. ""We wanted a rigorous kind of elegance,"" they said in chorus. ""But not soft. Like armor.""</p><p>The armored propriety was emphasized, rather disturbingly, by the face coverings, which started out as fishnet veils and progressed into basket-weave fencing masks. Meanwhile, a sound piece by Bruce Nauman featured a woman's voice speaking words that expressed a state of emotional sterility. ""Don't touch,"" she intoned, while romantic music played in the background. ""No communication of any kind. I can suck you dry."" As a statement of antisexual isolation, it was pretty chilling.</p><p>The air of art-house surrealism perhaps explains why the clothes were tinged with a literal stiffness of detail. In the first section, the pussycat bows, shirt frills, and flowered corsages on white-cuffed black dresses seemed to be made of some kind of bulky silver lamé. Later, the nipped-waist, circle-skirted trenchcoats, with furling collars and multipuffed sleeves appeared to have had their edges dipped in silver paint. They gave way to the dance-skirted cocktail dresses, one of which had a bustier as hard and metallic as a car fender. It was all, the designers explained, achieved by electroplating the fabric—a technique they'd borrowed from the European tradition of preserving baby shoes in silver.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""mcvzzo""></div></div><p>That slightly queasy, mummified touch—and the old-school fifties posturing of the models—took this show back to Viktor &amp; Rolf's roots in conceptual couture. Still, this is a ready-to-wear collection, and that's the conundrum. Performance aside, most of these clothes will read on a retail rack as nothing more sinister than an exaggerated form of hyper-normal ladylike chic.</p></div>"
153,fall,2006,f2006,vpl,"You're unlikely to see any panty lines at a VPL show, because what started out as a lingerie-goes-to-the-gym line in 2003 has each season become more focused on sportswear. For fall 2006, boy-cut panties and workout-inspired pieces took second place to dresses, cardigans—even a trenchcoat.</p><p>Ecco Domani winner Victoria Bartlett set a laidback mood from the first look. In separates like slouchy ""slope-neck"" turtlenecks, cocoon vests with huge snap closures, and several jackets, the go-with-the-flow vibe was just right. But when it was translated into wide culottes, rolled-up shorts, and pants with pocket pouches on the outside, the flow outweighed the fashion. The color-blocked pieces Bartlett favors—and which often best incorporate the collection's sporty sensibility—looked strong, especially some corset tops and a peach-and-white dress with a little shine. A gray top and skirt cinched at the waist was streamlined and chic, and the highly desirable sneaker boots that Bartlett developed with Report added a cool-girl edge. But the finale looks—just-for-show vests made out of ballerina shoes worn by models with veil-wrapped heads—didn't add much. Bartlett doesn't need theatrics to draw attention to her ever-evolving talent.</p></div>"
154,fall,2006,f2006,wunderkind,"Some interesting things are happening at Wolfgang Joop's Wunderkind. The theme of his fall show was ""a return to order after the First World War,"" and that translated into the sort of dark, yet somehow hopeful, mood that we've witnessed on other runways. The Wunderkind aesthetic is grown-up and luxurious, but it can also be rigorous, as evidenced by the strong, forties-like peaked shoulders that added sharpness to a gray suit and a shawl-collar coat. Luxury came in many forms; a batiked patchwork mink coat stood out. Joop's exercises in layering were less consistent: An apron skirt and caplet jacket worn over a shirtdress, for example, didn't really work. That wasn't the only time the designer veered off course, but all in all, this season found him tapping successfully into fashion's prevailing Zeitgeist, in a stylized and luxe way that is all his own.</p></div>"
155,fall,2006,f2006,y-kei,"Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang's fall show was not really about any prevailing trend; instead, it sought to showcase their dedication to fine workmanship and love of luxe fabrics. The result was a very pretty if sometimes aimless presentation. Kang said that he and his wife had been playing with the idea of ""odd,"" by which he meant potentially unlikely pairings, such as an ultra-feminine chiffon and lace jabot blouse with blue wool slim pants. There's nothing particularly novel about that approach, but if you looked past the concept, there were some lovely pieces here, especially for a girl who likes to dress up. For her, Yoon and Kang designed a host of covetable cocktail dresses, like a twenties number in navy charmeuse with caviar-beaded Poiret roses that would be perfect for a museum benefit, or a chiffon dinner dress that was the essence of discretion. (Next to these, a silver lamé goddess jersey gown looked out of place.) There were standout tailored pieces, too. A wool satin double-breasted trench had an icy shimmer, and a black-and-silver jacket, nipped at the waist and puffed at the sleeve, was sharply cut. But in the end, the point of this collection was that parade of romantic, ornately detailed dresses.</p></div>"
156,fall,2006,f2006,y-3,"The movie-poster-style invitation to Y-3's fall presentation claimed ""the most chilling show ever"" was in store. Hence the moody, cinematic set—complete with a broken window, Hitchcockian crows, and a gnarled tree—that greeted the audience at the Roseland nightclub. But the collection failed to provide the ""thrilling sensation"" that was also promised.</p><p>Owned by Adidas and designed in part by Yohji Yamamoto, Y-3 was conceived as an active-sportswear line, but there have since been efforts to reposition it as a fashion brand. Growing pains were evident today, and—like the wardrobe of a moody teenager—almost all the clothes were black. These ranged from schoolgirl kilts worn with oxford shirts and hoodies to leather jackets that topped vixenish second-skin jeans. Looking for Yamamoto in the clothes can be frustrating. Yes, the paper-bag-waisted skirts from last spring reappeared, and the opening pea coat had a sophisticated cut, but overall the collection felt like an attempt to determine how many different ways the Adidas and Y-3 logos can be splashed about (they were applied to everything from tweed boots to mohair shawls).</p><p>Still, a few pieces were worth seeking out, including a curve-seamed cardigan, a cute mini with a built-in cuff detail, and an activewear ensemble in royal blue that suggested fashion and sports can meet. Y-3 has potential (those covetable separates, that sporty vibe), but first it will have to get over its identity crisis.</p></div>"
157,fall,2006,f2006,yigal-azrouel,"Change is in the air at Yigal Azrouël. The past two seasons have found the New York-based Israeli designer—mostly known for his feminine frocks—moving toward what he calls a ""complete collection"" by upping the quotient of sportswear pieces in his line. Fall's intimate presentation, a vignette styled in a shabby-chic manner, displayed a real evolution and refinement of Azrouël's aesthetic. In fact, the first piece one noticed wasn't a dress at all, but a draped washed-leather jacket worn with a chiffon blouse and pants. Evening looks, meanwhile, featured a dramatic smoking jacket. As for those dresses: A chiffon goddess gown was fetchingly caught at the bodice with strips of velvet, and a metallic lace dress in plum added a shot of color and shine.</p></div>"
158,fall,2006,f2006,yohji-yamamoto,"Let other designers do frills. To Yohji Yamamoto, ruffles, ribbons, bows, and the like are all so much frippery. He may have been championed for some of his couture-like evening gowns in the not so distant past—and for good reason—but Yamamoto has had menswear on the brain for the past couple of seasons. Continuing in that vein today, he riffed at length on his signature chic tailoring.</p><p>If that sounds conservative, there was nothing workaday about these particular suits. The first look, for example, was a blue-and-purple plaid tail coat that came with matching full-leg cuffed pants boasting a paper-bag waist. From there he moved on to black and navy pinstripes, distressed velvets, and a less-successful-than-the-rest tie-dyed wool, cutting it all into oversize—sometimes massively so—two- and three-piece silhouettes. Recognizing that a woman in an unreconstructed man's suit doesn't have the same revolutionary zip it did back in the early seventies, when he got his start, he draped the lot with a dressmaker's hand.</p><p>Elsewhere, the designer acknowledged the trends of the season, introducing layering, proportion play, a mostly somber palette (save for a perhaps unwise turquoise velvet), and a few standout trenches sure to make his retailers smile. And he did do embellishment, but on his own terms: cinching the back of a jacket with a column of D-rings or fastening a coat with a straightjacket's restraints. There was virtually no eveningwear to speak of, save for a couple of would-be gowns converted into drop-crotch pants by way of industrial zippers beneath the knees. No need to dwell on those, but the last two looks of the show were worthy of closer examination. His preoccupation with men's suiting notwithstanding, Yamamoto sent out a pair of intriguing corsets made from the twenty-first-century equivalent of whaleboning that showcased his first true love: the female form.</p></div>"
159,fall,2006,f2006,zac-posen,"From the very first look—a navy peacoat with outsize shoulder pads—you could tell things were going to be different chez Zac Posen. Gone were the frills, the flou, the colors, and in their place were nipped waists and flaring short skirts (thank you, Azzedine Alaïa), as well as the aforementioned shoulders (<em>merci</em>, Thierry Mugler). Posen isn't the only designer riffing on those eighties icons of late, but he's done it with the most authority, and it was somehow fitting that he had that contemporary glamazon, Uma Thurman (the biggest celebrity coup of the week so far), in his front row.</p><p>In the past, Posen has shied away from daywear; practical matters just didn't gel with his take-no-prisoners design aesthetic. His new velvet knit blazer and skirt are certainly office-ready, though, even if there's nothing tame about them. The same goes for the sexy secretary's white umbrella-pleat blouse and navy pencil skirt. For evening, Posen turned out one hourglass silhouette after another, in silver lamé, black faille, and embossed leather. Despite some out-of-step looks, such as two shapeless shifts midshow and a trio of grandstanding finale gowns, this was a strong outing for the designer. Fashion's It boy is growing up.</p></div>"
160,fall,2006,f2006,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo has built a devoted downtown clientele at her 6-year-old Mott Street store. On Thursday morning, a small group of editors and buyers made the traffic-clogged trek from Bryant Park to see her fall collection. It was close quarters, but her clothes didn't disappoint. Curved-seam constructions have been showing up on other designers' runways of late, but Cornejo has been refining these sorts of shapes for seasons. Cocoon jackets looked fresh in claret and ivory tweed edged in silk velvet, and she updated tucked-hem dresses with a gauzy wool floral. Coats, always a strong point, came in alpaca and cinched under the bust Cossack-style. From there, they bubbled gracefully to the knee or flared out at the hips. To these signatures she added capes and leggings, two of the season's key silhouettes. Now all she needs is a larger venue closer to the tents that will give her collection the breathing room and the attention it deserves.</p></div>"
161,fall,2006,f2006,3-1-phillip-lim,"While violinists played classic Prince hits in the background, Phillip Lim spoke about wanting to inject some ""street elegance"" into his popular year-old 3.1 line. The closest the show got to street, though, was a Hendrix-style band jacket worn over a shirtdress and a biker vest paired with a plaid shirt that might have appealed to a Richards sister. Actually, it was a good thing that Lim didn't push his theme to an extreme. The appeal of his pretty-but-cool clothes is that they don't try too hard. Here, that meant a ruff-collar blouse to pair with shorts, a houndstooth trench with rolled sleeves, or a bow-belted skirt. And who could resist a shearling box coat trimmed with rope beading à la Chanel?</p></div>"
162,fall,2006,f2006,6267,"At whom is 6267 aimed? ""<em>Tutto,</em>"" enthused Tommaso Aquilano, who with partner Roberto Rimondi won <em>Vogue</em>'s Who Is on Next competition last season. While 6267's fall collection (the line is named after the number Rimondi was assigned at summer camp) might not actually suit <em>every</em> woman, it had a lot to offer—especially for those with a taste for elegance and an eye for line. Spring's slim-leg, high-waist silhouette was back, and mixed in with the more tailored pants in menswear fabrics was this season's resurgent staple, leggings. The latter could be read as an acknowledgement of the designers' stated touchstones: an eighties sportiness and a fifties couture feeling. Clearly, Aquilano and Rimondi lean toward the earlier decade, as their curve-accentuating dresses and a strict black cape especially showed. Their attempts to forge a ""younger look"" with pleated and bubble skirts were less successful, but they were on track with sweet bead-speckled pleated dresses that hit well above the knee. Hands down, the showstoppers were the feather coats at the close of the show. Combining lightness and luxury, they suggested that 6267 is earning its wings.</p></div>"
1,spring,2007,s2007,a-f-vandevorst,"For today’s show, Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst accessorized their signature mix of sharp tailoring and lingerie accents with nuns’ habits, rosaries, and surgical tape placed over some of the models’ mouths. If they wanted to make a religious-political point, though, their audience—who’d been sipping champagne during the long wait—seemed at best oblivious, and at worst uninterested. This was a fashion presentation, after all, not agitprop theater—and with another show to go to and perhaps a party or two, the issue at hand wasn’t freedom of speech, but, “Have they got pretty frocks?”</p><p>The answer, happily, was mostly yes. A trio of silk numbers in Mother Teresa blue—the best of which looked like an elegant yet simple sheath in front, but was bare at the back—stood out among the show's white, nude, and blush offerings. So did a royal-blue halter gown with a deep plunge and a pleated skirt. Hoods—which appeared on everything from a cardigan sweater to a shirtdress—were a recurring and not too overtly religious trope; the same went for narrow shifts layered over pants. A.F. Vandevorst’s men's vests looked smart and salable, but if it isn’t a sin to put men’s cotton briefs over tights and ask a model to walk the perimeter of the Musée Galliera in them, then it should be.</p></div>"
2,spring,2007,s2007,adam-lippes,"Presenting his sportswear line, Adam + Eve, for the second time, Adam Lippes chose the Banchet Flowers shop in the far West Village as his venue. This made for a cramped, if fragrant, show location. But despite the crush, the clothes looked smart. Inspired by the rich fabrics and photographs from a long-ago trip to Kenya, Lippes balanced an organic, natural element—with obvious African roots—with his all-American sensibility. This juxtaposition of earthy and clean came to life in a knockout cream satin shift with distressed-metal embroidered trim.</p><p>A bright, Afro-centric print on cotton voile was cut into a breezy blouse and paired with crisp pleated shorts. Thick, embroidered cotton eyelet, meanwhile, was hand-painted white to give it a touch of earthy texture, and it showed up in a strapless top as well as a ladylike dress. Combining a bit more sophistication with a solid dose of the sporty edge on which he founded his line, Lippes' collection is evolving each season.</p></div>"
3,spring,2007,s2007,akris,"In a switch from the typical seating arrangements, buyers rather than editors sat at the head of Akris' runway, with the best views in the house. It was a fitting development, since Albert Kriemler's take on the week's black-and-nude illusion dressing trend was less <em>Strictly Ballroom</em> than strictly chic. Akris has become a quiet retail powerhouse on the strength of this designer's subtle and approachable interpretations of runway developments. In addition to those organza dresses with tulle insets or straps so sheer they almost performed disappearing acts, he also did volume. But that didn't mean trapezes or tent dresses. Those aren't his style, nor his clients'. A subtle bustle gave the back of plunge-front dresses in platinum shot silk, striped voile, or coated wool a youthful swing. Likewise, blouson tops were reined in by bands at the upper arm and waist. The season's billowy cuffed shorts appeared here, too, although with the front pocket linings dipping visibly below their hems, they didn't seem as comfortable a fit with the brand's sophisticated sensibilities.</p><p>In a city where the grand gesture rules, this label risks being overlooked. That's why Kriemler and co. invited show-goers to Akris' St. Gallen, Switzerland, headquarters for a quick tour of the brand's archives at a special exhibition last weekend. By all accounts, the Alpine town has an illustrious past as a center for textiles. But today Kriemler looked straight ahead with the show's modern, geometric embroideries.</p></div>"
4,spring,2007,s2007,alberta-ferretti,"You got that old familiar feeling at Alberta Ferretti's show today. Not just because the collection was firmly in keeping with fashion's current craze for weightless fabrics in pale noncolors, but because this is territory the designer has long called her own. It's pretty terrain, of course, but after a strong fall outing that took Ferretti in a different direction, it would've been nice to see a little more newness among the delicate pin-tucked chiffon and slinky draped jersey. Still, Ferretti fans (especially those A-list Hollywood stylists sitting in her front row) will find enough to like, starting with silk charmeuse cocktail dresses and gowns in rich hues like raspberry and cobalt. The shorter versions skimmed the body in front and dipped low in back to flash a bit of skin, while a longer style, worn with bejeweled flats, was belted at the waist with a coil of silver. Tailored pieces were also on point: Short-sleeve coat-dresses came in the season's metallic brocades, and tapering shorts gave a belted jacket a youthful kick. Ferretti has shown that she has a sense for structure. Why not use it on the runway more often?</p></div>"
5,spring,2007,s2007,alessandro-dell-acqua,"At a time when young London designers are raving about Gianni Versace from a geographical and generational distance, Milan's own Alessandro Dell'Acqua chose his moment to join the short-and-sexy chain-mail gang. He has a right, after all. As a junior designer, Dell'Acqua was on the original scene—albeit as an awed spectator—when the twentysomething Donatella and her glamazon friends were hitting the local clubs in the eighties.</p><p>He was smart not to go there too heavily, though. His collection managed to temper the Gianni homage with his own established preferences for slightly couture-ish coats, delicate embroidery, and nude handworked chiffon. That, and the addition of flat python sandals, modernized the look. A few standouts were the animal-print chain-mail dress wrapped in tulle, a cutaway black dress, and a slithery cream jersey T-shirt dress cinched with a snake-print cummerbund. Dell'Acqua got a bit too carried away with the animal theme, however. In smaller doses, it might have worked fine, but hammering on with the snake, leopard, zebra, and reptile looked like catching an idea a season too late.</p></div>"
6,spring,2007,s2007,alexander-mcqueen,"The story of the last few years of Alexander McQueen has been a long, frequently angry tussle between his love of grand theatrics (which often deflect energy and attention from the clothes) and the more sullen straight-up parades flung on to appease the commercial guys (which only deflate his critics' expectations). For the first time, his spring collection resolved those conflicting tensions in a presentation, staged in the round in the Cirque d'Hiver, that framed all his romantic, historicist accomplishments without veering too far in either direction.</p><p>An ensemble of musicians and a dusty chandelier gave just enough background atmosphere to sustain the sequence of gracefully detailed Edwardiana, infanta dresses, and sharp signature tailoring. His collection notes quoted Barry Lyndon, Goya, and the Marchesa Casati, but really this was a revision of all the things the designer does best. Going back over his own history—as well as favorite points in fashion history—is something McQueen has done before; in this case it improved the sense of lightness and delicacy in his clothes. Nineteenth-century bodice-fitted jackets came out with chiffon jabot blouses and long skirts, followed by corseted dresses—some with hard, hip-exaggerated hourglass carapaces—which bloomed into lace-covered skirts. A palette of dusty gray, ivory, and faded pinks added to the poetic rendering of skills he has perfected over the years—both during his stint in couture at Givenchy and at the atelier he maintains in London to make wedding and special-occasion dresses.</p><p>From this last, perhaps, and the young clients who come there, he's learned about the softness a woman wants in a romantic dress today. Still, the standouts were a couple of more modern looks perfect for less dressy evenings: gray pants with versions of the season's tunics over them, one in asymmetric tiers of dusty-rose lace, and the other a gold-leaf-tinged elongated T-shirt. Looking at it from a broader perspective, it's true to say that this self-referential McQueen collection did not contribute to the new debate about how fashion can move on from its fixation with the past. But as a summation of all he has to offer in the way of refinement, it was one of his best.</p></div>"
7,spring,2007,s2007,alexandre-herchcovitch,"It would have been easy for Alexandre Herchcovitch's collection to be overwhelmed by his inspiration, the Ndebele tribe of Zimbabwe, who are known for their brightly painted houses and love of beading. But the designer, a Brazilian crazy for color and pattern—which he often juxtaposes in cacophonous combination—successfully avoided literalism to create a powerful and personal show. The first dozen looks were true to past form, if not newsworthy. The fun started when Herchcovitch wed his penchant for punk to his African theme, introducing a print that had Ndebelian-style geometry, but which depicted razor blades instead of traditional motifs. The designer also showed subtle, textural jackets and pants made entirely of beads. The punk message was furthered by swing-back jackets in kelly green paired with kilts, and shorts with spike-trimmed hems. Simply folded wraps, closed with beaded safety pins, translated tribal blankets into viable toppers. The vertiginous shoes were another story, but spring found Herchcovitch for the most part walking on solid ground.</p></div>"
8,spring,2007,s2007,alice-roi,"The starting point for Alice Roi's spring collection was <em>La Petite Voleuse</em> (The Little Thief), a coming-of-age film directed by François Truffaut and starring Charlotte Gainsbourg. That movie was released in 1988, and the show's soundtrack (Black Flag, Smashing Pumpkins, Cake) and boxy, flared-shouldered silhouettes also referenced the late eighties/early nineties, a time when fashion was more bold than frilly. In other words, there was less emphasis than usual on the girly prettiness Roi fans have come to know. Familiar ruffle-sleeved blouses and pinafore-style dresses played supporting roles to tougher zip-front jumpers and skinny-legged pants, and one notable pair of bleached jeans. The resulting mix wasn't always on target. Roi described the collection as being a battle between ""pretty, girly and more conceptual clothes, between hard and soft,"" but it's not hard to see where her heart lies. The pieces that stood out gently filtered prep looks through an eighties filter: a tee dress with a collegiate cardigan, a slouch jacket, a jumper over a blouse—all nick-able Roi staples.</p></div>"
9,spring,2007,s2007,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"Vivienne Westwood isn't about to relinquish her role as English fashion's resident provocateur. If today's graffiti print combining ""Free Leonard Peltier"" and ""I am expensiv"" (sic) scribbles raises a few eyebrows, so be it. (Ditto for the doodles of the male anatomy that she used for a cape and a sheath.) And if the collection—which ranged from a black skirt suit, draped and tucked at oddly graceful angles, to a remarkably simple, subtly bejeweled blue-velvet bustier dress—wasn't a huge step forward, well, that's not really why people keep coming back.</p><p>It's the sheer audacity of the spectacle that intrigues. Snow White stomped down the runway in a purple-and-blue bustier top and yellow ball skirt straight out of the Disney book, but for a few extra inches of cleavage. One of Westwood's favorite models from back in the day, Sara Stockbridge, also made a memorable appearance. If she wasn't smoking a cigarette, she was vamping for photographers, who haven't seen such antics in ages. What of the clothes? Piece by piece, there were some beauties, like a loden green nipped-waist jacket or a deep purple strapless taffeta ball gown with striped lining. But, for all their intricacies, they almost came off as afterthoughts.</p></div>"
10,spring,2007,s2007,andrew-gn,"It's not hard to imagine the social schedule of the woman who'll snap up the rock crystal-strewn white linen trench or black linen sheath Andrew Gn showed for spring. Lunch at BG, dinner at Le Bernardin, box seats at the opera, season tickets to the ballet. Gn designs for a customer who likes her clothes as precious as her jewels—and doesn't have cause to worry about the dry-cleaning bills. Nary a collar, hem, or cuff came unembellished, and this season, even button closures got the royal treatment.</p><p>Working in black, white, beige, and metallics, Gn kept the show's silhouette short and narrow. Perhaps the richest offering was the coat cut from a silver silk brocade made to resemble crocodile skin. But he also added python to his repertoire, trimming the puffed sleeves of a bolero in the stuff or using it as the basis for an anthracite abstract silk print.</p><p>It's a rarefied world Gn calls home, and to be sure, this show felt repetitive near the end, as one short ombré-beaded skirt came out after another. Don't his ladies have occasion to wear pants? Elsewhere, though, he had his eye sensibly on growth. A one-shouldered cocktail number with a silver sequined serpent coiling from the asymmetrical neckline to the waist should get the youth vote.</p></div>"
11,spring,2007,s2007,ann-demeulemeester,"""Ann is my friend. She makes clothes that make me feel like myself. The clothes of my dreams, of my youth."" So said Patti Smith, before loping off backstage to think out the improvised voice-over she'd promised as part of Ann Demeulemeester's show. What followed were 20 of those good Demeulemeester minutes in which the idea of running away to be a full-time member of her tousle-haired gang of rock/poet people suddenly seems completely compelling. Call it what you like—a look, a formula, a uniform—there is always some new slant in the layers of dark, slouchy, traily coats, jackets, shirts, pants, and skirts in Demeulemeester's repertoire. As a fashion shortcut to looking elegantly wasted without drugs, it works.</p><p>For spring, the designer's injection of change was in the flyaway floppiness of cutaway jackets, the fine ticking stripes used for vests, and the way the air-blown, ombré-dyed shirts were loosely tied to bunch at the waist. Underneath, there were leg solutions that, blessedly, did not involve a single pair of leggings. One was a bias-pieced skinny fluted pant; the other, slouchy, wide pants riding low on suspenders. All these were marched out on another great-looking antidote to a trend that has run amok this season: non-platform, wickedly pointy wedge boots with an ankle strap. That gave the models an easy stride, rather than the tottering gait that's been slowing down other runway proceedings, but as the Ann-gang whipped by, the details flashed: pearls strung into spiderweb vests, and assortments of long, metal chains slung as necklaces. Demeulemeester's is a personal universe, to be sure—but it's as authentic and believable as they come.</p></div>"
12,spring,2007,s2007,anna-molinari,"Anna Molinari designer Rossella Tarabini worked both sides of the male/female divide for spring, interspersing fitted jackets, button-down shirts, and narrow, cropped pants among her usual supershort party frocks. Even the girliest of girls needs a little edge in her life, Tarabini seemed to realize, and the sharp angles and stark whites, blacks, and silvers were a welcome counterpoint to the baby dolls and trapezes, the ruffled knits and point d'esprit in soft grays and pinks.</p><p>The most compelling looks were the ones that balanced masculine and feminine—take, for instance, a blazer worn over a lace tank and a ruffled bubble skirt. But the Lucite-heeled platforms and sheer stockings with back seams that accessorized every exit tended to tart up the proceedings, and despite the fact that Tarabini incorporated many of the current trends—metallic brocades, rosettes, the bedazzled coat—her brief collection came off feeling lightweight.</p></div>"
13,spring,2007,s2007,anna-sui,"The New York Dolls. Marie Antoinette. Suleiman the Magnificent. Leave it to Anna Sui to take these wildly divergent influences and come up with something that not only holds together, but also jibes with the season's key trends. She had white in the form of an eyelet A-line frock; she had short, full skirts made poufy with underlayers of net; and she had prints. Tonight they ranged from Turkish-carpet motifs to florals (red roses, mostly) to novelties. Those were toddlers at play on the hem of a shirtdress.</p><p>Nicely subverting all that pretty, though, were torn fishnets on the legs and arms, a tie-front top that exposed the better part of a model's torso, and zebra-print knickers, along with tunes by Bow Wow Wow. The group's teen singer Annabella Lwin was the starting point for Pat McGrath's makeup, and you could see echoes of her style in a silk jumper dress, among other looks, as well as in the show's Napoleon hats. Sui may be one of New York's more established designers now, but you can still rely on her for a new wave fix.</p></div>"
14,spring,2007,s2007,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi said he had religion on his mind when he began working on his spring collection. But his is not an ascetic style. Born a Roman Catholic, Berardi loves a flourish. And although these clothes—thank heaven—were less ornately layered than last season's and significantly lighter in their overall effect, there were schoolgirl uniforms, vestments, and silver-plated priest collars aplenty, even a few waisted tunics and armor-like boleros with a touch of Joan of Arc to them. ""There's a purity and innocence here,"" said the designer. ""But there's pomp and circumstance, too.""</p><p>Glorified communion dresses—above-the-knee, A-line, and bibbed or yoked—came in organzas, tulles, and chiffons just translucent enough to betray cardinal-red lingerie sets beneath. The lantern sleeves of blackboard-gray shifts and miniature skirt suits, meanwhile, were filigreed with silver like a bishop's robes. Dropping the metaphor, he turned out a spot-on tent dress cut from embroidered metallic lace that stood out from the rest for its simple, welcome wearability. George Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord"" played as the models came out for the finale processional, but holy wasn't the word for Berardi's show. He takes his faith leavened with a bit of sin—and more than enough ostentation.</p></div>"
15,spring,2007,s2007,aquascutum,"Apparently figuring that it was time to focus more on the brand heritage of Aquascutum—a decision that coincides with a change of management at HQ—Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler were in a comparatively subdued mood for spring. Essentially, they've been drafted into the battle of the British trenches, a tricky field to contest when Christopher Bailey at Burberry—but a short walk across Piccadilly Circus—has already stolen the march on that.</p><p>The tactic Herz-Fidler adopted was to go to the archive and abstract the surfaces of the classic Aquascutum mac. They did that by taking elements like pleating, tucks, and smocking and working them onto zones of raincoats and trench jackets. This looked effective, as did a barrel-shaped, olive three-quarter coat, but otherwise the collection seemed to lack the oomph of their first few outings. The addition of more regular-looking shirts and pants watered down the youthful experimentalism of their work, and when they sent out the odd raffia-skirted showpiece, it didn't make a coherent point. That was a shame, because when these boys are on the mark—as they were last season with an acid-yellow Empire coat that has been rapaciously copied up and down the high street—their talent can shine brighter than this</p></div>"
16,spring,2007,s2007,badgley-mischka,"Mark Badgley and James Mischka are clearly trying to move in a new direction and received a standing ovation today for a collection that they described as being ""a little out of the box for us."" The applause was testament to this well-liked duo's popularity, but it was also reward for a show in which they had, for the most part, resisted their tendency to gild the lily. In fact, they claimed to have been inspired by the Shakers, the result of a recent trip to Kentucky. Gone was fall's garish palette; in were white, cream, ochre, bronze, and black. The consistency of the color scheme gave coherence to a collection that focused a bit too heavily on silhouettes that were designed to ""hang from the rib cage and be soft and flowing from behind."" The designers described their embroidered-net halter gown with an asymmetric hem as ""monastic,"" but truthfully, this negligée-like number wouldn't pass with Mother Superior. Badgley Mischka, after all, will never be minimalists, but by paring down their red carpet-ready dresses, they made them more ready for the paparazzo flash than ever.</p></div>"
17,spring,2007,s2007,balenciaga,"""I was thinking of robotic articulation. Car parts. Droids. A boyish silhouette…"" said Nicolas Ghesquière before he was dragged off to sort out a last-minute glitch. Moments later, his incredible futuristic vision was out of the gate: elongated black jackets with a double-layered shoulder line; cyber-goddess dresses jigsawed from patent leather; space-crew shirts with high white collars. Within seconds, the message in these refined, precision-judged looks was sending chills through an audience that five minutes earlier had been on the point of meltdown from heat. Was it worth the wait? Without a doubt. Like last season's Balenciaga retrospective triumph, this is a collection that will reset the fashion agenda, but in a different way.</p><p>Ghesquière said he'd been watching <em>The Terminator</em>, and 1982's <em>Tron</em>, the first blockbuster to combine computer animation with real actors, but that's by-the-by. What's special about these clothes is the way the designer brings his distinctively Parisian, perfectionist genius for cut and exceptional fabric into the consciousness of high-tech culture. It's not one monolithic look, easily captured in a comic-strip subtitle. Ghesquière's intense shows work through a half-dozen separate ideas linked in sequence. This time he moved from tailoring to shiny ""nylon"" silk-swathed dresses, to patent-edged shirtdresses, heavily-hewn sculpted leather and crocodile, metallic pantsuits, and finally to the coup de grâce: astonishing combinations of drapey silk-print tunics and gleaming bronze or gold metal robot-leggings, embroidered with futuristic paillettes.</p><p>If last season's vastly influential Balenciaga collection looked back, this one projects forward into a new era for the house Ghesquière is fast defining as his own. There is no sense of a lurch, because these ideas of space-age fantasy have always been on a slow burn in his work—along with the attenuated line and his deftness with technique. With this collection, he leapt ahead. It's true that thoughts of space-age robo-women have been circulating already this season, as well as reminders that the likes of Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier went there in the eighties, but it takes a major talent like Nicolas Ghesquière to turn a literal reference into something that is light years from pastiche.</p></div>"
18,spring,2007,s2007,balmain,"Since relaunching Balmain last season, designer Christophe Decarnin has scored his share of red-carpet coups—a freshly cropped Audrey Tautou in a short white number at the Cannes premiere of <em>The DaVinci Code</em> being the most notable. So it's no surprise that his focused sophomore effort concentrated primarily on abbreviated party frocks of the sort favored by young Hollywood. His olive, white, or black strapless, one-shoulder, and halter styles continued to inch up the legs, and he also laid on the hardware for spring. Gold chains dripped from one shift, brass studs decorated chain-mail hems, and coils of silver sequins snaked around the neck. ""I was going for an armor look,"" said the designer, whose predilection for such materials may have come from a late-nineties stint at Paco Rabanne. Arching bell sleeves and lantern cuffs, meanwhile, were inspired by Balmain's eighties archives. It's hard to see what the show's metallic leather dhotis and tattered and deconstructed tees—some with panels of sequins, others held together with safety pins— have to do with the house's legacy. But will those same starlets soon be wearing them? You bet.</p></div>"
19,spring,2007,s2007,basso-brooke,"There comes a time when all outrageous young London designers must stop poking their tongues out at convention and start thinking about how to do more than give their 25 closest fans a great laugh. Unexpectedly—for they were the guys who rose to notoriety on their flying-penis prints two years ago—Basso &amp; Brooke have had the good sense to know when to move on (and just in time, since others have already arrived to occupy the city's naughty slot). The collection they showed today left hardness and vulgarity behind, and took off in a direction that looked approachably commercial for the first time.</p><p>For spring, they dropped their overwrought obsession with the eighties and went toward the stylistically safer twenties instead. They used the template of drop-waist, handkerchief-point flapper dresses as a frame for their prints, which were inspired by exotic travel. There were elephants, bamboo, birds, flowers, and moths—with nothing untoward lurking in the jungle, at least that could be seen from a distance. In fact, as the show went on, the realization began to flicker that Basso &amp; Brooke might even be capable of delicacy. Gold-dabbed and silver-shot fabrics, combined with underlying prints, had a butterfly-wing effect that in places looked quite lovely.</p></div>"
20,spring,2007,s2007,behnaz-sarafpour,"After spending part of her summer checking out documentaries about Charles and Ray Eames and mid-century design, Sarafpour sent out a collection of graphic shapes, done in black and white. There were shifts and chemises and also a capelet silhouette that worked best with abbreviated volumes below the waist. When paired with a slightly-too-long pencil skirt and flat shoes, it looked rather ungainly. The designer scored much better with simple shifts bifurcated by large gold zips (her own favorite look). They had a topical Edie zing.</p><p>The collection was heavy on texture, as in an ostrich-jacket-and-white jeans combination, a liquid Lurex sack dress, and a sheer white shift trimmed at the neck with little flowers. But a paper-light sleeveless dress in silk taffeta, its hems delicately ruffled, was much more subtle—and all the better for it.</p></div>"
21,spring,2007,s2007,belstaff,"Belstaff, the 82-year-old company first known for its waterproof, waxed-cotton motorcycle gear and more recently championed by Hollywood costume designers, took a wrong turn this season. The program notes touted technological innovations, from heat-retaining transparent microfiber to a waterproof silk-and-linen blend, but in practice these were clothes designed less for leisure sports than for luring members of the opposite sex. This tough-chic line has always had a certain sex appeal, but its attraction lies in being effortless, not blatant. Here, Belstaff's traditional outerwear was deconstructed into halter dresses and skimpy, snap-covered overalls pieced together like jigsaw puzzles. Sheer nylon, meanwhile, was cut into a long-sleeved jumpsuit and a robe cover-up, and worn over fetishy swimsuits with crisscross straps. Maybe it was the late hour—the show started after 10 p.m. due to daylong rain and traffic delays—but more than one editor wondered aloud if the audience had inadvertently stepped into a strip club. However, a few sharp-looking pieces built on the brand's strengths: notably the brightly color-blocked motorcycle jackets, cropped or hip-length and belted, that closed the show.</p></div>"
22,spring,2007,s2007,biba,"There were plenty of friends in the house for Bella Freud's official launch of the much-adored Biba label. In fact, the front row looked like a lineup of London's fashion and social aristocracy: Jemima Khan and Hugh Grant, Phoebe Philo and her husband Max Wigram, and behind giant sunglasses, Lucy Ferry and Amanda Harlech. These are not regular sightings at any old London fashion show, but proof of a groundswell of affection for Biba's sixties and seventies highs—and for Freud herself.</p><p>""When I looked in the archive, I realized there's so much to play with,"" the designer said. ""The proportions are so good, with that narrow high waist, strangled shoulder, and belled sleeves. And it's sort of casual, too."" In practice, the collection didn't stray far from a more-or-less faithful vintage revival. There were little cord suits, forties crepe dresses, knickers, and denim dungarees, and lots of play with mini, midi, and maxi lengths.</p><p>Still, this is 2006, not 1966, and Freud's Biba is reemerging in a completely different context from Barbara Hulanicki's brilliantly original, disposable fast-fashion-for-teenagers concept. These days, the prices are much higher, and the clothes are aimed at a designer bracket that is almost the opposite of what Hulanicki envisioned. Just goes to prove you can't really go back. To judge from the interest surrounding the label, this is a brand that's going to be pushed hard worldwide, though to cut it in a luxury market it will need a bit more polish.</p></div>"
23,spring,2007,s2007,bill-blass,"In the audience to witness Michael Vollbracht show what was by far his most accomplished collection for Bill Blass were fans like Sigourney Weaver, Liza Minnelli, and Janet Jackson. Not only were the spring clothes eminently wearable—for both the loyal customer and a younger one—but they also respected the tradition of the house. ""To thine own self be true—and to Bill Blass,"" Vollbracht quipped.</p><p>The designer looked for truth in his materials, which for spring included matte jersey, linen, and organza. ""The fabrics rule, and I let the cut do the rest,"" he explained. The result? Neat, fresh looks for day, like sandy-colored jersey suits and dresses (paired with snazzy patent-and-steel shoes from the house's new collection). White-on-white dresses featured intricate embroidery, as did some of the gala evening numbers, including one that was embellished with feathers. The jersey story continued. Stand-outs included columnar raspberry and lavender gowns with open backs that looked modern and that expressed, as the collection did overall, a strong vision of American chic.</p></div>"
24,spring,2007,s2007,blumarine,"As much as Milan fashion week could use a few pantsuits, you don't go to the Blumarine show for those—or for any other surprises. Over the course of nearly three decades, designer Anna Molinari has perfected the art and commerce of the party dress and the little bejeweled cardigans that her clients like to wear with them. For spring, she didn't venture far from the familiar. The first look—a black shirtdress with pearls for buttons and a crystal-encrusted collar—set the mood. Elsewhere, there were petals of chiffon, embroidered violets, and wisteria prints. Yes, Molinari touched on the season's trends—brocade is one example —but her dresses nodded less to the sixties than to Lolita, with nipped waists that flared out to the knee. Echoing that silhouette, taffeta jackets with short, puffed sleeves and mini peplums were belted and worn with A-line pleated skirts.</p><p>Pink is a color of the season, but it's been a Blumarine favorite for years, and this crowd-pleasing show ended with a parade of old-Hollywood glamour gowns in shades of blush, cotton candy, and dusty rose.</p></div>"
25,spring,2007,s2007,bottega-veneta,"It's a tall order to stand out as a voice that champions understated luxury and a complete look aimed at grown women. But, season by season, Tomas Maier has been building an impressive following at Bottega Veneta by doing just that. The designer's spring show worked beautifully as a stripped-down statement of what he has to offer: a subtle beige-through-rose palette, ease aligned with elegance, and stunning detail in close-up.</p><p>Maier's first papery trenchdress hit a sophisticated note; it was a look that drew attention to the all-important accessories: the soft, woven leather bags and high sandals that—with no need for extra doodads or trendy hardware—are the mark of quality that speaks for this house. From there, the show built, developing into a great collection of refined dresses. A couple of them revisited the tight-bodiced, molded-hip silhouette of Maier's last season, now detailed with tiny lines of vertical stitching or abstract quilting, and done up at the back with hook-and-eye fastenings. Better still, the designer followed through with a sequence of short plissé goddess dresses and liquid jersey numbers, some sexily suspended from plaited straps in back.</p><p>For a finale, Maier gave himself the task of thinking new sense into a summer evening gown. For a balmy midsummer night's party on the rolling lawn of somebody's estate, what could be more perfect than a billowy, ticking-stripe shirtdress and a pair of flat sandals? The fact that Maier conjured up an exact picture of his customer, and where she might wear his clothes, is a testament to his growing success.</p></div>"
26,spring,2007,s2007,burberry-prorsum,"Christopher Bailey's formula is to find a piece of British iconography to match the mood of the season, and then apply it to the fundamentals of Burberry's heritage. For spring, like many other designers, he's thinking about making things ""lighter and more joyous,"" and he found the key while leafing through a book of Cecil Beaton's photographs.</p><p>It was Beaton's whimsical early portraits from the twenties that caught his eye most: ""The ones where he used cellophane, feathers, and sequins in studio photographs of his sister Baba and other debs."" Bailey took that as a cue to give the familiar Burberry trench a new treatment, puffing gentle volume into the shapes, and working a palette of palest beige and silvery metallics into lace and high-tech brocades made from lightweight aluminum and silk.</p><p>His best summer coat came narrowish in front with a barrel-shaped volume curving from a yoke in back. Otherwise, there were cute variations on Bailey's short swing jackets, softly belled skirts, and his version of the season's shirtdress. As for the bags, they came big, squashy, and belted with a signature trench-buckle in silver python, a punchy detail to pull the look together. In all? Plenty that will appeal in stores, if no great departure from Bailey's tried-and-tested approach.</p></div>"
27,spring,2007,s2007,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein's Francisco Costa took home the Designer of the Year award from the CFDA earlier this summer. That¿s a lot to live up to, but from the looks of his spring collection, no one put quite as much pressure on Costa as he did himself. Today, he second-guessed his way off his own forward-moving trajectory and seemed to wind up in the archives of Helmut Lang. Yes, there was a lightness to portions of this collection that recalled the work he began last year. But unlike those A-line tent dresses, the transparent fabrics he used today were shirred, pleated, tucked, and folded to the nth degree. In short, they were sorely lacking in simplicity.</p><p>A more streamlined grouping of sporty layered tank dresses, along with cropped jackets and skirts cut from tech-y fabric that resembled breathable athletic mesh had a bit more American ease. And it should be noted that the collection wasn¿t entirely without fabulous items. He put a great oversized black parka on Natalia Vodianova, who was back on his runway exclusively for the first time after giving birth to her second child this spring. Before starting work on next season, Costa will have to learn to trust his own proven instincts again.</p></div>"
28,spring,2007,s2007,carlos-miele,"Carlos Miele opened his Bryant Park show with a quartet of models standing around chatting as if at a cocktail party—a fitting scenario for this collection, which was almost entirely given over to the sort of evening looks one might find at a chic beachside bash. Save for a few shorts and bikinis, it was a parade of sexy, bias-cut chiffon dresses, mostly in bright colors or prints, often embroidered with crystal details, but with little, other than length, to distinguish one from the next. Evident throughout were the artisan techniques Miele uses to delicate effect. Still, the collection needed more variety.</p><p>While there's certainly a market for that dress—in Miele's native Brazil and Palm Beach and other parts—the global customer he is aiming to reach by showing in New York can hardly live by wispy silk confections alone. It would be nice to see the designer acknowledge that life is not always a beach, and bring his sense of flair to pieces that would work for locales other than the seaside.</p></div>"
29,spring,2007,s2007,carolina-herrera,"For spring, Carolina Herrera jettisoned the fifties inspirations that threatened to weigh down her fall collection. With a front row lined with both new and longtime members of the best-dressed list, she seemed to be thinking, <em>Why look anywhere else for ideas?</em> Realism was the order of the day, served with a smattering of couturelike touches and Verdura jewelry. Her trench was cut in black-and-white lace and accented with rosettes. A slim wool sheath—the very essence of urbane simplicity—came with subtle pleating details. And this time, the references to the past were handled gently. A toile sundress was printed with the likeness of Marilyn Monroe, but if you weren't looking closely, you might have missed it.</p><p>That fabric appeared later in the show, underneath a veil of heavily beaded chiffon. If some of the evening dresses were a little busy and overdone compared to her lighter resort offerings, there were at least two that had her gals circling their program notes: One was the finale, a net cocktail number with ribbon embroidery that was right in line with the fun, short dresses seen on many spring runways; the other was a slim matelassé gown with a ribbon sash dividing a rose tank and a deeper red narrow skirt. It was polished, but also effortless—a combination the designer pulled off with a fair degree of consistency in this collection.</p></div>"
30,spring,2007,s2007,catherine-malandrino,"With two-story scaffolding at the back of the runway and New York street noise on the soundtrack, Catherine Malandrino sent out a collection that seemed designed to prompt appreciative wolf whistles from construction workers. There were plunging blouson minidresses, one-shoulder and halter-style black jersey numbers accented with silver chain-mail links, and white-on-white polka-dot poufs (yes, bubbles were a big theme). Subtle it wasn't, and after a pretty fall showing full of day clothes like houndstooth coats, jacquard suiting, and smock tops with tailored pants, it was somewhat disappointing to see her focus so much of her attention and flair for detail on evening clothes, and give them such an obvious eighties slant. On the upside, she showed some strong trenches with dramatic, me-against-the-world collars. And there were two smart suits. One came in silver and another in black, and though plenty sexy, they conveyed a kind of authority that can keep those construction workers at bay.</p></div>"
31,spring,2007,s2007,celine,"Today was Ivana Omazic's third go-round at rejuvenating the LVMH-owned house of Celine. That's no doubt a lot of pressure, especially for one so relatively young and inexperienced. It's almost no wonder that she latched on so tightly to a key spring theme, transparency. When she cited <em>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em> in her program notes, though, she gave her critics some easy fodder. Because despite all of the parachute silk, iridescent faille, cloudlike taffeta, and translucent embroidery, this show felt oddly heavy.</p><p>Weighing down today's jackets were her experiments in double lapels, one—you guessed it—transparent, and the other opaque. Likewise, smartly cut coats ended up looking tricky due to their visible darts, seams, and hems. Omazic was at her best when she put aside her concept—it's a rather familiar one by this point in the season, anyway—and concentrated instead on the hallmarks of Parisian style. She had the trench in an icy gray cotton-silk gabardine, the skirt suit in chalky python, and the L.B.D. in black silk organza with feathers dotting the bustier neckline. These, unlike many of the other looks, conformed to a cardinal rule of French chic: unfussy simplicity.</p></div>"
32,spring,2007,s2007,chaiken,"Julie Chaiken and Jeff Mahshie did not maintain the hyper-focus of fall's show, but instead wandered between three themes for spring: acid-colored silk satins, camping/safari suiting, and ombré. This didn't make for the most coherent outing, though there were strong separates here, and the long, flowy silhouette that they created with floor-sweeping skirts and full pants were a welcome sight among the week's overload of trapeze dresses (not that these were entirely missing at Chaiken). ""We want to move away from the bubble, and are using elastic drop waists for spring,"" Mahshie explained. This lent a sporty feel, as did simple tank dresses and the final blouson jacket. Bold prints and silk satins—especially in blinding chartreuse—struck a jarring note, however. The designers fared better when they stuck to black and white and to outfits that they described as ""easy, pretty, and American—but not in a flag-waving way."" It's not hard to imagine the young Hollywood set taking a shine to Chaiken's coverall for shopping expeditions or a dark ""tuxedo"" short suit for a power lunch under the Cali sun.</p></div>"
33,spring,2007,s2007,chalayan,"The girl walked in and stood stock-still, dressed in a long, high-necked corseted Victorian gown. Then her clothes began to twitch, move, and reconfigure of their own accord. The mono-bosom top opened, the jacket retreated, the hemline started to rise, and—finally, amazingly—there she was, wearing a crystal-beaded flapper dress: a woman propelled through fashion history from 1895 to the twenties in the space of a minute. This was one of six incredible feats of technology and conceptual commentary at the heart of Hussein Chalayan's show. The others also moved through decades—one from the hourglass Dior New Look to the Paco Rabanne metal-link shift.</p><p>Today's spectacle was one of the increasingly rare occasions on which fashion still has the power to astonish, provoke, and send a visceral sensation through its audience. This was fashion addressing the subject of fashion, a dissection of our contemporary habit of recycling ""vintage,"" and an embrace of high technology, all at the same time. It wasn't just the uncanny sight of the self-undressing clothes (tech-genius courtesy of the team who made the hippogriff in <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>) that provided the chills. That would have left it at the level of childlike entertainment. What really gave the show a disturbing sense of wake-up-to-reality was the soundtrack. Here, the changing shapes were connected to the sounds of the twentieth century—fragments of music, trench warfare, the ranting of Hitler, aerial bombing, jet engines, the beating of helicopter rotors.</p><p>Chalayan, rare among designers, is a true now-ist (more than a modernist). He is excited by science, fascinated by world politics, and recognizes the fact that the way we dress is a reaction to the times we live in. Since 9/11, fashion's response to reality has been to hide in the past. Now that mood is lifting, and Chalayan, like Nicolas Ghesquière, is right to be bringing us face to face with something that is, too sloppily, being dubbed ""futurism.""</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tocdns""></div></div><p>This designer's sense of the now is too nuanced for easy labels. For all the tech wizardry, Chalayan has reached a place of serenity and maturity that is producing simply beautiful dresses. Shorn of angst and overt symbolism, his clothes are now young, delicate, ingeniously pieced, and finely layered, using all the techniques he's refined during a decade of experimentation. ""I like graphic play around the body, and if I can get a sense of life in the clothes, I'm happy,"" he said, simply. ""I wanted to prove that my approach is nothing to be frightened of, that people can wear these things."" Even with a collection that included those provocative, morphing outfits, that mission was fully accomplished.</p></div>"
34,spring,2007,s2007,chanel,"With perfect pitch, Karl Lagerfeld dashed off yet another virtuoso demonstration of how to play up and down the classic Chanel scale in tune with any season. It was up-tempo, light and girly, with a cute opening device: a bouncy parade of girls in standard-issue white cotton cabine coats swinging along, attracting all attention to stacks of gold cuffs, link bracelets, chain-and-pearl necklaces, and plastic-Lucite-and-glitter wedges and platforms.</p><p>The segue into the short, A-line, and fluttery was carried off, sans effort, via breezy white flared tops over little black skirts, with a trill on the abbreviated white tucked-front shirtdress, and a high-note from a gold-quilted chain bag. Then the clever bit: What on earth to do with the old, potentially heavy-wash-cloth Chanel tweeds in such a mood? Why, put them with black sequin short shorts—thus chiming with the leggy forties showgirl theme of the moment—and shoot sparkle through the borders of the bouclé.</p><p>Instead of the multitudinous flocks of options he has sent out in the last few seasons, this single-file presentational march condensed everything that can be thoroughly Chanel, yet completely du jour. While he was at it, Lagerfeld also dashed off sporty striped T-shirt dresses, tulle-covered denim, Edie Sedgwick, metallic-scuba, and puffy Empire organza moments, but mostly it was all about those newly wantable accessories. Black leather quilted mini bags, smothered with biker-like metal logo badges, were the final ta-da. In other words, a hit.</p></div>"
35,spring,2007,s2007,chloe,"Since Chloé is waiting for a new designer—Paulo Melim from Marni— to arrive, the spring show was necessarily a case of keeping the brand in a holding pattern. That considered, the team did a respectably unadventurous job of keeping the best-selling items warm: fragile blouses, short Empire dresses and, of course, the shoes and bags. The theme, according to the notes, was Gloria Vanderbilt, which apparently was indicated in log-cabin patchworks (her personal hobby) and that peculiarly seventies palette of ochre, brown, and purple. Meanwhile, there's no change to report in the silhouette, and no news that moved Chloé on from the template set by Phoebe Philo some while ago. The thing this middling collection illustrated best is the gulf between imaginative design and just designing a line. Let the first go, and you are no longer in a leadership position and, in this instance, heading toward the territory occupied, at a lower price point and with more spirit, by Marc by Marc Jacobs. With the best will in the world, this is not the sort of thing people come to Paris to see.</p></div>"
36,spring,2007,s2007,christian-dior,"The pattern of runway events at Christian Dior is forming a kind of paradigm of what fashion, and its marketing, are about now. As a designer at one of the most powerful houses in the world, John Galliano must address multiple global audiences, with the tiny core of fashion-hungry critics at one end and a vast potential public of women who are looking for something to wear at the other. So this is how it pans out: The idea-fueled Dior mania is sectioned off for couture, while ready-to-wear strikes up a conversation directly with the customer.</p><p>That explains the settled-down atmosphere on the spring runway. This was a collection that spanned sensible gray Dior skirt-suits through wearably pretty dresses, with plenty of the obligatory, all-important, and this season gimmick-free chain-handled handbags. The soft, drapey, asymmetric necklined dresses, sprinkled with silver chain or tendrils of gold embroidery, ran through short to gown-length options in the prevailing spectrum of barely-there flesh tones. None of this generated the kind of news to put the fashion pack on trend alert, but it did carry the Galliano stamp in the armor detailing of the suits (translated from last couture) and in the signature drift of his dresses. That placed Dior firmly in the business-like arena of appropriately of-the-moment dressing, a zone an established Parisian label like this has every right to occupy. For the next creative surge forward, watch January's couture.</p></div>"
37,spring,2007,s2007,christian-lacroix,"Should a woman be taken by a fancy for a decorative summer coat, Christian Lacroix could be a label to check out. A hint of his extraordinary couture hand was there in today's belted, geometric jacquard coats, with sleeves that puffed in the elbow region, and in his ivory-and-black Chantilly lace buttonless cardigan. The same might be said of a little gray jacket and wide pants; a jet-beaded, Spanish-flavored red bustle-back Empire dress; or the breakout of earthy browns and a white pseudo-African print on a short T-shirt dress.</p><p>As for the rest, the argument for turning to this collection over others wasn¿t particularly clear. Lacroix had plenty of short organza bubbles and silver-sequin cocktail dresses, but so did lots of designers, and his, though unobjectionable enough, lacked the oomph of personality that gives the competitive edge these days. Other points in this presentation were less fathomable, though perhaps attributable to the designer¿s recent sojourns in Las Vegas, where he¿s opened a boutique. A section of bubble-gum pink printed Western shirts and spangled cutaway bodysuits possibly referred less to Lacroix¿s Arlesian-in-Paris signatures than to Americana and Vegas showgirls. Or possibly not; who could really tell? Either way, they added an off-note, and the sense that this collection hadn¿t been invested with any particular personal passion.</p></div>"
38,spring,2007,s2007,christopher-kane,"Even before his first vivid-orange, elastic-bandage micro dress hit the runway today, 25-year-old Scot Christopher Kane was an international sensation in the making. In the six months since delivering his award-winning graduate Central Saint Martin's show in March, he has not only snagged a consultancy with Donatella Versace, but also found time between trips to Milan to whip up a further 50 fluorescent, frilled, crystal-trimmed, ring-jingling, zip-spliced dresses for his official debut.</p><p>What is this look? Certainly the most intense and best-articulated example of the Versace/Alaïa nineties mania coming out of the London club scene. Driven by lust for eye-socking color and allover decoration, it zings with an amazing new energy and optimism. Or as one wag in the audience put it, ""Oh! Hervé Léger meets disco poodle!""</p><p>Virtually every dress featured the same body-clinging shape and the same length. But Kane had the conviction of thought to run through extraordinary color combinations—red with pink, lime with beige, royal blue with black, flesh-on-flesh, violet with green—not to mention dozens of pattern variations, encompassing stretch lace, chain mail, crystal mesh, brass rings and boudoir ruffles. All this had been accomplished in Kane's rented living room in the East End with his sister, model, and business manager, Tammy—and a little help from Donatella. Before the show, a consignment of shoes arrived from Versace with a massive bouquet wishing him every success. Looks like he's going to get it.</p></div>"
39,spring,2007,s2007,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo is a senior voice in Japanese design, and, in a broader sense, a foreign ambassador for all that can be creative and free-thinking about her nation. In a way—an allusive way, admittedly—she acknowledged that fact for the first time in her spring collection. A giant red spot, the symbol of the Japanese flag, was unmistakably at the center of her collection. ""To me,"" she said, ""It is the purest form of design in existence.""</p><p>Since Japan is at a highly sensitive turning point, with an assertive new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, having just been voted in, it was hard not to see that red spot as the elephant in the Comme des Garçons room. Kawakubo is a channeler of emotion, of course, not a political agitator or commentator. But she took the opportunity to stamp her feelings about the ""pure"" Japanese ethos in the words printed below the red circles on her T-shirts: ""radiant nature,"" ""simplicity, nature, beauty,"" and ""grace and nature.""</p><p>In the end, though, Kawakubo's work is always more about subtext than text, and today that part, she claimed, was ""Cubism."" École des Beaux-Arts surroundings notwithstanding, the clothes—segmented into fragments and reconnected with in-fills of sheer mesh, or delicate overlayers of organza and plastic—didn't seem to have that much to do with Braque and Picasso. She sent out many high-belted deconstructed jackets, worn over shorts or net ballerina skirts. The suiting appeared to be floating apart at the seams, while the dance skirts and white cotton underwraps all bore the Japanese red disc. Overall, the impression was light, unaggressive, and approachable, and the set of Kawakubo's clothes looked like an expression of hope for positive change as Japan's structure slides apart and reconfigures.</p></div>"
40,spring,2007,s2007,costello-tagliapietra,"Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra are anachronisms— witness the lumberjack shirts, the suspenders, the beards, and, since May, the matching ""JCRT"" anchor tattoos. But it goes beyond their appearance. The Brooklyn-based duo—CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists for the second year in a row—are among the few contemporary designers who, whither the wind blows, remain true to their vision. Trapeze dresses? You won't find them on this runway. Instead, they reworked their signature slim draped jersey dresses in earthy Aubrey Beardsley tones. And in a subtle nod to Halston's Studio 54 days, added a few sexy one-shoulder looks to the mix of more demure wrap, Empire, and cinched waist styles.</p><p>New for spring were the embroideries. Gold bugle beads traced the neckline of a tomato red number with geometric precision, and a smattering of pearls decorated the bodice of a white gold frock, as well as a ribbon necklace worn with a purple V-neck dress. They also experimented with luxe wovens like griege and metallic moiré, sewing them into a short-sleeve jacket, narrow pants, or a standup-collar coat gathered at the waist. All three pieces were nice enough additions—timeless and refined—but it's when they work with the fluid jersey that these designers really shine. It may not make for the splashiest runway experience of the week, but it's nice to see a label playing to its strengths.</p></div>"
41,spring,2007,s2007,costume-national,"Sci-fi futurism has hijacked the good sense of many a designer this season, but Costume National's Ennio Capasa managed to avoid that trap. Though he showed his fair share of metallics and holograms, he came up with a concise collection that was more jet set than space-age chic. His strong suits have always been a sense of realism and an awareness of what's sexy, and for spring he concentrated on the silhouettes in which he's always specialized—the sleek, sharp pantsuit (this time with an elevated waist), the abbreviated cocktail dress, the trench. Foundation established, he then added a silver leather belt, say, or harness detailing as reflective as high-polished chrome.</p><p>Beyond the great outerwear—from a streamlined cream cape to an uncomplicated silver leather trench—there were some evening missteps, though. A sheer, hooded gown with slits up the side, for example, might've been killer in a knit jersey, but as it was, it could never walk off the runway. His cone-heeled slingbacks, meanwhile, came a little too close for comfort to those that appeared on the YSL runway a year ago. Overall, though, this show had more of that familiar Costume National edge than his last couple of outings.</p></div>"
42,spring,2007,s2007,danielle-scutt,"The Fashion East show has come to be like a tasting plate in one of London's most original restaurants: Turn up, and what you're offered are three flavors of the best up-and-coming talent. The exercise of rendering each collection down to 12 looks only improves the intensity, and this season, it was Danielle Scutt's fifties-meets-seventies power vixens who knocked the audience sideways. Done up in stiffly towering quiffs, red lamé cocktail skirts, and animal prints made into bodysuits and skintight denim, Scutt's women were not for the tame-hearted—and that's exactly how she wanted it. ""I'm proud to be a woman. I'm not one of the boys. I think clothes should be empowering and sexy,"" said this recent graduate of Central Saint Martins. Among the chorus of voices being raised in praise of glamazon style in London, hers is the first that is female—and the difference shows. Fierce shapes she may have, but the odd vivid-red print shirt and piece of leopard-spot denim made it apparent that this is a girl who also thinks about stuff you could imagine wearing.</p></div>"
43,spring,2007,s2007,derek-lam,"""I want a woman to feel natural in her gestures,"" said Derek Lam backstage after his show. With that goal in mind, he loosened up his fall silhouette considerably, trading in lady blouses for tunics, and leggings for full trousers cuffed at the ankle or right below the knee. He even named a crisp raw silk A-line shift worn over pants the ""McCardell popover dress,"" in honor of the great American designer who made practical clothes for the average working girl. There was nothing average about Lam's homage, though; it was one of the collection's strongest looks.</p><p>Working a masculine-feminine theme, Lam showed loose-fitting tanks as well as a dress in suit lining fabric inset with lace and piped in black. He also elevated madras chemises and pajama pants by trimming them in silk. If it all sounds a little sexless, it wasn't. Like other designers this season, he chose navy for evening. His were draped goddess style and suspended from one braided strap, a style that is fast on its way to becoming a Derek Lam classic.</p></div>"
44,spring,2007,s2007,diane-von-furstenberg,"She called her show ""All About Eve"" (as in the first woman), but Diane von Furstenberg could as easily have titled it ""All About Evolution."" Though wrap dresses opened and closed the show, there were 48 other outfits in between, presenting a huge array of options. A hyper-constructed strapless dress was quickly followed by a slouchy sweatshirt, slipping louchely off a shoulder. Explosive prints shared space with a simple pink shift or a solid yellow coat-dress, buttoned in black. Von Furstenberg said she wanted something ""<em>décontracté</em>,"" and the key shapes were relaxed: smocks, shifts, tunics. Still, the attitude was dressy. If the style of a tunic was simple, its sophisticated, seductive content—python-printed lamé beaded at hem and cuffs—was anything but. The serpent imagery suggested von Furstenberg was more taken by Eve the original sinner than Eve the original innocent. And while this versatile collection was too eager to please to be truly wicked, it was a sexy outing nonetheless.</p></div>"
45,spring,2007,s2007,dkny,"DKNY's sport-in-the-city shtick broke wide open this season to embrace the numerous girl tribes of New York at work and at play, from the Kate Hepburn-ish rigor of a white poplin shirt and full pleated trousers to the Latina flair of a floor-sweeping tiered dress in hot pink. Those trousers came in dark denim, an example of the blend of athletic ease and urban polish DKNY aims for. The same mix was visible in a parka dress, sunray-pleated minis topped with layered tanks, and shoes that looked like a cross between sneakers and platform espadrilles. Excitement was provided by DKNY's new silhouettes: a cropped, zipped linen jacket flared out over short shorts; another dress in hot pink kicked out from its Empire-line bodice. The sheer variety of styles made for some confusing staging at times, but things came into focus with the coats. A black-trimmed balmacaan and a red taffeta trench both achieved the DKNY ideal: city dressing with a twist of indisputable chic.</p></div>"
46,spring,2007,s2007,donna-karan,"You could see traces of Donna Karan's travels in her spring show, from the vaguely ethnic ""cracked earth"" prints to the souvenir necklaces to the incense that perfumed the air with a faint woody scent. If New York's girl tribes were the starting point for her spirited DKNY show earlier this week, she had global ones on her mind for her signature collection. In the end, though, she didn't convey the same authority abroad as she did at home.</p><p>She started with promising wrap dresses, their plunging necklines a sexy counterpoint to the draped easiness of their silhouettes. It quickly became clear that comfort and ease would be Karan's operating principles. A caravan of smocks and caftans fell away from the body in billows of washed silk and chamois. Some had a youthful lightness—you'll see a certain sort of downtown girl wearing floaty tops like these with baggy shorts all next summer. But others, in floor-length black, had an almost witchy vibe.</p><p>In a season when ""pretty"" has become a buzzword, these clothes felt out of sync, and after the chic structure and sharp tailoring of her fall collection, it was a shame to see her go all shapeless. Karan knows the true path, of course, but this season she took a wrong step or two.</p></div>"
47,spring,2007,s2007,doo-ri,"Nabbing Swarovksi's Perry Ellis Emerging Talent award and one of the ten finalist spots from the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund in a span of three months is no mean achievement. Even more impressive is the fact that Doo-Ri Chung refused to play it safe today. She could have simply repeated the things that brought her to this point, but instead she dramatically narrowed the silhouettes of her earlier forays into daywear, showing sexy leggings with snug, fitted jackets or zip-front short-sleeve blouses. And she exercised restraint with embellishments, embroidering the neckline of a white sheer-jersey top with subtle black metal rather than obvious crystals.</p><p>For eveningwear, she went beyond her signature draped jerseys, adding a print for the first time and cutting it for a cocktail dress and a gown. Stark and graphic, it had a winning simplicity. (By contrast, a chiffon dress with ruffled shoulders and a harness of satin paillettes looked quite wrong here.) Toward the end of the collection, Chung even relaxed enough to show off a hidden wit. Among the 28 looks, which came out too slowly for her end-of-fashion-week audience, was a black cotton halter with a white bib and an artfully askew bow, which she paired with gabardine pants that had a beaded white waistband. The effect? Instant black tie.</p></div>"
48,spring,2007,s2007,dries-van-noten,"Does the late-breaking news about ""the new sport"" raise anxieties—especially coming so hot on the heels of last season's couture-dressing? Relax, and look at Dries Van Noten. Unlike this season's previous efforts, his collection made the proposition of pulling anoraks, parkas, and go-faster stripes back into a current wardrobe feel like the easiest step—and not one likely to land us back in the domain of velour tracksuits.</p><p>First, check his high-heeled sneakers—the Van Noten leitmotif for a new coexistence of chic and casual. The styling of the clothes nailed that refreshing outlook by translating the standard shapes of sport, outdoor, and army-surplus pieces into special fabrics, and giving them volumes and silhouettes that are next-door to the things we're used to wearing already. Thus, a hooded anorak in light parachute silk was cinched with a thick leather belt, the way we've recently been putting tops with skirts. His parkas might be actual coats—like the yellow nylon one with balloon sleeves—or they might become loose cotton parka-dresses with drawstring waists, neatly catching the trends for sack dresses and shirtdresses while they're at it.</p><p>Throughout the show, there were nice ideas for remixing looks, like adding great-looking army sweaters and khaki jackets to more feminine pieces, or putting a gray marl T-shirt under a black pantsuit. As for the sporty stripes, Van Noten stripped them to a single line of white piping flanking the sides of pants, skirts, and shorts—a clever balance between the formality of tuxedo dressing and the looseness of the locker room. In essence, that's Van Noten all over: the comfortable partnership of the casual and the formal, the fashionable and the normal, that makes his clothes speak to the reality of so many women's lives.</p></div>"
49,spring,2007,s2007,dsquared,"Dean and Dan Caten love a production. This season, it was a seaside piazza complete with waiters serving drinks to pretty boys who watched their <em>carinas</em> strut up and down a boardwalk strewn with fishing net. The Capri backdrop was an apt setting for a bright and bouncy collection of Dsquared²'s louche preppy standbys, infused this time with a vaguely nautical air. There were navy blazers with brass buttons, ticking-stripe button-downs turned into minidresses, and wide-leg trousers, along with weekend bags of gigantic proportions. The best of these was a cheeky camel leather tote with the Dsquared² logo in script near the bottom.</p><p>Cheeky, in fact, was the right word for this show, which featured skirts and dresses so abbreviated they barely earned the name. The black lace decorating a khaki suit was more subtly suggestive, but slinky jewel-tone jersey maillots, halter dresses, and a show-closing strappy gown fell squarely into the overtly sexy category. In truth, they looked a little flimsy, but there were also more solid Dsquared² signatures like shrunken jackets, cuffed shorts, and denim, which was shown with their first-ever flat, a patent-leather penny loafer. The Canadian twins didn't add much to this season's fashion conversation, but they did provide a half-hour's pleasant diversion—who doesn't fantasize about a summer weekend in Capri?—and sometimes that's enough.</p></div>"
50,spring,2007,s2007,elie-saab,"The inroads Elie Saab has lately made into before-dark dressing came to a full stop today. Not only were all 55 looks he showed golden-hued—inspired, he said, by the sun of his native Beirut—but there wasn't a pantsuit in the lot. Even Roberto Cavalli, whose glamazon girls the Lebanese designer seems to have modeled his collection upon, proved this season that he knows the value of a no-nonsense jacket. Saab's, by contrast, were cut with stiff kimono sleeves and cinched with a wide leather belt. And as for bottoms, if cuffed shorts or showgirl panties don't suit you, well, you're out of luck.</p><p>Saab's dresses came in two varieties: micro mini and long to the floor. Both gave off a seventies vibe, thanks to batwing and butterfly sleeves, asymmetric one-shoulder bodices, and deep, plunging fronts that had the models worrying their necklines. Metallic sequins were everywhere, arrayed in stripes, chevrons, and polka dots of varying sizes. A few of the simpler pieces, including a sinuous thirties gown, should make it to the red carpet. But why did he insist on showing them with his oversize python and leather bags? If Saab truly wants to grow his business, he should put the brakes on the accessories for now and focus on daywear, and when he does, he'd be wise to go a lot easier on the bling.</p></div>"
51,spring,2007,s2007,emanuel-ungaro,"With six months to prepare after his first rushed season at Ungaro, Peter Dundas took the opportunity to lay out his whole proposition for spring. He arrived here from Roberto Cavalli, with a reputation for hot and sexy, and that's where he fits into the high-color, multiprinted, take-no-prisoners legacy left by Emanuel Ungaro.</p><p>He went at it with all goddess drapes, spots and stripes, animal print, and neons blazing. Minute swathed chiffon body-dresses in electric blue, fuchsia, and violet were followed by skirt suits, in which tight-waisted, scrolled peplum jackets mixed polka dots, flowers, and horizontally ruched stripes. After that eye-socking intro, there were—amongst many other things—lashings of highly worked chain mail with leopard, metallic leather, or exotic-insect mosaic sequin patterned jackets, and a finale of gowns in fluorescent lime or pink georgette.</p><p>Whether you get the point of this depends where you're coming from. From a London perspective—where the Paris-based Dundas has spent time sourcing broken-mirror dragonfly and hot-lips jewelry from Andrew Logan—the pushed-to-the-limit high-eighties styling has legs, at least for the inner clique of indie-mag clubsters who get off on Christopher Kane. Stylists with an eye for the futuristic power-woman vibe will also lock onto the laced-back pants and suck-in, jut-out jacket silhouette of his safari suits.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qhbukg""></div></div><p>From other perspectives, though, what can be said? Horrible, said the tasteful. To cut Dundas some slack, though, Ungaro himself in his raging glory years was always a love-or-loathe designer. Now that the first generation of devotees is (hopefully) too old to turn back to this flaunt-it aesthetic, the question hanging over this house is whether there are paying customers ready to step up to Dundas' smorgasbord of neo-eighties Parisian excess. If there's a chance, it's in the emerging markets of the newly rich, the rising global population who couldn't care less about critics who left this show with a blinding headache.</p></div>"
52,spring,2007,s2007,emilio-pucci,"Rachel Zoe was the first in line to congratulate Matthew Williamson after his Pucci show. That sighting, more than anything, clinched the point of the collection that had just left the runway: It's for the kind of young and ravey party girls who look to Zoe for tips, ideal for being papped in from beach to nightclub, Ibiza to Bali, Saint-Tropez to South Beach.</p><p>As you'd expect from a British designer who's made it his business to hang with It girls, Williamson treated Pucci to a dose of what's going on in the London club scene: i.e., allover print leggings and tops (like Basso &amp; Brooke) along with what his notes called ""the body-conscious silhouette of the late eighties and early nineties"" (translation: slinky jersey and chain mail). He took Pucci archive prints and punched them up into the brightest turquoise, aqua, peach, purple, orange, and electric blue, styling them with mirrored cutout wedges, sixties enamel disc pendants and giant cuffs. The effect? Beyond garish in parts, but those skimpy terry bikinis will no doubt get all the long-lens exposure for which minor celebs jostle.</p></div>"
53,spring,2007,s2007,emporio-armani,"This season, the Emporio Armani show was less about what was on the runway than what was going on around it. Giorgio Armani transplanted his presentation to Earls Court exhibition center in London, invited Beyoncé Knowles and 50 Cent to perform in front of a massive audience, and—for good measure—asked Bono, Bobby Shriver, Ashley Judd, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Cattrall, and Alicia Keys to speak. It was all in aid of charity—the RED initiative to raise money for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Bono spoke of the 30 cents it costs for the two pills it takes to tackle HIV, and proselytized the RED slogan: ""Shop till it Stops."" As for the collection, in broad terms, it was all short: short taffeta dresses, shrunken jackets in pinstripe, and shorts done in a half-dozen varieties of tailored and puffy shapes, and it all came in black, gray, red, and white. Certainly, the clothes conveyed Armani's abiding aesthetic, but in the end, the event wasn't about fashion trends—it was about pulling back to look at a bigger picture.</p></div>"
54,spring,2007,s2007,erdem,"The adjectives being thrown around after Erdem Moralioglu's show—pretty! gorgeous! lovely!—haven't been heard much at the London shows. There's been plenty of buzz about the nineties trend, of course, but there's always room for a well-done, individualistic something else. Erdem provided just that with a collection that he said, ""was about Perry Ellis and early-American sportswear, combined with something decadent and eighteenth century, like lace and tapestry.""</p><p>In his third season since winning the Fashion Fringe competition, he worked at refining the ideas with which he began: dresses, pleating, and a taste for odd botanical and ornithological prints. Encouraged by the fact that his most expensive things have sold best, and counseled by his twin sister, Sara—""My best critic!""—he came up with a great blend of highly wrought laces and encrusted embroideries, smartly contrasted with cleaner, sportier elements, like raincoats cut from traditional Mackintosh fabric, that kept the mood from becoming too sweet.</p><p>Some of the pieces, like a trapeze dress made from panels of rose-patterned lace and cream satin pleats flowing from a heavily embroidered yoke, are beautiful one-offs. Many were executed using deluxe French lace donated by Sophie Hallette in a sponsorship deal, and made by people who used to manufacture for Roland Mouret. ""I lucked out this season,"" he declared after the show. ""I felt much more comfortable with this collection, like I found my feet.""</p></div>"
55,spring,2007,s2007,erin-fetherston,"Erin Fetherston's pre-show soundtrack—a music-box version of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star¿—set the mood for a collection that was girlish and romantic, if risk-free. The Parsons-trained, Paris-based designer's debut runway outing was inspired by the idea of her customer as ""a flower sprouting from a sidewalk in an urban environment."" (Perhaps she had friends like Karen Elson and Zooey Deschanel in mind, both of whom will appear in a short, filmed showcase for Fetherston's clothes that photographer and front-row guest Ellen von Unwerth is shooting.) In any event, the floral theme was used literally—models wore daisy chains in their hair, and Fetherston's wafty trapeze dresses and flower-shaped bell skirts were embroidered with petals. Tiny blooms covered the surface of a black tulle dress; the tendrils of laser-cut blossoms dangled from a white look; and a pink organza minidress featured crinkle-petaled flower appliqués set geometrically. If the rompers and the suspender dresses seemed out of place, Fetherston's pretty take on the popular navy-blue gown should be a hit with the flower children.</p></div>"
56,spring,2007,s2007,etro,"With <em>Star Wars</em> theme music—R2-D2 sound effects, and all—pumping through the speakers, Veronica Etro's lively sixties romp bordered on camp. Less a space-age take on that decade than an eclectic reprise of its bohemian-hippie stylings, the show had paisley silks, patchwork prints, and sequins arrayed in a magic-mushroom motif, all on a base of black opaques and silver platforms. Miniskirts were pleated or flat-front and worn with spring's three-quarter-sleeve, collarless jackets. Dresses ranged from a sleeveless white shift with swirls of geometric color to a pleated black shirtgown tied at the waist, and full trousers were shown with silk blouses and side-fastening vests. She even tossed in a few rompers for kicks.</p><p>Ignore the tunes—which gave catwalker Irina Lazareanu, as well as some in the audience, a case of the giggles—and set aside some of the more outré looks—like the overlong floral palazzo pants, which caused a major spill during Lazareanu's finale lap—and there were winning pieces here. Etro had the season's smock, shirtwaist, and T-shirt dresses—all in a boldly confident mix of colors and kaleidoscopic prints that has become just as big a calling card as the house's famous paisleys.</p></div>"
57,spring,2007,s2007,fendi,"Trust Karl Lagerfeld to tweak a trend just enough so that it takes you by surprise. Like other designers this season, he worked couture details into his clothes for Fendi; but lace, rosettes, and the kind of hyperfeminine frills that have become commonplace on the spring runways weren't on his agenda. Instead, he employed high-tech materials such as black silicone, silver leather that was laser-cut to resemble athletic mesh, and holographic paillettes. ""I wanted to use the most traditional craftsmanship with the most futuristic of fabrics,"" he said.</p><p>Restricting himself to a palette of black, navy, white, silver, and shocking pink, and keeping the silhouette Edie Sedgwick–short, Lagerfeld came up with a graphic collection in which the space-age sixties and the sexed-up eighties played equal parts. There was a metal micro dress with a bow tie at the neck and an iridescent puff-sleeve shift, but alongside those were several looks—a batwing-sleeve number, for example, or a knit fur jacket—that came with wide, waist-defining belts.</p><p>Having introduced the concept of craftsmanship, Lagerfeld also said that he wanted to make it modern, easy, and light. It didn't always work that way. A long, strapless tube dress nearly tripped a model up. Still, how welcome to encounter a designer in Milan for whom high concept trumps commercialism—not that there weren't plenty of best-seller candidates here, including a spot-on fringe bag made from splices of that futuristic silicone.</p></div>"
58,spring,2007,s2007,salvatore-ferragamo,"Salvatore Ferragamo famously supplied Marilyn Monroe with shoes for her steamy role in 1959's <em>Some Like It Hot</em>. On the eve of the label's 80th anniversary, designer Graeme Black revisited the legendary shoemaker's glory days and that celebrated client's shapely, signature silhouette. Day or evening, knit tanks, polos, and cardigans came close to the body and belted, and skirts in everything from khaki cotton sateen to embroidered net fluffed with crinolines were full to the knee. A cotton piqué sundress in a black-and-white floral, along with a crochet coat, tiny leaflike embellishments flitting in the runway breeze, followed the same fit-and-flare lines.</p><p>On a more casual note, there were cropped and narrow jeans and cuffed shorts. A strapless top made from floaty layers of organza nodded to current trends, as did the finale, a strapless, multilayered trapeze. In the end, though, the collection didn't quite make a persuasive case to be taken on a par with the brand's lucrative accessories. Underscoring the importance of the latter to this house, nearly every model came out with the glam oversize shades, stacks of bangles or chain-handle bags, and croc slingbacks.</p></div>"
59,spring,2007,s2007,gareth-pugh,"The cotton-covered runway suddenly inflated into a billowing river, and out stepped a latex-masked creature in humongous Lucite platforms and a full-skirted checkerboard dress. He, she, it (gender soon ceased to matter) was followed by yet more outrageous figures, their completely covered bodies and faces sprouting 3-D geometrical protrusions. Each was wearing some kind of coat made in bristling patchworks of black-and-white vinyl, survival-blanket silver foil, or plastic blown up with air.</p><p>Welcome to the insane world of Gareth Pugh, a young man capable of distorting the human body almost beyond recognition. Get sucked in for a moment, and you can believe you're watching characters from some monstrous sci-fi computer animation coming to life before your eyes. On that level—i.e., the level of mind-altering theatrics—what Pugh's up to is very well done. He gets it partly from his background as a costume designer (at the precocious age of 14) for the English National Youth Theatre, and partly from London's extreme club scene.</p><p>Backstage, this strange creative force turns out to be a soft-spoken boy who says he was inspired by watching Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy movie <em>Legend</em>, ""where Princess Lili dances in a white room and becomes her darker self."" Will there ever be clothes to wear here? Maybe one day. Rumors abound that Pugh may receive backing from that other dark-side designer, Rick Owens, with whom he once interned.</p></div>"
60,spring,2007,s2007,giambattista-valli,"When shopping for a trapeze dress next season, you could do worse than seek out Giambattista Valli. Of the many designers who latched onto this new-again shape, he did it with the most finesse. To his critics, there's an old-fashioned lack of serious daywear—the kind that a well-remunerated woman might sport to a board meeting—in Valli's runway shows. To his fans, however, the couturelike finish of his big-occasion clothes—which ranged from egg-shaped frocks to pannier dresses for spring—is beyond reproach.</p><p>Take, they might argue, the lifelike roses that decorated one short black dress. Inspired by the abstract expressionist Alberto Burri, Valli burned their edges, so that they rustled like fallen leaves as they glided down the runway. ""I wanted to portray an intellectual beauty,"" he said. And so, along those same lines, he requested permission from the Calder Foundation to reprint one of the artist's mobile paintings for an aptly airy bubble skirt that he paired with a collarless, belted jacket. And from art benefactress Peggy Guggenheim, he cribbed rococo sunglasses and pagoda hats.</p><p>The results skewed more precious than intellectual, but there was no quibbling with the beauty of Valli's mille-feuille organza meringues. If they will need a few extra inches added to their hems to make them red-carpet safe for the likes of Katie Holmes and Victoria Beckham, his front-row guests, that's a minor complaint and one easily solved by this technically accomplished designer.</p></div>"
61,spring,2007,s2007,gianfranco-ferre,"Sporty is not a concept you think of when you think of Gianfranco Ferré. Multilayered, embellished, and highly wrought are more like it. And so the nautical looks that opened his show had strayed about as far as they could from their casual roots. Stand-up-collar spencers in crisp gabardine topped trim shorts and striped athletic tanks embroidered with coats of arms. His take on the tracksuit—an off-the-shoulder top with a ribbed neckline and loose-fitting pants—came in navy crinkled silk. The show had more lace—as panels on zip-front leather shirts or trim on pleated cocktail dresses—than a Victoria's Secret store. To finish, he took us from the beaches of the Riviera to the dance halls of Spain—a good move, as it turned out. The septet of flamenco dresses weren't surefire crowd-pleasers; tassels don't usually go over with the fashion crowd. But somehow all those layers of polka dots, contrast stripes, lace, and ruffled and pleated voile and chiffon worked. If his trademark taste for excess seemed heavy-handed elsewhere, here it came off as surprisingly light.</p></div>"
62,spring,2007,s2007,giles-deacon,"The energy surging from young London fashion is affecting everyone in its radius, including, it would seem, a slightly older generation. Something certainly inspired Giles Deacon to up his game this season. His spring collection was definitively the best he's done.</p><p>Deacon has always aspired to a Parisian level of couture-like design, but the execution has tended to be a bit lumpy and clunky at times. This season, he delivered on all fronts, with a collection of chic sixties looks that had an underlying S&amp;M theme, madly accessorized with vast ostrich hats by Stephen Jones. If that sounds aggressive, it didn't stop Deacon producing a slew of beautiful dresses. One was a short trapeze of black lace overlaid on white; another was a gown in tiers of stiff fan pleats, trimmed with patent at the neck. Others were belled at the hip, or Empire-line in a slightly off-register print of dancing skeletons.</p><p>The bondage theme was worked out in the spiky stilettos, prints of whips and chains, and, most pointedly, in the squashy patent bags loaded with giant studs. They're the result of Deacon's collaboration with Mulberry, and among them was one of the wittiest little evening bags to be seen in a long time, made in the shape of a miniature mace. Bottom line: Thanks to his new level of accomplishment, Deacon has put clear water between himself and the next generation of beginner talent. And, in the meanwhile, those bags promise an excellent income stream he could surely do with.</p></div>"
63,spring,2007,s2007,giorgio-armani,"A few days after mounting his Emporio extravaganza in London, Giorgio Armani showed that he hadn't exhausted his bag of staging tricks. Approximately halfway through his signature line's presentation this afternoon, the lights dramatically dimmed and the white catwalk was covered by a glossy black one. But beneath the showmanship, there was a focused attention to detail here. What came before the scene change was Armani by day. Flowing pajama pants and narrow tea-length skirts in silk (the bottoms weren't really the point) were topped by one great-looking jacket after another. Some were fitted and single-breasted, others asymmetrical and cut away at the sides, and still more came slouchy and almost oversize. Scarves knotted restrictively across the upper arms almost obscured their lines, though nothing could detract from the freshest of his new toppers, which were cropped and boxy and had just a hint of the volume that's been seen on other runways.</p><p>The accessories, as is their wont on Armani's runway, threatened to get in the way of his eveningwear. But he quickly showed why he's still the go-to designer for after-dark elegance. The field may be more crowded now than when he began dressing the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster two decades ago, but the pioneer of the Milano-movieland connection remains a fount of persuasive options, from a pale pastel column suspended from a contrasting ribbon around the neck to a pair of strapless boned styles with minimalist bows. Saving the best for last, he closed with an allover-silver beaded gown. Sublimely simple in front, it came with a graphic, cutout back that will show off toned celebrity skin to the best advantage. Leonardo DiCaprio, sitting front-row, should rush to have it reserved for his Oscar date next March.</p></div>"
64,spring,2007,s2007,givenchy,"Riccardo Tisci returned today to the venue of his first Givenchy outing of a year ago. That show was roundly trounced by critics, but buyers found things to like in it, especially his beyond-the-ordinary white shirts. Last season's black dresses were also a hit, and increasing sales have given the young Italian confidence. ""I'm trying to do my own story,"" he said backstage.</p><p>For spring—his all-important third collection—that meant ethnic geometries, which were part of Givenchy's oeuvre, and fetish accents, which are Tisci's own. The elements of tribalism that surfaced in his July couture presentation appeared here as batik-style prints on draped and folded silk jerseys, patent-leather breastplates, and animal-like fringe on a long series of black dresses. The show's circular motif proved both decorative, in the form of cutouts below the neckline, and practical, as in the holes through which the ends of waist-cinching belts were looped. As for the dog collars, striped stockings, and strappy, hobbling footgear that accessorized all this—well, it made for provocative theater.</p><p>Was this another step in the right direction? One answer will come when the collection arrives in stores a few months from now. The things you'll likely see there are a double-breasted jacket with passementerie detailing, a white denim trench, and more of those black dresses, each one with a new bodice detail. But there are also several elements that you won't come across, like the dresses with arching cutouts that revealed the upper thigh or—say it isn't so—union suits. Tisci remains on the upward slope of his learning curve, and he still has some climbing to do.</p></div>"
65,spring,2007,s2007,gucci,"Frida Giannini decided to steer Gucci out of the seventies disco for spring, further away from the hot-and-sexy territory so emphatically occupied by Tom Ford. ""I've been thinking about the early sixties, and a few things from the archive,"" she said of a show that began with short black coats and dresses piped in purple, orange, and red and that was grounded with block-heeled flats. It's Gucci's 85th anniversary, and Giannini's thoughts had probably been set in motion by flicking through paparazzi photos of the leggy likes of Ursula Andress and Britt Ekland, shopping at the company's Rome branch. But in the end, what she put on the runway had more to do with her efforts to broaden the brand's accessibility to young women than with reciting the history.</p><p>The collection looked best when Giannini stuck to graphic shifts. Decorated with hexagons of silver beading on white, they were worn with cute silver space-age flats. A few long, patchwork-print Empire scarf dresses—a revisiting of an idea in her first resort collection—had a similarly unforced appeal. She also showed refabricated updates of the skinny pants, boxy jackets, and low-heeled Beatle boots that were a hit for spring. Ultimately, though, the pressure to show a variety of potential hot sellers made for a lack of coherence. A puzzling passage of folkloric, vaguely Tyrolean printed dresses in the middle seemed to have nothing much to do with the rest, nor did it make any connection to trends emerging elsewhere. Not to say these looks won't be nice for a girly vacation come next summer, but to put forward a stronger point of view, Giannini needs to learn what's for retail racks, and what makes a concise statement in a show.</p></div>"
66,spring,2007,s2007,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow returned to the London runway this season after a break to rethink his business strategy. He's always been a modernist with a theoretical bent and an intense interest in how science and technology intersect with clothing design, and he explored these same concerns for spring.</p><p>For starters, he named his show ""Seam Allowance,"" a technical reference to the fabric left over when garments are sewn together. If that flew over the heads of most in his audience, call us frivolous—what really matters to a woman is how things end up looking. In practice, his exercise in asymmetry produced exaggerated flaps and panels of fabric free-floating over the surfaces of fluid satin or chunkier washed gabardine.</p><p>Morrow also likes a bit of glitz, and in a nod to London's current Versace trend he added in the odd cardigan and skirt in sparkling crystal mesh, as well as pieces in bronze chain mail. But one of the main points of his techno-futurism—the water-repellent qualities of his charmeuse—remained invisible. The delicate fabric is treated with a form of nanotechnology that enables it to survive a downpour without a mark. However turned on Morrow is by that advance, it's a boy thing—like a fascination with what's under the hood of a car. Whether something looks slick and sexy are more pressing concerns for most women, and when Morrow cut a neat, puff-sleeved jacket or a killer pair of pants close to the body, his ideas gained traction.</p></div>"
67,spring,2007,s2007,hermes,"A boardwalk runway and canvas beach chairs in the house's signature orange set the mood for the Hermès show. First out was a series of maillots accented with the label's iconic studded leather belts, bracelets, and chokers, and alternatively covered up by a sharply-cut blazer, a soft, cropped hoodie, or a languid sarong.</p><p>What came after was a bit more of a muddle, first because it was seasonally off-the-mark and second because it didn't all convey the elegance long associated with the brand. Wispy chiffons in plaid or a more spring-like sunflower pattern were draped into bow-front blouses and floaty skirts or shirtgowns, over which were layered desirable small leather vests and shrunken jackets. Flora and fauna decorated lace and pleated silk evening dresses, respectively, the former accented with subtle Hermès logos on the straps. Also in the not-always-successful mix were three-piece leather shorts suits, satin safari jackets, suede wraps that crisscrossed in back to tie at the front, and a luxe take on the leisure suit, also in suede.</p><p>Last season, Gaultier made a convincing argument for fashion at Hermès with a chic collection that subtly referenced polo. Spring's beach frolic was less persuasive.</p></div>"
68,spring,2007,s2007,j-mendel,"How ironic is it that Gilles Mendel's spring shows have become his strong suit? J. Mendel is a fur house, after all. And yes, he still cuts a superluxe broadtail vest coat, this season in pale lilac. But it's his dreamy gowns, pintucked at the bodice and falling to the floor in soft waves of gently fraying dove gray, ice blue, or lemon meringue, that set the hearts of his front-row ladies aflutter. (No one more so than Dr. Lisa Airan, who will wear a gown of his design at her Tuscany wedding next week.)</p><p>You could even say that Mendel initiated the trend, in New York at least, for the romantic, petaled evening looks that are so prevalent on this week's runways. For spring, he was thinking more geometrically. Overlapping circles were a recurring motif on everything from a chocolate patent-leather coat to his new suit: a short-sleeve jacket with volume below the bust worn with a pleated, full skirt. And to drive home the point that he can do more than evening, he even tried his hand at denim. A stiff, midnight blue, it was sliced and chevroned like his furs, and oozed uptown cool.</p></div>"
69,spring,2007,s2007,jasmine-di-milo,"Talk about a brilliant idea. Invite people to your dad's Bois de Boulogne villa—not just any villa, actually, but the former home of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor—for a quick peek at your latest collection, followed by cocktails. The curiosity factor attracted editors and buyers who have long since sworn off 9:30 shows to designer Jasmine Al Fayed's otherwise modest presentation tonight. And when it came to her father Mohamed's sitting rooms, they weren't disappointed. Those were original portraits of Wallis Simpson on the walls. As for the young designer's clothes, they showed a marked improvement over last season's louche fare.</p><p>""Becoming a mother has lightened my mood,"" said the 25-year-old. In addition to the allover beaded number that Al Fayed herself donned, showing off a post-pregnancy body that other girls would kill for, there was an off-the-shoulder jersey number and a smoking, but with shorts. The focus, however, was day clothes: a baby doll, a shorts-and-puff-sleeve-blouse set, a shirtdress. None was lighter, though, than a shift with a wild mustang print.</p></div>"
70,spring,2007,s2007,jason-wu,"Although 23-year-old Jason Wu designs dolls as well as clothes (hip dolls, that is—recent efforts include RuPaul and Amanda Lepore figures), his spring show displayed a great deal of maturity, with its focus on tasteful eveningwear in white, blush, and black. Wu's take on the omnipresent trapeze was discriminating: One faille coatdress had a princess line, and a shantung jacket had a Watteau back. Hems were often asymmetrical. He picked up on the ballet theme seen elsewhere this spring with pale tulle Degas dresses, and he offered several variations on the must-have navy blue evening gown. With only two collections under his belt, this Parsons- and Narciso Rodriguez–trained designer is still toying with his aesthetic, but the major stores are starting to take notice, and it'll be interesting to see how he plays his next hand.</p></div>"
71,spring,2007,s2007,jean-paul-gaultier,"This is Jean Paul Gaultier's 30th anniversary year, and after Janet Jackson and other tardy celebs had finally taken their seats, he started a celebration that will continue at a big fête Saturday night by recapping his greatest hits. He began with a man's motorcycle jacket with ""76"" and the French flag painted on the back, breezed past the bustier dresses with cone-shaped busts that Madonna made famous, and finished with a trompe l'oeil sheath with just one built-in jacket lapel. Together, the 30-plus pieces—some of which looked broken-in, like his friends had just pulled them from their closets—showcased Gaultier's incomparable visual wit.</p><p>It's a gift he made liberal use of in the new clothes he showed for next spring. With Jane Fonda on the loudspeakers asking, ""Are you ready to work out?"" the curtains parted to reveal models sweating away on glittery gym machines. But his sport references went beyond jokey visors, wristbands, and tube socks with heels. Satin baseball jackets came in countless color variations, some with Japanese embroidery, others with ""30"" emblazoned on their backs, and yet more rendered in sequined mesh. For day, these might be paired with leggings striped at the side or shorts; for night, piping was replaced by seams of crystals and cutouts at the shoulders and back. Pushing the concept to the limit, he closed with a halter gown cut to reveal a bikini top underneath, veiled by a sheer warm-up jacket.</p><p>By the time his next big milestone rolls around, which pieces from this upbeat, item-y collection will make the cut? Sans the leggings, the baby dolls in acid brights have a shot. Overall, you couldn't help feeling that spring came out a trifle insubstantial compared to the history lesson in his archives. In true Gaultier style, though, it all looked like plenty of fun.</p></div>"
72,spring,2007,s2007,jenni-kayne,"With her new husband, Richard Ehrlich, watching from the front row, along with Mischa Barton and Jared Leto, L.A. up-and-comer Jenni Kayne sent out her most focused collection to date. It was long on short shorts, cardigans, and brief little dresses that don't work any place but the beach (and why should they?). There were also numerous chiffon camis with delicately twisted straps. For after dark, Kayne made belted caftans of the sort that pleasantly evoke Malibu evenings in the seventies—a decade she's not old enough to remember.</p><p>A true California girl, Kayne isn't afraid of prints—for spring she did an oversized floral that appeared on everything from ruched maillots to pleated gowns. She's also comfortable with color: The runway was a swirl of chartreuse, teal, navy, aubergine, and brown, as well as salmon, saffron, mustard, and black. It could all have been much too much, but it worked, as did Kayne's leathers. She showed trenches (cropped and knee-length), motorcycle jackets, and a cocoon coat with a pin-tucked hem—every piece was buttery soft, but tailored sharp as a blade, and each one was more covetable than the last.</p></div>"
73,spring,2007,s2007,jeremy-laing,"For his first-ever runway presentation, the Toronto-based, Preen- and Alexander McQueen-trained designer Jeremy Laing distilled ideas he's been working on since his ""petit début"" for Fall 2005. Back was the neon, the tailoring (boyfriend and Norfolk jackets), and the play with shape. Last season, Laing worked with deflated volumes using mostly menswear fabrics; for spring, he favored lighter materials, like silk, for a softer, more lyrical effect—a feeling that was reinforced by a live performance by Swedish folksinger Colin Bergh. The designer's use of layering was mostly successful, if sometimes overwrought, with lingerie-like straps darting in and out of tops and a plethora of crisscross backs. Knickers seemed a hard sell, but the dresses really sang.</p></div>"
74,spring,2007,s2007,jil-sander,"It was sharp, precise, and pinging with hard, bright color. An acid-yellow shirt with a short, navy duchesse satin skirt. A skinny-legged black pantsuit with a cropped, high-fastened, one-button jacket, showing a flash of emerald shirt at the neck. An inky-blue elliptical dress with a drape in the back.</p><p>""I wanted energy,"" Raf Simons said of a Jil Sander presentation that read as a mandate for sense and simplicity. ""And to show that the collection is not only for the needs of young women."" Among the dispiriting confusion of beige and junior disco-flash that has bogged down Milan, Simons took on challenges that other designers have been frantically avoiding: working on a pantsuit, coming up with strategies to modernize a dress, making clothes that just might apply to the life of a high-achieving woman.</p><p>To begin with, he did that by calibrating the millimeter of difference—in the sliver-width of lapel, or the placement and concealment of fastenings—that separates an innovative piece of tailoring from boring corporate uniform. Slim, fly-fronted coats and a multiplicity of short jackets, distinctively cut to stand slightly away from the body, achieved that. And if the ultra-narrow trouser isn't for everyone, he was careful to put in a reassuring wider option, too.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""58dgeo""></div></div><p>All of the above faithfully walked the line marked out by Jil Sander in the nineties, but Simons also broke new ground by acknowledging the rising cohort of women who have added dresses to their daily repertoire. His office-appropriate navy sleeveless sheath with a drape in the torso, shimmery fish-scale ombré sequin cocktail dress, and to-the-floor button-through shirtwaister—and many more—showed that he even had that part of the equation down.</p></div>"
75,spring,2007,s2007,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart's show began with a surprise: Danish male model Mathias Lauridsen. Yes, Stuart has launched a menswear line (named Stuart Curtis because it was created in conjunction with her husband, Ron Curtis). That wasn't the only trick the designer had up her sleeve in this collection. The women's clothes were built around corsetry, and while lingerie is a recurring theme for Stuart, this time around boning and structure replaced satiny, starlet-style pieces.</p><p>This was a move in the right direction, as it took the designer away from her overfamiliar vintage vibe (even if it's difficult to picture some of these sheer ensembles working outside of the bedroom). She also made good (though rather too much) use of the trapeze shape. Of particular note were a black lace number and a swingy pleated ivory lace look with a V-back and bows at the shoulders.</p></div>"
76,spring,2007,s2007,john-galliano,"After his restrained Dior presentation last Tuesday, you might've assumed that John Galliano would take the audience on one of his wild rides for the label that bears his name. It was something of a surprise, then, when the show opened with a section of white suits. With their hook-and-eye closures and hourglass lines, they looked like the sexpot sisters to their Dior counterparts, but they still seemed intended to send a message about the designer's facility with real clothes.</p><p>From that point on, deciphering Galliano's mindset became increasingly complicated. If Dior's eveningwear was calm, tonight's was pitched toward the garish. Liquid jersey in violet, blue, or fuchsia was spliced from hip to thigh with a cartoon-y flower print. Likewise, hand-painted gold chain-mail skirts descended from satiny asymmetric bodices. Softer and prettier were a series of nude chiffons edged with ruffles in a pale floral.</p><p>Next came the draped gowns: Splashed with bright sequins or appliquéd with ribbons of gold beads, each one was accessorized by a gargantuan hat. Some of these were fashioned to resemble a leaf or the bow on a birthday present, others to look like a man's fedora. It was hard, finally, to see them as much more than a gimmick.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""v3lsie""></div></div><p>All of this was set to a soundtrack of songs that referenced frustrated desires. Galliano's great talent has been proven again and again, but this season it seemed curiously fettered.</p></div>"
77,spring,2007,s2007,jonathan-saunders,"Jonathan Saunders took a convincing step forward this season. ""I didn't want to clutter a dress with print,"" he explained. Instead, he melded decoration into the structural design of his dresses. It made for softer, lighter, more graphically linear shapes, with the pattern worked into embroideries as well as printed zones. His starting point was a section of military braiding that he exaggerated and abstracted into knotted, curling surface patterns in cream-on-cream padded-satin embroidery. There were also subtle swirls and geometrics in gray, orange, and cornflower blue. Some of the shoulder-tab details and crystal embroideries, he said, were derived from armor, but the effects were anything but aggressive. Along the way, he came up with some clever devices, like layering a printed tabard over a fitted dress, or restricting pattern to just a belt. They gave the collection a sense of sophistication and delicacy that some of his previous more print-heavy clothes have lacked.</p></div>"
78,spring,2007,s2007,josh-goot,"You can take the boy out of Sydney, but you can't take Sydney out of the boy. Twenty-six-year-old fashion week newcomer Josh Goot has made a name for himself everywhere from London to Hong Kong designing cotton jersey separates with a laidback, sexy cool that is synonymous with his native Australia. By way of his New York introduction, he showed trenches, suits, racer-back tank dresses, and tube skirts in black, white, silver, gray, and lemon yellow. This made for a fun, though not flawless presentation.</p><p>For the most part, the clothes looked invitingly easy to wear: soft as can be, and when cut with a little give, as a zip hoodie minidress was, forgiving, too. Of course, many were designed to cling. Of those, two dresses made from arabesques of black and heather gray jersey were chicest. But to make it here, or more precisely on the runway, he'll have to develop a more pointed design message, and leave the primary colors down under.</p></div>"
79,spring,2007,s2007,jovovich-hawk,"When Carmen Hawk and Milla Jovovich began their line, some suspected it was a vanity project, but the new designers have been legitimized by a recent CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund nomination. Accordingly, throngs of editors and well-wishers jammed into the Adrian Ruehl Gallery in the Meatpacking District to see a tableau of models chatting casually in long, retro-styled dresses that were rendered in silk and jersey prints and finished with crochet or lace trim.</p><p>Jovovich and Hawk said they were trying to create a ""Sunday afternoon feeling"" with their collection, and they achieved it with pieces like a caftan banded and belted in bordeaux, as well as a shirred-front and ruffled halter gown, both nicely accessorized with vintage-looking hats. At the same time, the designers took the opportunity to introduce a ""specialty jean"" featuring a slightly higher waist and fuller legs than usual, with front pockets. But as the parade continued, touching on everything from Victorian white work to thirties glamour to disco dash, the inspirations came a little too thick and fast. The show, which featured a soundtrack of punk covers by Nouvelle Vague, hit some of the right notes, but Jovovich-Hawk haven't yet made the song their own.</p></div>"
80,spring,2007,s2007,junya-watanabe,"Striking up images of Beau Brummel and Beethoven, Junya Watanabe effectively cut off the urban uprising he broke out last season in mid-yell. All you needed to know was there in look one: a high-collared frothy ruffled shirt knotted in a cravat; cutaway tailcoat; narrow pants; and pointy, patent lace-ups. The formal, decorative, historicist look was a sharp change of mood, but not a volte-face. Watanabe regularly shifts between romance and punk, and the reason he doesn't look schizoid is that, funnily enough, the same elements always turn up either side of the divide.</p><p>Thus, Watanabe's signature tailcoats, nip-waist dandy jackets, lean boy-cut pants, and shirts were switched this season into baroque-splendid fabrics instead of ripped-up army fatigues. Or so it might have appeared. On close inspection, the first several looks were cut in denim, followed by narrow, vaguely fifties Teddy Boy drainpipes—a touch of street swagger to undercut the poshness, and a flash of Watanabe's jean genius. After that, he moved the collection on up into baroque printed paisleys, as well as beige chino-gabardines appliquéd with white lace, and tuxedo pants. He worked the thought through into full-length shirtdresses in tucked lawn or lace—and a final skirt that exited in a flourish of cotton shirt ruffles rippling into a train. Masculine but feminine, romantic but modern, smart but wearable—it was all that, but the most difficult contradiction the accomplished Watanabe pulled off was that this collection looked new, yet totally identifiable as his own.</p></div>"
81,spring,2007,s2007,kai-kuhne,"Since separating from As Four two seasons ago, Kai Kühne has been struggling to forge his own identity. But today the designer showed a confident spring collection to an audience that included major retailers. Using a construction technique he dubbed ""German origami,¿ Kühne found new ways to fold and shape fabrics into voluminous but wearable shapes, including a white blouson/bubble shirtdress look. Some of the designer's experiments with larger silhouettes, such as jackets with pendant pockets, were off the mark, but reimagined classics, like camisole tops and sweater dresses, were effective. So too were the draped pieces, including a T-shirt dress with a back slit. And Kühne's finale dress, a shimmering, ingeniously draped column of liquid silk worn by Darla Baker, showed a real individual stamp.</p></div>"
82,spring,2007,s2007,karen-walker,"After eight seasons in London, well-traveled New Zealander Karen Walker is ready for new frontiers. The UK capital's loss was New York's gain as she showed a spring collection that was long on the skewed charm that's her signature. She claimed inspiration from Land Girls (the women who worked the farms in England while their menfolk were away at the front during World War II) and there were discernible echoes of the forties in the floral prints, puff sleeves and baggy pants. But Walker's real focus, as always, was on the hybrid of female and male. It's that fashion clich¿ about the woman who slips into her boyfriend's clothes in the morning, except in Walker's capable hands, it feels fresh and slightly subversive.</p><p>In this collection, for instance, floral bloomers were worn with a pinstriped waistcoat, an organza dress was topped by a net T-shirt, and neon nylon parkas added a mod boy element. The look is sexy with a coolly ambiguous twist, and it's easy to see why Walker has galvanized a stellar clientele of young Hollywoodites. If the show occasionally played like Karen's Greatest Bits for people who know about her, it was a smart way to introduce her work to those who don't.</p></div>"
83,spring,2007,s2007,karl-lagerfeld,"What a difference a continent makes. Karl Lagerfeld traded in New York for Paris and goth for chic. His cleaned-up and pared-down signature collection was full of the kind of clothes that get fashion editors scribbling, not because they will make pretty pictures—although there's plenty of potential for lovely editorial pages in his paneled-chiffon evening numbers, accessorized here with lace stockings and fingerless gloves—but rather because they'll make such pretty additions to their closets.</p><p>Rendered in colors he's long since made his own at Chanel (i.e., black, white, and navy), Lagerfeld's day dresses were short, with drop waists and sharp pleats, or fluid and draped in soft jersey. Patent belts accented a trench dress, a shorts suit, and a shirtdress with flaring A-line skirt. But it wasn't all girly. There were precise, slim shirts—all high, stiff collars and built-in ties—and shiny boy pants or skinny jeans, the not-so-inside joke being that they were borrowed from Lagerfeld's own closet.</p></div>"
84,spring,2007,s2007,l-a-m-b-,"Is Gwen Stefani the Tory Burch of the downtown crowd? Both hired the MisShapes to deejay their presentations, and both presented heaps of cool items that their fans will want to snap up come spring. Dressed in a long, languid black gown with trademark leopard print at the sleeves, Stefani talked about her touchstones for spring, chief among them being Michelle Pfeiffer in <em>Scarface</em>. That explained all the blond-wigged models. Jamaican Rude Boy attitude and ""global-inspired"" prints, referencing Guatemalan, Indian, and Japanese textiles, rounded out the list and kept things from getting too high-concept, though. Tracksuits (one had a side stripe that read, ""Are you L.A.M.B. enough?"") were surefire hits, as always, but the long evening looks were attractive, too. A new line of bags—some ladylike in blue and white, others with a red, yellow, and green ombré pattern—and footwear—from ""disco"" shoes to L.A.M.B.-emblazoned boots—accessorized the show. Overall, Stefani's spring line (developed with Zaldy Goco), was kicking.</p></div>"
85,spring,2007,s2007,la-perla,"Some in the States might be surprised to learn that La Perla has a ready-to-wear collection, but judging by the Italian TV personalities in the front row today, the brand's reach in its home country now extends beyond the lingerie drawer. That doesn't mean that the collection ignored its roots. On the contrary, it took a handful of spring trends—eyelet, pale neutrals, miniature florals—and sexed them up with touches of lace and generous helpings of bare skin.</p><p>Things began innocently enough. Co-opting Catherine Deneuve in <em>Belle de Jour</em> as a muse, the show started off with a demure white dress cinched by a black bow—a recurring motif, it would become apparent—and a belted trench with a hem that was lasercut into a floral pattern. The collection quickly moved into vixenish territory, however, with above-the-knee cocktail numbers with bra-cup bodices and (slightly less suggestive) asymmetric, one-shoulder styles. The de rigueur swimsuits were tastefully done in bandeau tops and retro navel-grazing briefs. All in all, it was well executed, but La Perla's ready-to-wear still has a lot of growing to do before it establishes a persuasive identity beyond the boudoir.</p></div>"
86,spring,2007,s2007,lanvin,"Lanvin closed the spring collections with the strongest marshaling of purposefully honed modernity Alber Elbaz has ever sent down a runway. Ditching the surreal, fifties-flavored illusionism of his last collection, this was a personal departure, with the emphasis on linear pantsuits, high-tech gleam, and real-world usage over his more familiar fuzzy-focus romanticism. More than that, Elbaz's highly specific version of futurism (or, rather, looking at things as they are, right now) seemed like a comment on the corporate-versus-creative conflicts that have been scattering fashion all over the place this spring. ""When you're stuck, you go romantic,"" is how the designer put it. ""With freedom of spirit, you can go further. I wanted to touch technology, engineering, silicone, nylon, metal, and plastic. And a new place for the pragmatic.""</p><p>Elbaz works for a relatively small, privately owned label (thus the ""freedom"") but has a disproportionately large influence in driving fashion one way or the other. So when Lanvin shoots for a tougher, shinier, more high-powered vision of womanhood, it's a point of view that will be taken in parallel with the ideas from that other small-but-roaring powerhouse, Balenciaga. In Elbaz's hands, it wasn't so Robo-woman; more a matter of a dozen workings of futuristic Greek draping with athletic multistrap racer backs, along with leather or metallic skinny pantsuits with a flying-uniform edge, and parachute silk zipper-detailed shifts and trenches in acid yellow, pink, or pale khaki.</p><p>Still, the real difference here was that—apart from a couple of too-literal, spacey moments—Elbaz didn't project his woman fully into a brave new world. He is one of the few designers who seem to remember that we are still earthlings who serve in offices and quite like (once past 25) to get out at night in something other than a baby doll. This collection, with its lean tailoring and its plethora of crunched silk or slithery, form-skimming silk or charmeuse-draped dresses, made either reality look like a pleasurable proposition.</p></div>"
87,spring,2007,s2007,lela-rose,"After a couple of seasons off the runway, Texan Lela Rose returned with a spring collection that she said was designed for steel magnolias: ""women with an ethereal quality who are powerful, too."" Most of the pieces—tent dresses; tiered pinafores; a lantern coat; full, short skirts topped by blouses with bell sleeves, all in watercolor pastels, silver, and ivory—belong in the first camp. But there was an oddly charming white gown with ruffles down the back that looked like what you'd get if an angel and a stegosaurus got together to make babies.</p><p>Ten weeks shy of giving birth to her second child, Rose focused on the loose volumes that are shaping up to be a strong spring trend, adding her favorite girly touches. Large crystals dotted grosgrain belts, bands of silver basket weave decorated the hem of a white faille dress, and rose florets bloomed at the neckline of a sleeveless shift. There wasn't a hard edge in the house, nor has Rose radically altered her aesthetic during her absence from the catwalk, but that suits her well-connected customers and front-row pals just fine.</p></div>"
88,spring,2007,s2007,loewe,"With scrubbed faces and hair held back by rolled and knotted white scarves, the models at Loewe looked fresh from a day at the Eden Roc spa. That impression was backed up by Spanish designer José Enrique Oña Selfa's concentration on timely, short silhouettes—tunics, sack dresses, wraps—and further locked in by the details. The show's colorful silk floral prints, for instance, were trimmed with thick white piping that put one in mind of terrycloth robes.</p><p>Loewe began 160 years ago as a Madrid saddlery, and making sense of the house signature in a spring collection isn't necessarily an easy proposition. Oña Selfa didn't offer any definitive solutions, but working that same flower motif, he finessed the challenge, embroidering super-lightweight suede with silver thread or appliquéing foil-thin silver patent onto a halter dress and a coat. If his dresses got tricky with their cowl necks and double-belts, or tangles of yarn-like fringe, his leathers never did.</p></div>"
89,spring,2007,s2007,louis-vuitton,"Dark clouds swirled ominously on a video backdrop. Then, in a defiant bid to shoot a ray of light into gloomy times, Marc Jacobs sent out his romantic-cum-sporty, casual-but-pretty Vuitton collection—motivated, he said, by his championing of ""beauty, despite everything."" A mattress-ticking anorak, over cropped white cotton drill pants and a funny cheap checked shopping bag that carried a big, passport-style Louis Vuitton stamp, set the mood. As usual, though, this collection was a complex refraction of the many inspirational sparks that go into the work here: pieces synthesized to project the simultaneous multinational appeal this brand must maintain.</p><p>As it developed, the show patched in elements of Victoriana (corseted leg-of-mutton-sleeve jackets, cotton-muslin underpinnings) against oxford-blue men's shirting, sprigged Liberty-style prints, balletic tulle petticoats, and washed-out khaki parachute silks. Add the detail of puffy pockets, drawstring ruching, tape ties, and suspended shapes, and you have the laundry list, though not the complete essence of it. The X-factor is the Asia-facing appeal in all this prettiness. Jacobs and his team were in Tokyo for a Vuitton show last May, and while they were at it, they looked at the streets and took in some shopping at one of Japan's specialist <em>figua</em> stores, which sell hyper-lifelike child dolls clothed in complete wardrobes of faerie frills and flounces.</p><p>That reading delighted the junior Japanese fashion editors in the audience, who, like the girls back home, kill for the <em>kawaii</em> (trans.: cute) aesthetic Jacobs consistently fields so well at Vuitton. To Western audiences, meanwhile, the faded, watered-tea-to-dusty-rose tints and the hint of Meissen milkmaid skewed more <em>Marie Antoinette</em> aftermath. No disagreements, though. It was young and refreshing, and the multilingual signage in the bags and the shape of hollowed-out shoe heels flashed out loud and clear. ""LV-OE,"" it read.</p></div>"
90,spring,2007,s2007,luca-luca,"""This is the most avant-garde collection we've done in terms of silhouette,"" explained Luca Orlandi before his spring show. The designer has just moved out of a brownstone atelier into stark new headquarters, and he carried the concept of minimalism into his clothes, which were mostly rendered in neat volumes and graphic white and black. Orlandi seemed to be designing for a younger, hipper customer, the kind who is apt to layer strapless dresses over tanks, which is how he presented them today. Label loyalists looking for important evening looks will be disappointed, but you can't fault the man for trying to stretch his wings. It didn't always work—his take on the omnipresent trapeze, a snug Empire married to a fuller skirt, quickly became an overly repetitive trope—but pieces like the sporty linen-and-rayon raincoat that opened the show felt fresh.</p></div>"
91,spring,2007,s2007,luella,"What's black and white and read all over? The first look from Luella Bartley's lively yet focused spring show: an alphabet Jacquard trouser suit cut sharp and lean with matching shoes. After sampling from rockabilly last season and the yacht club set before that, Bartley's gone mod and, in a surprise move for a designer who helped invent the charm-laden handbag, almost minimal. There were sexy second-skin jeans, striped tees to layer under cardigans or zip-front jackets, and silver macs on her Sony Music Studios runway, along with patent leather winkle pickers and graphic plastic shades.</p><p>But no matter where her inspiration leads, Bartley can always be counted on for a cheeky party dress and a proper preppy sweater and button-down set. This season, the former came embellished with pieces of shattered mirror stitched into the letter B. Freja Beha closed the show in a pink lamé lampshade skirt and a T-shirt that spelled G-E-E-K. Try as she might, though, Bartley—and the clothes she makes—will never be anything but cool.</p></div>"
92,spring,2007,s2007,luisa-beccaria,"There is a hard-to-miss Omega watch ad near the Four Seasons in Milan, featuring Nicole Kidman in a Luisa Beccaria dress. And before today's show, the designer's PR representative was quick to mention a fan letter the actress had sent, raving about the lovely, frothy confection. What's behind Beccaria's loyal and growing Hollywood following? ""She makes them pretty,"" remarked one editor. ""Her clothes don't scare them.""</p><p>Does that mean she plays it too safe? Certainly, there was nothing demonstrably trendy on Beccaria's spring runway, and when she did nod in that direction—with a couple of short, strapless party frocks in washed silk —it didn't quite gel. Their bubble hems seemed out of place among the more demure knee-length offerings in eyelet, scalloped lace, and hazy watercolor florals. But when she stayed closer to her comfort zone, her clothes stood out for all the right reasons—take a shirtwaist dress with cap sleeves in organza printed with an abstract gold wash. The collection's lone suit, a cape-back jacket and a pleated skirt, came in the same Klimt-esque fabric. The showstopper arrived a few looks later, a champagne silk-charmeuse gown worthy of Carole Lombard. Bias-cut thirties styles have been gliding down many a runway, but Beccaria's looked the most elegant and the best-constructed of the lot. If she only does one thing, there's no denying she does it awfully well.</p></div>"
93,spring,2007,s2007,maison-martin-margiela,"Martin Margiela's best-kept secret—apart from his Mr. Invisible image—is that he is one of the finest tailors and cutters working today. Reading between the lines, that part of his message was meant to be played up a bit more for spring. Caped silhouettes, sharp jackets, high-waisted pants, sexily original jersey dresses—all these things are regularly available in stores, but come show time, it's usually the high-concept experimentalism (like last season's clothes made out of furnishings) that gets the airplay. This time, he toned it down—apart, that is, from the distraction of linebacker padded shoulders, nude body stockings, and that top-ten most woman-annoying garment, the one-legged trouser-skirt.</p><p>It's fair to say, too, that there was an Americana stars-and-stripes theme worked into the show, though nothing that amounted to a dominating intellectual thrust. Instead, in the course of an unusually straight-up runway presentation, aficionados could pick off the wearables in plain view. They were sensuous cape T-shirts over tailored pants; jersey dresses, cleverly engineered from concentrically striped target-circles to flow and drape every which way; and precision-cut variations on men's-for-women tailoring. Plastic and Lucite wedges, a necklace strung together from aviator sunglass lenses, and a huge black shiny star cummerbund kept the nutty-cool edge, but mainly this show seemed to be focused on lifting Margiela out of the marginal.</p></div>"
94,spring,2007,s2007,malo,"In July, Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi—whose 6267 line won the Franca Sozzani–headed Who Is on Next? young designer award—were handed the reins of Malo¿s ready-to-wear line. And while the duo does favor body-hugging, sometimes retro silhouettes in their own work, for Malo they wanted to play with ideas of modernity. This took two forms in a repetitive collection: colorful, pop-y, occasionally overwhelming prints; and a space-age feeling that nodded to Courrèges. The designers treated cashmere with plastic via coatings, and they embroidered large plastic stones onto everything from a modish sequined tunic to bags. Applying the 3-D lozenges to a pair of micro shorts was not their most practical idea. Among the long parade of trapeze shapes and frequent doses of color, a white cashmere suit and a patent trench really caught the eye. Aquilano and Rimondi are clearly trying to make a mark, but let's hope they don't forget the essentials—like the cozy luxe of cashmere—in the rush to modernize.</p></div>"
95,spring,2007,s2007,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"A short patchwork dress of hippie prints with glam paillettes at the shoulders appeared halfway through the Marc by Marc Jacobs show, and it was the perfect symbol for this collection, i.e. it had a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Jacobs worked all the season's angles: a few sixties shifts, all-American chinos in muddy hues, short A-line skirts. He even tossed in a leopard-print look that could've walked off last season's Marc Jacobs runway. Then there were the items that have made this line such a huge success, from innovative denim to great outerwear.</p><p>He also focused on the twenties silhouette that featured in his resort collection. Drop-waist dresses in everything from printed silk to striped knits were one motif that emerged from the layers of textures, patterns, and colors. A collection like this doesn't need a strong message, it needs great items, and there were plenty here. Still, it left you wishing for a little of the focus and intensity he brings to his main line.</p></div>"
96,spring,2007,s2007,marc-jacobs,"Pachelbel's Canon, even Brian Eno's version, isn't the sort of music you expect at a runway show. And a bucolic backdrop of rolling hills behind a catwalk that, in turn, was painted lawn green and elevated over a river of mint candies isn't the kind of setting you see every day of fashion week, either. But Marc Jacobs has such a surfeit of cool, he got away with both—and then some—at a spring show that was strangely beautiful (as ever), if a little esoteric.</p><p>Backstage, he was mum on literal inspirations, speaking instead of ""light, kindness, peace, and generosity."" The light part made a sort of sense. Jacobs' palette consisted of white, cream, black for contrast, and ombréd grays, with flashes of brilliant holographic sequins. And from a shirred tulle bomber jacket with a furlike appearance to a drop-waist tiered lace dress that evoked Poiret, there was a certain romance to the collection. Layered jersey tees, billowing brushstroke-stripe silk dresses, and deconstructed <em>à la japonaise</em> cashmeres had an appealing softness.</p><p>But was there substance beneath the whimsy? Many of these clothes—the <em>Arabian Nights</em> harem pants, for example, or the tulip pants that he showed unbuttoned up the side—will be a hard sell. On the other hand, the trio of understated-by-comparison T-shirt dresses and the bags—metallic leathers and exotic skins studded with crystals as big as the bulbs on an old Times Square marquee—should keep the faithful happy. Those items are the grounding forces that allow Jacobs to indulge his flights of fancy.</p></div>"
97,spring,2007,s2007,marchesa,"Marchesa's Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig first came to the fashion world's attention dressing starlets for the red carpet. For spring, their first time on the runway, the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists opened with a handful of short, paparazzi-friendly numbers abloom with floral details. Mischa Barton, sitting in the front row, oohed and aahed over a strapless black chiffon dress, the many folds of which resembled a rose, and Margherita Missoni said she had her eye on the lime-green tulle, which featured tiny blossoms across the bust.</p><p>Given the attention to detail in those flowers (they appeared in one form or another on each of the 26 pieces in this evening collection), it was surprising to note that hems were sometimes unfinished and a few seams left undone—lapses that are hard to overlook at these price points. Still, the palette—white, black, and hot pink—and all those roses were perfectly in keeping with spring's romantic mood.</p></div>"
98,spring,2007,s2007,marios-schwab,"Out of all the exuberant young talents in London, Marios Schwab is the one bringing restraint and rigorous cutting skills to fashion's we-love-the-nineties party. Having carved out an advanced statement about curvy, corseted, Alaïa-inspired dressing in two seasons of mini shows with the Fashion East collective, this Greek-Austrian designer is now thinking about where it all goes next. ""Instead of doing this body-tight thing everyone's talking about,"" he said, ""I wanted to manipulate curves in a different way.""</p><p>He worked that out partly with math, piecing hexagonal patchworks into subtly faceted, slightly standaway surfaces on his signature bra-top dresses. From there, he experimented with light layers of print floating over a contrasting underdress, and, less successfully, a section of power-mesh draping. One of Schwab's underlying interests, as befits the son of a bra-factory engineer, is the superstructure of lingerie, and it reappeared in the boned bustle detail protruding from a bandanna-print gown. In a move toward unfussy romanticism and lightness, he also showed a couple of faded rose-print dresses, neat to the waist, but with sculptural, airy volume in back.</p><p>Many of these were quietly outstanding pieces extraordinary to see coming from the hand of someone so young. It was still his first solo show, though, and in some ways, his anxiety to prove his worthiness led him to overextend himself. He needn't have made quite so many dresses; after the first few, the audience was sold, but before long, ready to leave. The show, through no fault of Schwab's, ran an unacceptable two hours late because of delays caused by other designers.</p></div>"
99,spring,2007,s2007,marni,"The test of a designer's true popularity is the number of industry professionals who turn up to her show wearing her clothes, and by 10 a.m., as the audience assembled in Consuelo Castiglioni's edge-to-edge coats, egg-shaped dresses, quirky sweaters, and clumpy heels, the gathering looked like a Marni convention. They got what they came for: a collection of simple-seeming but ingeniously cut pieces, sharpened with a new dash of sportiness and accented with shots of bright patent to modernize the neutrals of spring.</p><p>Castiglioni worked on the tough-to-wear difficulties inherent in the concepts of ""volume"" and graphic tunic-dressing that surfaced in last winter's round of collections. Her to-the-knee tunics were pulled in at the front with a threaded-through chunky belt that then left the back to float free. Under that, she put cropped sport-leggings and high, patent-leather, wood-block clogs.</p><p>Marni's signature dropped-shoulder looks and circular cuts were made up in light, papery, waffled, and coated fabrics in shades of white, stone, slate gray, and plaster, and there was a re-introduction of prints—some commissioned from the artist Richard Prince. The negative here was a slackness in the edit, and to non-converts, much of it came over as predictable. Still, the faithful left happy and—as is customary with Castiglioni— the news from her show (this season it's going to be the breezy anoraks and sporty pieces) will carry far. Afterward, asked how she feels about being so widely copied, she smiled: ""It's a bit not nice. But in a way, it's a compliment.""</p></div>"
100,spring,2007,s2007,martin-grant,"Martin Grant's clothes have always been about the dream of French chic. The trench. The little black dress. The jumpsuit? Like others this season, the Australian-born designer has injected a sportif element into his collection. It appeared in silhouettes (a snap-front jacket with hood), materials (a tent gown in sweatshirt-gray jersey), and details (contrast piping on a set of 1920s tennis dresses).</p><p>Where were the coats and suits that have made Grant's Marais studio a must-shop for devotees including Lee Radziwill, who looked the picture of elegance in his front row? A flawless raincoat in the palest gray near the beginning boded well. Unfortunately, though, this was followed by dresses that were surprisingly offhand (read: sloppy) for such a meticulous <em>tailleur</em>, the worst offender being a lime-green cowlneck jersey number. A plainer T-shirt dress cut from the same fabric but in heather-gray worked better.</p><p>For all that, Grant turned out some fine evening dresses, especially the final look, a red gown with a fishtail train and a bodice folded, pleated, and pressed with the assiduous attention to every detail for which the designer is known.</p></div>"
101,spring,2007,s2007,matthew-williamson,"Party clothes are Matthew Williamson's specialty. But last season, after landing the Emilio Pucci gig, he practiced unfamiliar restraint on his own runway in an effort to separate the two labels. Today, the pendulum swung back, way back. Williamson showed a wildly over-the-top collection for a girl on permanent vacation in Ibiza. Colors were psychedelic, prints were loud, and mirrored sequins glinted. The opening look—coral short shorts and a chambray chemise heavily embroidered with wood and plastic beads—had a bit of the relaxed boho vibe he once favored, but from there he went all-out glam with fluoro brights and kaleidoscopic digital prints on smock dresses, sweater vests, and a bathing suit.</p><p>In the right time and place—i.e. at 4 a.m. on the dance floor at Pacha—some of it could work, the lily pad-print sleeveless minidress, for example. But at 4 o'clock in the afternoon in a West Side ferry terminal quite a few of these pieces looked garish. And there's probably never a right time for the embroidered and studded Mexican peasant top he sent down the runway with floral leggings.</p></div>"
102,spring,2007,s2007,maurizio-pecoraro,"Was Maurizio Pecoraro's spring show a case of trickle-down cross-seepage, or just plain déjà-vu? Anyone who had already studied Marc Jacobs' show—i.e., everyone with an eye on the latest news—would have clocked a certain similarity between Pecoraro's curvy runway on stilts and something MJ had built just a couple of weeks ago. As for the clothes that were shown on it, they rang bells, too: some originally pealed by Marni, others by Prada, with the top notes layered on by Jacobs himself.</p><p>Marc-meets-Marni is an accurate enough reading of where the light-and-layered, beige-and-linen trend is going this season. And Pecoraro's pieces—brown cotton raised-waist smocks over dresses over leggings, sometimes topped with linen swing dusters—captured all that. Some of these, finished with hand-tucked bodices and vintage-looking lace, even had a personal feel. Too often, though, the overreferential styling and presentation ended up drowning out any individuality he might have to offer.</p></div>"
103,spring,2007,s2007,max-azria,"Max Azria Collection, the niche line in the billion-dollar BCBG empire, is meant to be a place where the company's creative forces can ""let their artistic voices be heard."" But it's not yet entirely clear what they're trying to say. The clothes often rely on origami-style construction, which lends them a vaguely Japanese feeling. Concept and wearability were well balanced in pieces like an ivory linen organdy dress with a ruffled V-back, and a blue faille number with a slight asymmetry, but it's difficult to imagine the young and pretty luminaries in the front row—Paris and Nicky Hilton, Eva Mendes, Sarah Michelle Gellar—going in for the ""undone"" aesthetic, however cleverly it's configured.</p></div>"
104,spring,2007,s2007,max-mara,"MaxMara's designers continued in the youthful direction established last season with a collection that touched on many of the current trends. Playing off the brand¿s strength as a coat business, they showed numerous variations on that Milan phenomenon (even for spring): the sporty, chic anorak. Here, it came cropped at the waist with a bubble skirt; as a dress with drawstring detailing; even shrunken into a bolero. Jackets were cut on the boxy side, in neoprene or with a blouson back, and were worn with tulip skirts with tucked hems for an easy new take on the suit. As on other catwalks, there were subtle tribal motifs, including patterned beading on shoulder straps. And here, the season's essential sack dress came in painterly abstract-floral silks.</p><p>The last part of the show could've used a sharper edit—how many ways can you drape, tuck, and wrap a metallic frock? Evening sarongs with oversize crystal straps managed to strike the right dressed-up-but-not-trying-too-hard note, but sweaters and pod-shaped skirts made from what looked like synthetic gorilla fur and a rubber floor mat were inexplicable—especially when the designers got so much else right.</p></div>"
105,spring,2007,s2007,michael-kors-collection,"With Justin Timberlake promising to ""bring sexy back"" on the soundtrack, Michael Kors turned out a collection that was one long riff on a dancer's body-loving wardrobe. His palette was nude, black, and tutu pink, with flashes of metallics, and his materials—which he layered on his models as if they were ballerinas on their way to the studio—ran from fine stretch wools to jazzy matte jerseys to chunkier knits. With all the leggings and crimped updos and even an off-the-shoulder <em>Flashdance</em> sweater or two, Kors was having a real eighties moment. It was fun while it lasted, but somehow out of step with his usual polished sense of chic. After several days of tent and trapeze looks, the waist came into sharp focus here. Kors cinched wide patent and python belts atop everything from maillots to evening dresses. Sequins, meanwhile, provided a Bob Fosse touch. Was it a coincidence that <em>Chicago</em> star Usher was in the audience? Or that across from him was one of the musical's alums, Bebe Neuwirth—in fishnets, no less? The collection's retro-sexy, look-at-me glitz should play big with the designer's new and huge <em>Project Runway</em> fan base. Still, you wanted a few more of the Kors-luxe knits, great tailored jackets, and sleek evening numbers he's best known for.</p></div>"
106,spring,2007,s2007,michon-schur,"Yes, that was Kirsten Dunst, one of Hollywood¿s hottest properties, sitting quietly at her pal Stephanie Schur¿s first runway show with not a paparazzo in sight. The under-the-radar L.A. label, Michon Schur, is just a few seasons old, but give the girl time and she¿ll have a front row full of starlets. Her subtle, self-assured spring collection offered plenty for a young red-carpet regular to like, from a brief A-line shift with this season¿s lantern sleeves to an easy, floor-length silk Jacquard dress in the color of the moment, navy. Both were shown with flat sandals—Schur knows firsthand about left-coast casual. Though a white shirtgown did veer toward dowdy, it was easily forgotten among chicer options like a ruffle-shouldered sheath that dipped low in the back and a one-shoulder number with a flippy skirt. Here's guessing we¿ll see one of these during Dunst's <em>Marie Antoinette</em> junkets.</p></div>"
107,spring,2007,s2007,missoni,"Hopping aboard Milan's space-age sixties trend might've been tempting for Angela Missoni. After all, this brand was born in that era. Instead, just as her parents did then, she's going her own way. Short shifts in fashion? Missoni put long pants with a slight flare on her runway—and not in a silvery brocade, or any of the other stiff fabrics that've been charging around town. Hers came in the house's signature crochet swirls. Shown with Missoni's contemporary take on the twinset—a slouchy V-neck sweater with a knit band atop it to give definition to the waist—the overall effect was one of softness and controlled ease. By contrast, the opening skirt, with large cargo pockets on the thighs, was a complete mystery: Few women could pull off a look that added such bulk to their frame, and even if they could, it's doubtful they'd want to.</p><p>Overcoming missteps like those, Missoni made the show memorable with her innovative prints. She turned tough, masculine camouflage into something feminine, using bright colors rather than drab ones and layering a water lily motif over them. At the opposite end of the spectrum was a microprint of soft dots on washed-out lavender and earth tones; this looked particularly good as fishtail flutters along the sides of a knee-length skirt. There were crystal-encrusted evening looks, but the newness came from something less predictable. The last outfit was a V-neck shell worn with a long column of a skirt, the latter slightly bubbled above optical chain embroidery encircling the legs. How refreshing to see a designer reinterpreting and updating her own vocabulary, rather than grasping at flighty notions of retro futurism.</p></div>"
108,spring,2007,s2007,miu-miu,"Closing Paris fashion week in suitably grand style, Miuccia Prada presented her Miu Miu show at a private mansion at 34 Avenue Foch that dates to 1854 and is decorated in Louis XVI style. But it wasn't the nineteenth or eighteenth century she had on her mind when she began thinking about spring. Rather, she was considering Russian constructivism, as well as the elegance of an elongated line.</p><p>That meant duchesse satin shirts and tunics color blocked in shades of navy, black, and wine, worn with high-waisted tapering pants. Dresses with touches of Africa (tribal prints) and Japan (origami-like folds of shiny fabric decorating the shoulder or hip) fell below the knee. But unlike the body-limning sheaths at Prada, with which this collection seemed to share a spirit, these—while narrow—were A-line. Shorter dresses, some in ribbed knits, came with drop waists pleated to mid-thigh.</p><p>The motif that held these all together was a tiny rounded collar. And there was more action at the neckline in the form of halter straps from which triangular and circular shapes were suspended to create graphic tops. What Prada offered with this sharp, 30-piece collection was a rebuke to the baby-doll dresses that have dominated the runways this season, and for that, praise is in order. It won't be a surprise when her high waists and slim shapes start appearing in the collections of her designer admirers.</p></div>"
109,spring,2007,s2007,monique-lhuillier,"Monique Lhuillier played it safe for spring, in a collection that reprised many of her past designs. Neat, jabot-fronted cocktail dresses reappeared, as did illusion necklaces—a familiar trope. The designer's exploration of color was more promising; her palette of forest green, bordeaux, and black orchid was an interesting choice in a season of flowery pastels. Lhuillier also experimented with fabrics, using unexpected materials like roughly textured linen raffia for evening wear. Loyalists will certainly be able to make a wish list from this collection—which included many pretty and appropriate gowns—but overall, spring found Lhuillier stuck in a repetitive rather than innovative mood.</p></div>"
110,spring,2007,s2007,moschino,"The Moschino show had all the trappings of late-fifties womanhood: the gloves, the bouffant hairdos, the crinolines under the skirts. And suspended at the back of the runway were giant spools of thread, skeins of yarn, and buttons aplenty. But the gals Rosella Jardini designs for aren't the type to sit alone at home on a Saturday night and darn socks. Whether on a hot date or solo, they're ready for the dance floor, here in a strapless black dress that blossomed out below the waist, or a shorter shift sprayed with crystals to catch the light. Tailored pieces, like trenches and curving boleros—along with leggings, some in gold Lurex—gave evening numbers a cool, rockabilly edge.</p><p>If these clothes sometimes lack the finesse that you expect from a designer-priced collection, Jardini made up for it with plenty of the spirit the label's known for. She overstitched a white, swingy jacket with black embroidery; laced a rope belt through the oversize grommets of a sailor suit; and, less compellingly, put crocheted sleeves on a coat. She still loves a visual trick, too: A couple of short-sleeve blouses came with long sleeves tied at the chest, mimicking the arms of a sweater tossed smartly over the shoulders. There were floral prints, graphic bull's-eye dots, and plenty of the brand's signature red, including one special bag made from molded plastic in the shape of a heart that neatly summed up the collection's tough yet sweet, and hard-to-dislike, message.</p></div>"
111,spring,2007,s2007,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez will always be a minimalist at heart. Even when he does embellishments, he can't help but do them in a streamlined way. Still, there was as much adornment as you're likely to see on a Rodriguez runway here. A pin that clasped a draped white dress at the hips resembled a polished stone. A short, gray cocktail dress was embroidered with red and black paillettes that were arrayed like the circuits of a microchip. And the long, flowing gowns that closed the show were topped with armorlike plastic breastplates in contrasting colors.</p><p>Continuing where he left off last season, Rodriguez worked both sides of the structure/flow divide. He opened the show with a pair of sharply tailored boleros and a patent raincoat—all with splices below the shoulders. His jackets, as complexly seamed as ever, had kicky little peplums, and pants were cut lean, mean, and a few inches above the ankle. For evening, things were mostly softer. Those aforementioned breastplates also came in delicate embroideries: black on teal and white on white. They can't protect you, but they will help you stand out at night.</p></div>"
112,spring,2007,s2007,nathan-jenden,"In creating his second solo collection, Nathan Jenden drew upon many ideas, including, ""Spring, unfurling, the lightness and airiness of insects that fly. And rolling out of bed. I love the idea of waking up after a party in a couture dress."" On top of that, his show referenced Victoriana and the French Court. That's more inspiration than one collection can be expected to handle, and today's presentation was somewhat scattered, though not without its winning moments. Bubble-hemmed trenches and poufs didn't do Jenden—or his models—any favors. He was on surer footing with pieces that displayed his tailoring skills and knack for intriguing details. The Diane von Furstenberg creative director cut beautiful, hand-painted silks into some sharp jackets. And two great ""tuxedos,"" one in crushed leather, the other in cashmere jersey, were worth getting out of bed for.</p></div>"
113,spring,2007,s2007,nicolas-andreas-taralis,"Nicolas Andreas Taralis is one of those designers—there have been a few this season—who make you think, all over again, of the huge void left by Helmut Lang. The Taralis synthesis of sharp tailoring and urban streetwear is fully in the Lang tradition (he studied under him in Austria), and he's one of the very few who is carrying it through with a genuine sense of purpose, rather than quoting from the nineties because it seems trendy right now.</p><p>""Chic, but tough. Something between elegance and hard-core sporty. There's too much nostalgia in fashion now."" With these words, he joined the season's rising debate around the need for contemporary modernism. Still, you can't emulate Lang without first knowing how to cut a sharp black jacket, neat chesterfield coat, and a great pair of pants. Taralis had all that in his sharky-cool lacquered-cotton mess jacket, narrow coat with leather inserts, and his hybrid motocross biker jeans. The new aspect for him was the introduction of sport elements: optic-white perforated cotton, leather, and performance mesh worked into tailored shirts; cross-strap tabard T-shirts, bombers, and parkas. He also shifted his liking for metallics into a lean techno-tissue pantsuit and a poncho in silver. With the addition of Velcro-tabbed leather sneakers—which Taralis calls ""futuristic Converse""—this below-the-radar collection represents a blip of hope for the lost legions who are still wearing out the last dependable threads of their vintage Lang.</p></div>"
114,spring,2007,s2007,noir,"Sexiness doesn't necessarily go with socio-eco responsibility. But with his Noir collection, Peter Ingwersen is out to prove otherwise. This Danish label is based on ""clean"" sourcing—from fairly traded African and organic cotton—and a bit of not-so-pure suggestiveness.</p><p>In practice, that meant a contrast between well-cut riding jackets, menswear-influenced shirting, and second-skin latex leggings, gloves, and tops. It was all executed in black, white, red, and flesh, and pulled together around the middle with artsily constructed cummerbunds. If some of the styling staggered into a Scandi-fetish zone where few will dare to tread, somehow it didn't detract from the good thoughts in there.</p></div>"
115,spring,2007,s2007,oscar-de-la-renta,"Give the ladies what they want—that's always been Oscar de la Renta's mantra, and for spring he didn't waver. Were there embroideries? You bet. And lace, crochet, and florals, too. The show opened with a red-poppy sundress with pockets, followed by another in a rich Himalayan blue. This collection wasn't wallflower material; bold, oversize prints shared the runway with saturated colors like azure, cherry, and marigold.</p><p>The designer kept things youthful with short silhouettes, though none were quite as brief as the crochet tunic Tanya Dziahileva wore to deliver red roses to front-row guest of honor Roger Federer. Perhaps Oscar whipped up the navy polo and white mini—one of the collection's only sporty moments—in honor of the U.S. Open champ. Other looks were less surprising. A year ago, de la Renta ushered in the return of the bubble—on this side of the Atlantic, at least—and he showed plenty of them today, in silk gazar for day and taffeta for night. But by now, that silhouette is starting to feel a little played out. What looked fresh for evening were his navy dresses. Among those, one in particular stood out: In front, it was a simple crepe column; in back, crystal buttons punctuated a gorgeous fall of fabric. Count on Oscar to bring the drama.</p></div>"
116,spring,2007,s2007,paul-smith,"For some reason, there's a bit of an American preppy feeling rising in certain quarters of the English design community. Paul Smith, too, has caught a touch of the nostalgia vibe for clean, conservative, outdoorsy classics. In his hands, it was the perfect excuse to indulge his affection for putting fresh-faced girls in clothes meant for boys.</p><p>In essence, this was a collection of simple separates—seersucker shorts, navy brass-buttoned blazers, slim pants, and vivid V-neck knits—with the odd pair of Brooks Brothers–type boxers peeking out of the waistlines. Nodding to the trend for shirt-dressing, he showed crisp white cottons and borrowed-from-the-boys pajama checks. Color choices—lavender with raspberry, leaf green with beige—are always a strength in this collection, but there was a lack of Smith's characteristic prints on show. For evening—as evening as this essentially easy collection gets—he used parachute silks floating breezily away from the body. The best bit, though, was the not-quite-right English eccentricity of loafers made in slightly tattered washed silks in pretty pastels.</p></div>"
117,spring,2007,s2007,peter-jensen,"London shows are usually about a marriage between fashion and art on some level—but not usually as literally as Peter Jensen's spring collection was. His show was not just dedicated to Tina Barney, but from backdrop to voice-over, it was a careful—and rather touching—attempt to reproduce scenes from the art photographer's Rhode Island album, <em>Theater of Manners</em>. In other words, Jensen gave us an ode to American sportswear and conservative special-occasion wear of the kind Barney captured—nostalgically yet tensely—being worn by her family in the late eighties and early nineties. ""Tina was involved all the way along,"" the designer said. ""We played her favorite tunes from Burt Bacharach and an interview I recorded with her.""</p><p>So, how did the clothes turn out? There were linen trenches, neat Prince of Wales pencil skirts, shorts, and miniskirts in seersucker; a red-and-white striped skirt was lifted straight from a photo of Barney's daughter in a beach towel. From there in, Jensen's transpositions were just a little weirder—shirtdresses acquired an eighties cocktail dress side-ruche, knotted cardigan sleeves were fused into shoulders and around hips. Any preppy American would identify this as not quite the real thing straight off, but that's the point about Jensen. For him, it was just another path into doing a quietly ironic take on ""normal"" clothes, which is exactly what his followers appreciate.</p></div>"
118,spring,2007,s2007,peter-som,"Peter Som did his homework, visiting the Louvre and studying eighteenth-century garments at the Costume Institute, before designing for spring. Thankfully, though, he didn't take his sources too literally. Instead, he presented a collection that, while it took few risks, was full of pretty but not overdone confections that should be right up his well-heeled customer's avenue. ""I was thinking about pared-down luxury—not minimalism,"" the designer said. ""My aim was to spin texture and tone with a light touch.""</p><p>There was lightness in the palette, which ranged from dove gray to buttermilk and was punctuated with patent shoes in ""crazy makeup"" colors. Generally, Som went in for matte effects rather than shine, and fabrics like Jacquards and burlap parchments added a tactile quality. Watteau backs offered a variation on the trapeze, moving volume to the rear, a conceit that was especially effective in the finale trio of washed organdy gowns. Som's collection stressed evening over daywear—not a lot of this would look right in an office—but then he knows his fans aren't exactly 9 to 5 types.</p></div>"
119,spring,2007,s2007,phi,"The Susan Dell-backed Phi line continues to evolve in a carefully measured way, with designer Andreas Melbostad honing in on a new, tightly defined area each season. Inspired by, among other things, the moody, misty photographs of Deborah Turbeville, Melbostad said goodbye to fall's tailored coats and strong shoulders in favor of multilayered ensembles (many had five elements) made of white, pink, and black silk and chiffon. One tank dress featured sequins embroidered on tulle in a Renaissance pattern, paired with a delicate bra and a flounced skirt. A white dress with flower appliqués was a crowd favorite, and finely knit Henleys worn over sheer culottes proved an interesting study in texture and opacity.</p><p>Phi is about consistency, not variety, but some of Melbostad's many variations on a few silhouettes shaded into the repetitive. They were, however, as meticulously made as ever, with a youthful appeal that might speak to the customer who liked fall's wispy, Biba-esque dresses.</p></div>"
120,spring,2007,s2007,pollini,"""It's short and it's lean,"" explained Rifat Ozbek backstage at his Pollini show. But to say that is to rather simplify things. This is a designer who's never dreamed up an exotic inspiration he didn't like, and his spring collection was full of them, distractingly so at times. The South Seas gave him tribal tattoo prints for strapless dresses, as well as the feathers that accented necklines; Japan, the origami-like discs that edged the hem of a narrow sheath; and Hawaii, the silver-and-gold brocade that he spliced into narrow strips and tiered to the ground. Did Ozbek take a whirlwind trip recently? ""No,"" he said. ""It's all just in my head.""</p><p>All this was accessorized with Philip Treacy's plumed crowns, as well as Bakelite neckpieces and cuffs—more often than not, the effect was overwhelming . Ethnic, as a category, just doesn't have the grip on the fashion community that it did not so long ago. In a season of sixties shifts, though, Ozbek cut one of the best. It came with long sleeves and a stand-away collar that will accentuate delicate collarbones and a slender neck. And no modern-day Gidget will be able to resist an abstract orchid-print sleeveless shift with filigrees of cream embroidery.</p></div>"
121,spring,2007,s2007,prada,"When Miuccia Prada is on form, only one thing's guaranteed: Whatever she did last season, she'll be the first to hate it, throw it out, and start somewhere else. Thus, fashion's most restless creative force has nixed the street-fighting toughie look she did for winter. In its place was a startling, destabilizing piece of extreme chic that flew directly in the face of all the current chatter about lightness, volume, and shades of beige.</p><p>A turbaned girl in a burgundy duchesse ultrashort tunic—all bare legs and high heels—started the show off, swiftly followed by another in a purple, high-necked long-sleeved satin dress reaching below the knee. What was this? Why were nylon backpacks strapped to those tiny, bottom-skimming tops? Why were these looks interspersed with forties-looking, rounded-shoulder dresses, blouses, and slim pencil skirts? And why all the strong reds, oranges, and jewel-colored satins for summer?</p><p>Because Prada felt like it. ""I just wanted it to be about fashion,"" she shrugged backstage. ""The importance of fashion."" Still, this collection held an image of a powerful woman at its center, filtered through unmistakable references to Yves Saint Laurent (his ""forties"" collection from the seventies; a touch Loulou de la Falaise, to be precise). These were not random choices; in fact, they are two of the underlying constants in Prada's work. One thing she despises, though, is the overinterpretation of her motives; instinct and spontaneity guide her just as much as intellectual reasoning. She laughed at one journalist's anxious questioning about the short pieces, saying, ""I just didn't like anything I did below the waist."" Meaning, ""Don't panic, these are tops."" And, like everything else in this richly provocative show, they're going to look totally wearable in a store come spring.</p></div>"
122,spring,2007,s2007,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Call it the Marie Antoinette effect: Skirts that stick out in panniers from the hips have been popping up in several collections in London. At Preen, Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton made theirs short and modernist, cutting them into abbreviated skirts or soft, molded leather dresses. The full hips, Bregazzi said, were inspired by Sofia Coppola's film, ""but we wanted to look at the past and the future at the same time.""</p><p>This leggy collection fits into the obsession with body-consciousness and the manipulation of shape that are gripping young London designers. Apart from the blown-up skirts—an abstract exaggeration of the tulip that's been around for a couple of seasons—Preen also explored the possibilities of spirally bandaged second-skin silhouettes. The best were wrapped bands of black elastic, layered pinafore-fashion over crisp white shirts, a styling device that prevented the look from turning too tarty. Moments like that demonstrated how this duo has grown up. They're celebrating their tenth year in business, and for an independent company, that's an achievement in any city.</p></div>"
123,spring,2007,s2007,pringle-of-scotland,"With designers as well loved and well established as Marc Jacobs putting T-shirt dresses on their catwalks this season, Pringle's Clare Waight Keller has set herself a difficult task: turning humble knit separates into anonymously cool luxury items and making them stand out in a crowded market. With help from stylist Karl Templer and a pretty pack of A-list models, this Ralph Lauren and Gucci alum mostly succeeded for spring. Working in nude, black, heather gray, and white, she kept her silhouettes young, short, and, for the most part, airy, save for a pair of leggings and some needle-thin pants. Dresses were drop-waisted and covered with tiny pleats like something a flapper would've worn, minus the sequins and beads; jackets came short-sleeved with swingy volume at the back; and pin-tucked puff-sleeve blouses topped cuffed walking shorts.</p><p>A basketweave-like knit that appeared as a blouson sweater as well as at the collar of a coat took advantage of Pringle's rich heritage of knits, but it didn't mesh with the rest of the collection. Still, she turned out her own must-have in the form of a sack dress made from silver-sequin-embellished cotton jersey—a promising development given that this was only the designer's second foray onto the runway for Pringle.</p></div>"
124,spring,2007,s2007,proenza-schouler,"Among other things, the eighties gave fashion Hervé Léger and OP surfwear. Proenza Schouler's Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough, children of that decade, brought the two together on their spring runway—it's not as unlikely a pairing as it sounds. ""It's about elevating sporty,"" the duo said of the new collection. That meant reworking windbreakers as button-downs under almost-rustic hemp blazers; using the cut and seaming of an old-school surfer's wetsuit for sleek, rubberized linen dresses and knit leggings; and transforming a boxy tee into an evening piece with colorful, graphic sequins. The last was tucked into a teal silk-moiré skirt, a little A-line number that was cut above the knee.</p><p>Those proportions looked fresh and right. But proportions become a trickier proposition when you get to bandage dressing. Only the likes of front-row celeb Victoria Beckham could pull off the unforgiving pink-and-orange tube skirt. Still, the rest of Proenza's fans will probably be happy with the bra tops made from the stretchy stuff, and they'll love the racer-back tanks in swatches of Ellsworth Kelly stripes. This collection may not have been as tight as last season's, or as rich, but there was more than enough evidence that these designers are still on their game.</p></div>"
125,spring,2007,s2007,rag-bone,"""They make the best jeans. Any denim nerd knows that,"" said Jimmy Fallon before the Rag &amp; Bone show got underway at the former nightclub, Tunnel. Brits David Neville and Marcus Wainwright—co-founder Nathan Bogle left the company earlier this summer—did show cool stovepipe jeans with equally slim seamed blazers to match. And a smart, charcoal gray twill mac had the punk-rock edge they said they were going for backstage. Pinafore dresses in gauze and silk charmeuse, though, are newer territory for the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists. It may take another season—this is only their third showing women's—before the young designers can say that their girlish frocks boast the fit that their other pieces have become known for.</p></div>"
126,spring,2007,s2007,ralph-lauren,"A tip of the hat to Ralph Lauren, whose sharp spring collection cut through the haze of tulle and organza that was New York like a knife through butter. Last season's English hunting party has charted a course through North Africa and colonial India—hence the serapes and metallic work in today's mix. Mostly though, this was a show of polished clothes that only glancingly hinted at their exotic inspirations.</p><p>He started things off with trim pinstripe vests over looser bib-front shirts and wide-legged cuffed trousers or shorts. Suits in silk jacquard and antique linen took a dressier direction; jackets were snug-fitting and peplumed, and pants came slim and cropped above the ankles to show off peep-toe patent heels. The show's black-and-white motif—count on Lauren to nail the trends without appearing to try—extended into dresses, including a strikingly pretty paisley floral tea-length silk with puff sleeves.</p><p>The silvers and platinums arrived with his substantially expanded nighttime offerings. Lauren has absorbed today's more relaxed approach to after-dark dressing, so he paired linen shirts with metallic-brocade skirts and pants. But this wouldn't be a Ralph show without a few showstoppers, and the designer gave Diane Kruger (sitting front row in his fall cape and over-the-knee boots) what she came for: a short, drop-waist beaded twenties dress that spelled restrained glamour.</p></div>"
127,spring,2007,s2007,ralph-rucci,"With its Japanese backdrop screens and the Noh face silk-screened on a dress, there was something about Ralph Rucci's latest collection that suggested pillow books—the intense, intimate diaries that geishas once kept. There was certainly a quality of private obsession in the extraordinary—even for him—attention to detail: the organza inserts on a wool jacket, for instance, or the embroidery on the black velvet underskirt of a purple satin gown from the couture collection, which comprised the show's second half. Rucci presented some extravagant wonders, such as a jacket covered with porcupine quills, and a green satin coat bedecked with feathers that quivered like leaves in a breeze-blown forest. Such subtle movement was a riposte to those who claim the designer's clothes are paralyzed by technique. The pillow-book analogy was suggested again in a pattern composed of Rucci's own semi-indecipherable handwriting, which was printed on a tank and embroidered on a caftan. If all this ensured that this was one of Rucci's quieter outings, it was nevertheless a privilege to watch him work through his self-imposed design challenges.</p></div>"
128,spring,2007,s2007,richard-chai-love,"Richard Chai chose a pair of diverse influences for his spring collection: photographer Bruce Davidson's ""Brooklyn Gang"" series… and flowers. The latter inspired dresses that were darted and draped to move around the body and festooned with folded pleats and gauzy, rippled neck details. These romantic pieces were best when applied with a light hand, but Chai's desire to devise evermore cunning methods of construction sometimes resulted in looks that were overdesigned. Fortunately, his other stated inspiration—Davidson's no-frills fifties tough guys—helped him keep things simple. The first look—Ikeliene Stange in slim, light-blue jeans and a seamed jacket with standing collar worn over a white shirt—hit all the right notes. So did a sharp sundress, some of the structured coats, and a well-cut bomber made of eelskin. Chai said his goal with this collection was to ""make artfully crafted, special pieces that can be worn casually,"" and for the most part, he succeeded.</p></div>"
129,spring,2007,s2007,richard-nicoll,"What is it about polka dots? It's hard to contain them as a minor theme in a collection, and once you let them loose, they can end up smothering the lot. Perhaps that was where Richard Nicoll started to go wrong with his summer collection—that, and trying to stretch his ideas out too far.</p><p>What Nicoll does very well is shirts. He's even evolved his own signature shape, which is tight, strict, tucked to under the bust, and then floaty below, sometimes with extra long tails for good measure. That's a good look for a lot of women, and quite a smattering in the audience were already wearing his Victoriana winter version. Still, Nicoll has yet to work out what might be equally pleasing to go on the bottom half. For spring, his solution is voluminously pleated, polka-dotted pants, or otherwise short shorts, neither of which exactly have that instant must-wear appeal.</p></div>"
130,spring,2007,s2007,rick-owens,"""Dad read me fantasy stories when I was a kid in the seventies, with Frank Frazetta's illustrations of mysterious, intergalatic regal queens being fought over. I was brought up on that—and Wagner,"" said Rick Owens. ""So this is for Dad—he's here."" Backstory revealed, Owens sent out his lightest and most ethereal collection to date, shown on the sidewalk outside his newly opened store in the Palais Royal. Pure-white organdy asymmetric jackets, crunched up around the neck and gathered into a peplum in back, were paired with complex handkerchief-point or draped skirts, striding leggily out on shaggy-chiffon, signature-Rick shoes.</p><p>The lightness, together with rock-couturish flourishes like the spiky black ribbon-ties jutting from shoulder fastenings, turned this into a sit-up-and-take-notice sequel to Owens' more predictable journeys around his personal netherworld. Funnel hoods, pulled all the way over to veil faces, gave a semi-scary jolt, but that was only a problem until they were pushed back—then they were just a detail in an elegant, flyaway evening coat. Still, like other designers this season, Owens didn't have the bottom half of his collection resolved. His dresses were in the bias-cut groove he's worked forever—the aesthetic he calls ""Scotch-taped Vionnet""—but, annoyingly, this time they were all sheer. A quick Google search of Frazetta (there's a museum in Pennsylvania) shows why: All of those lusty maidens were nude. Panties don't really solve that problem, so let's hope Owens has a few boring old slips in reserve to help out.</p></div>"
131,spring,2007,s2007,roberto-cavalli,"What was remarkable about Roberto Cavalli's show was how subdued it felt. Yes, there were back-laced corsets, silver and gold embellishments, and beads galore. But the glamazon of collections past, who first showed signs of flagging last season, has been replaced by a woman who wears a thick braid in her hair and more often than not works the subtler side of sexy. How? By donning toreador jackets and a relaxed pant, cut full through the leg and cropped at mid-calf. She even, believe it or not, wears flats. The result was a show that took a step or two in a new direction without alienating Cavalli's core customer.</p><p>Just because there was a masculine undercurrent to the collection didn't mean that there wasn't plenty of the line's signature flash. Those jackets were edged in lavish embroideries and beads; shirt fronts were dripping in frills; and a coat in metallic leather was so elaborately laser-cut it could've been lace. Ethnic touches, nearly absent in New York and London, have been edging their way back onto the Milan runways. The fringe seen elsewhere this week appeared on a shirtdress, as well as at the hems of suede skirts macraméd through the waist and hips. A flamenco dancer's flounces, meanwhile, decorated the sleeves of a crystal-belted dress.</p><p>No Cavalli show is complete without animal prints, of course. For spring, leopard prints dotted a corset and zebra stripes radiated from the center of a chiffon gown with dramatically trailing sleeves. This piece stood out from more predictable evening fare, such as halter gowns with open backs and a provocatively sheer rhinestone-encrusted dress. He edged into showgirl territory with a beaded black number that wasn't much more substantial than a leotard, but again, it didn't look crass. And, after all, he has to give his loyalists what they come for.</p></div>"
132,spring,2007,s2007,rodarte,"At a recent Robert Rauschenberg exhibition, Rodarte's Laura and Kate Mulleavy had the experience of ""being hit over the head with visual impact,"" and they set out to do the same with their spring collection. The sisters, CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists, are passionate—even obsessive—about the construction of their clothes, and it showed in details large and small, such as bow collars, handmade flowers, and feather appliqués. Almost everything in this collection was exaggerated in terms of volume and finish. Keen students of the eighteenth-century painter Thomas Gainsborough, the Mulleavys sent out pieces that recalled sartorial conceits of yore, like panniers and infanta-style skirts, and they attached an obi-like appendage to the back of an appliquéd gown.</p><p>The result of all this was a collection that might not have looked out of place in a classic Irving Penn spread, but what of its position in the modern world? Many in the audience—including Karen Elson and Sarah Sophie Flicker—were wearing dresses from Rodarte's previous spring collection, and they couldn't have looked chicer. This time around, there were fewer viable real-life options. (One exception was a lean, mean pant in black or deep pink, paired with a white blouse). Still, the balance between art and wearability is something these talented designers should have plenty of time to perfect in the future.</p></div>"
133,spring,2007,s2007,roksanda,"""I love big shapes, and I thought I would push it,"" said Roksanda Ilincic. ""So I started a dress like a cloud and it just became bigger and bigger."" The slightly off-kilter charm of this Serbian-born designer's clothes—cocktail dressing that teeters on the brink of being a bit bonkers—is coming more into its own with every season. She's established such signatures as big bows, unhemmed edges, charmeuse slips, and puffed-up volumes, but this collection pushed her repertoire further.</p><p>Inspired, she said, by paintings of the Spanish court, Ilincic padded hips into vaguely eighteenth-century pannier shapes with the tulle understuffing she also uses to perk out an oversize pair of sleeves, froth a peplum, or create unexpectedly huge bustles in back of slim dresses. Taking traditional English brocades from Gainsborough silks (a weaver that makes wall hangings for the Queen's boudoir, no less), she turned the fabric inside out and used the loose gold threads as decoration. The result: a series of rich but cool-looking pieces with a quirky, yet essentially feminine presence.</p></div>"
134,spring,2007,s2007,ruffian,"It's nice to see Ruffian's young designers Brian Wolk and Claude Morais making clothes for women their own age. Without losing too much of their signature vocabulary—the full pants and the dramatic sleeves, the pintucking and the accordion pleats—they injected a welcome dose of hip into their spring proceedings. A pair of streamlined fencing trenches in gray and mustard that doubled as A-line shifts were almost minimal, and criss-cross minidresses, shown in white denim and black bouclé, displayed a similar graphic simplicity. But the duo didn't abandon frills entirely. The stiff, waxed cotton ruffles that decorated the neckline and shoulders of wrap dresses grazed the models' earlobes (the silhouette worked better in soft organdy), and art deco beading modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater blueprints embellished an indigo georgette shift—just the thing for a modern girl.</p></div>"
135,spring,2007,s2007,sabyasachi,"The fashion world of late has been focusing lots of energy on emerging markets like China and India. Although many major Western labels rely on the latter as a source of handiwork, there haven't really been any breakthrough designers of Indian descent. Calcutta-based Sabyasachi (rhymes with Versace) Mukherjee, whose collection debuted today in New York, is someone with a shot at changing that. Having sold successfully in London at Browns for several seasons, he was recently picked up by Tracey Ross in Los Angeles.</p><p>For spring, Mukherjee showed a collection that was highly reminiscent of the one he showed for fall in Mumbai. His selection of silhouettes was limited, but his bubbles and trapezes felt right for the season, as did plaid and embroidery. Traditional Indian elements like patchwork and beading were applied with a light touch, and the palette—deep-hued, not bright—was inspired by a collection of painted teapots the designer spied at a friend's house—a touch that added to this promising collection's quirky appeal.</p></div>"
136,spring,2007,s2007,saint-laurent,"Stefano Pilati said he had been inspired by ""violets, which to the Greeks symbolized modesty, humility, and virginity—and the feeling of transition from spring into summer."" To that end, he laid out one of the prettiest—yet most hazardous—runways ever trodden by models in spike-heel platforms: a deep, earthen lawn planted with hundreds of living purple violas. In theory, it was poetic, but the girls¿ tentative, anxiety-raising progress created an unfortunate distraction that disrupted the viewing of Pilati¿s most beautiful pieces.</p><p>The best of them came toward the end—a section of gowns in purple or violet-printed chiffon with billowy, flyaway skirts, and the white flower-garlanded halter-necked finale dress, cut to fall erotically away from the back. Pilati¿s conceptual journey to this point was, however, trickier to follow. It started promisingly with black-and-white picnic check, well cut into a tightly belted, slope-shouldered Parisian-chic coat with a high-necked ruffle blouse. The recurring spring-flower theme built into clusters of fragile, white cutout organdy violets in a tuxedo shirt, petal-smothered skirts, and 3-D leather decorations trailing from bags. Other standouts were a black swing-back shirtdress with a white cotton bib; a short nude organza cocktail dress, piped in black; and the odd toughening elements, like belted leather shell tops. The difficulty? In the pants. Like several designers in Paris, Pilati is applying himself to thinking a way out of skinnies. It¿s a project that eventually will reach some attractive conclusion—but his baglike lowering of crotch to ankle is, to put it kindly, not quite there yet.</p></div>"
137,spring,2007,s2007,sari-gueron,"""I wanted this collection to reflect how me and my friends wear our clothes, which is very chill,"" explained surfer/designer Sari Gueron, who, true to her word, styled her spring collection in a laid-back manner, right down to the Birkenstocks on the models' feet. The designer caught her wave with look one—a simple shift with a flower corsage—and rode it successfully to the close of one of her strongest showings yet.</p><p>Gueron, who started her career showing small groups of dresses, has added to her repertoire slowly and steadily. This season's simple shapes were derived from her study of Asian dress and Victorian children's clothes and rendered in fragile poplin, crinkled silk chiffon, and patterned jacquard. Though the separates stood on their own, the audience still comes to see the frocks. Standouts included sheer, short day options worn over bikinis (one expects they will be delivered lined to stores); breezy floor-length numbers, some with quilted yokes; and dressier options with subtle details like a flower-backed belt. This Gidget is growing up.</p></div>"
138,spring,2007,s2007,sinha-stanic,"Sinha-Stanic were spot-on about one thing: the way fashion girls have taken to clomping around London on soles six inches thick. The show's perilously high wedges provided a focus—or rather a bit of a cliff-hanger. When, you wondered, would someone finally crash over?</p><p>As for the collection itself, Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic began by working their own relatively understated versions of London's bod-conscious revival. For them, it's about a super-cropped bolero and lots of zipper action, a theme derived from motocross biking. In their determination to drive their ideas away from the literal starting point, however, things got a little snarled up. Skirts with folded-down flaps and hemlines trimmed with zippers only ended up suggesting one thing: ""Ouch!""</p><p>These designers are better when they don't try too hard to be part of the gang. Has their customer, who was initially drawn to the believable, career-friendly modernism of their clothes, suddenly morphed into a seeker of skimpy bandage dresses? Their natural talents veer more toward clean, artistic prints on fluid chiffon and cool reinterpretations of pantsuits. Thank goodness, they managed to show a couple of those—but in the end, the last model did fall.</p></div>"
139,spring,2007,s2007,sonia-rykiel,"That vacant, thousand-yard stare so popular with today¿s models can be a bit of a downer. Is it really so bad up there? Today, though, Sonia Rykiel¿s girls had been told to ham it up, and it wasn¿t just their contagious grins that made the audience smile. Rykiel started with striped black-and-white knits in the shapes of next spring: the shirtdress, the mini, and the one-shoulder frock. From there, she moved onto maillots, some with cutouts, and L.B.D.s with mesh inserts forming trompe l¿oeil bows. Color came into the equation with ruffle-edged chiffon baby dolls and trapezes, along with duchesse satin shifts.</p><p>With their superwide legs and stiff jackets, denim suits in pink or white felt clumsy compared with the effortless dresses, as did a series of creamy, too-heavy-for-the-season cable sweaters. Recovering swiftly, this perennial knit-wit sent her girls out for the finale in a rainbow of strapless frocks woven on the front with women¿s faces in expressions ranging from pique to ecstasy. The effect: <em>très charmant.</em></p></div>"
140,spring,2007,s2007,sophia-kokosalaki,"¿I did soft,¿ said Sophia Kokosalaki. ¿I was looking at <em>Vogue</em> photographs by Javier Vallhonrat and Paolo Roversi from the eighties. I liked their saturated color and romanticism. Everyone thinks the eighties were so virulent, but there was another, beautiful side people are overlooking.¿ First, though, this young, independent Greek designer had to fight not to get overlooked herself. Sandwiched between Karl Lagerfeld and Valentino, she helplessly waited an hour for 12 models to show, a delay that sorely tested her audience's patience.</p><p>When it finally started, the collection was a more refined rendition of Kokosalaki¿s signature combination of intensely worked draped dresses and modern tailoring. The promised softness was in the pliant, wavily worked Grecian pleating in the high-waisted bodices (she¿s wisely thrown out the padded understructures). These bloomed into short organza skirts. The tailored pieces—belted safari jackets with balloon sleeves and rolled-cuff shorts—also took on a slouchier, sportier ease. Shots of neon green put a London-club spike in the palette of muted ecrus, metallics, oranges, and browns. Styling it all with flat cross-laced sandals and gladiator boots, she brought together a personal look that deserves a better airing than in the difficult crevice the schedule forced on her.</p></div>"
141,spring,2007,s2007,strk,"""Ever since I did my work placement with Patrick Robinson, I wanted to live in New York,"" explained Danish-born designer Camilla Stærk, who moved her collection from the London schedule—and herself to NYC—just one week ago.</p><p>The 12 pieces she presented at Scandinavia House today showed no signs of jet lag. More romantic than usual, the new collection diverged from her preferred black to incorporate pastels. Lean sweater dresses with unexpected sack backs had belts threaded through them ""to create a small waist""; elsewhere she used knot details to add a little volume. Fabrics ranged from coated cotton to treated leather to lace. Several of the outfits were layered over latex tanks, inspired by David Lynch's characters Laura Palmer and Donna Hayward. It was a very Stærk touch. ""Even though I did latex in innocent and bright colors, there's something naughty about it,"" she said. With this collection, she succeeded in updating her body-conscious aesthetic and bringing it to a wider audience.</p></div>"
142,spring,2007,s2007,stella-mccartney,"With her second child on the way, it would seem that Stella McCartney has ease on her mind. And if her new collection's all-in-ones were a bit too <em>Romper Room</em>, she showed plenty that was viable and in keeping with the season's themes: puff-sleeved sack dresses, tent coats with round collars that perched airily about the shoulders, and double-layer silk frocks in gorgeous kelly greens. She also had her signature slouchy shirtdresses, although these last were awkwardly sewn together between the knees.</p><p>The vibe for evening was just as breezy, even a bit Californian—a nod, perhaps, to her Hollywood fans. Short, racer-back tank dresses came covered in studs, while a silk organza trapeze was pin-tucked from waist to hem in gently rolling waves.</p><p>But nothing got the pulse racing quite like the show's great-looking, newly proportioned suits. Longer through the jacket but still slim, and with high-waisted, straight-leg pants, they were a sophisticated, yet sexy antidote to the show's otherwise billowing bubble shapes. McCartney earned her recent renown as a women's designer by making clothes to suit not just playtime but all of the complex obligations of modern girls like herself. That's why you'll likely find a lot more of those Savile Row–inflected stunners in the showroom.</p></div>"
143,spring,2007,s2007,stephen-burrows,"For those who remember or have heard tell about the time when Stephen Burrows and fellow American designers blew into Paris for the monumental ""Versailles 1973"" show, his comeback tour came off as something of a letdown. The catacombs of the Louvre have nothing on Louis XVI's palace, of course, but the show's disappointments went beyond the location. The models, the hair and makeup, the shoes—they all could've used an upgrade. Sterling-silver belts and minaudières by Burrows' sponsor and old friend Elsa Peretti, in contrast, were more chic. The clothes themselves, though, didn't hold up in the Paris big leagues.</p><p>Burrows' lettuce-edged jersey dance dresses were the embodiment of his body-conscious Studio 54 heyday. For spring, he revisited those old favorites, color blocking their bodices with sunset hues or Caribbean island blues. But, like the chiffon animal-print mélanges, they didn't have the modern zing they did three decades ago. He should think twice before leaving his home turf again. Either that, or do the kind of homework it takes to make a mark here.</p></div>"
144,spring,2007,s2007,tao,"In the space of three seasons, Tao Kurihara's minute, off-schedule shows have come to generate the kind of panic-to-be-there that has journalists calling and texting and dashing through traffic to make it. It's such a must-see that, by the time her all-white ""shirts and weddings"" collection began to pad quietly out in the Comme des Garçons showroom, rain-bedraggled faces were pressed up against the windows and doors outside.</p><p>What was the focus of all this fuss? Another of Tao's small and prettily formed concept collections in which two ideas glide together—a kind of girly haiku in dress form. This time, it was centered on ruffle-front white shirts, kilted skirts with bustled flounces of dotted net, and ballet slippers, worn by girls with circlets of white paper flowers in their hair. As the bridesmaids passed to and fro, the scrolled cascades of their shirt fronts and tiered skirts began to take on the details of wedding-cake decorations. Rows of bows were planted on skirts; tiny frills resembling piped icing circled the legs of trousers. By the end, the dresses morphed into pieces of crinolined confectionery, scissored out of white paper. That inched Tao a step or two toward fantasy, but not so much that it distracted from the salable charm of her way with a fragile Victorian puff-sleeved blouse or a perfect little silk-knit polo jersey.</p><p>As the audience peeled off into the street, the debrief chatter circled around the fact that Junya Watanabe, also of the house of Comme, had concentrated much of his efforts on white shirts this season—as have many others in the fashion world at large. That slightly diluted the aura of from-nowhere ingenuity that surrounds Tao's work, but no matter. Her only worry ought to be finding a bigger space to contain her fans next season.</p></div>"
145,spring,2007,s2007,temperley-london,"Could the launch of Temperley London bags, belts, and sunglasses on today's runway have any connection with rumors that the company has been in talks with Gucci Group? It was evident that a lot of effort had gone into the studded hold-all bags and lion-headed belts, so much so that the clothes, at times, seemed to have been relegated to the role of accessory. Alice Temperley fans who look to the line for hand-embellished dresses and gowns with boho glam will have to search hard to find them here. Instead, the designer set out to ""encompass a more complete range of daywear through to red carpet."" Several of the resulting pieces—jumpsuits (one in leopard intarsia), for example, or high-waisted pants and minis—did not play to her strengths, however, to say the least . Thankfully, there were a few familiar silhouettes: a draped minidress with delicately bubbled hem stood out, as did a smocked prairie tunic that captured the collection's ""nomad"" theme and showed the designer on form.</p></div>"
146,spring,2007,s2007,thakoon,"Inspiration can come from anywhere: for Thakoon Panichgul it was the bouquets of peonies and hydrangeas he received from well-wishers after he was nominated for the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund. The designer took the flowers as his starting point, using weighty fabrics like taffeta and organza to create form, and employing ruffles and pleats to make delicate petal sleeves and layered rosebud miniskirts. A standout for evening was a rhubarb-colored column gown worn by Kim Noorda, which had a subtle appliqué underskirt. In contrast, a short trapeze trench over a blossom skirt looked more like a sculpture than a viable wardrobe choice. Kimono shapes popped up throughout the mostly floral collection, adding variety to an accomplished, pretty, but somewhat one-note show.</p></div>"
147,spring,2007,s2007,threeasfour,"Under the Buckminster Fuller-style Dome at the Soho Grand, Threeasfour’s Gabi, Ange, and Adi presented a collection based on fractals—repeated geometric patterns that exist outside of classical geometry and are often used in computer modeling. Yes, that old fashion inspiration. But if the concept sounds far-fetched, it’s one the trio takes very seriously; they say they worked for over a year, collaborating with a textile manufacturer and a math wizard, to produce the fractal prints that served as the main conceit of this intriguing if overlong presentation. And while there were a few <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> moments here today (green Lycra leggings with lace inserts, anyone?), they were balanced by some lovely suspension “flip” pieces and dresses with dimensional plastic appliqués. (These were the favorites of front-row booster Kate Spade.) There were also sporty, tailored separates, including a black trench and a white suit with skinny pants, that would measure up in any dimension.</p></div>"
148,spring,2007,s2007,todd-lynn,"Todd Lynn, the Canadian rocker dude Roland Mouret called ""my right hand,"" always had a nice little business on the side. An ace cutter, he's a favorite of Marilyn Manson, Bono, and Jagger for bespoke stage gear. For the most part, though, Lynn was happy to toil away in Mouret's back room—until, that is, a disastrous disagreement between his boss and management brought the company down. ""For me, it was a case of now or never,"" Lynn says. ""I decided I finally had to do what I wanted to do.""</p><p>Essentially, that turns out to be rock 'n' roll tailoring—but with a slick, deluxe edge, and cut to fit girls as well as boys of the six-foot, no-hip variety. Lynn's way with a sharp white leather tux jacket and a great pair of pleated pants has been honed over time, and his obsessive care over choosing classically excellent men's fabric pays off in the execution. Moreover, it seemed the world really was waiting for what he had to say—at least to judge from the stellar audience that lined the walls of the Proud Gallery in Camden Town for his debut. Among them were members of the Dirty Pretty Things, the Licks, and, lo and behold, Giorgio Armani and his entourage.</p></div>"
149,spring,2007,s2007,toni-maticevski,"Aussie Toni Maticevski arrived at the UPS Hub without a great deal of fanfare, but left with lots of new friends. He showed an appealing, delicate collection featuring trapeze shapes and diaphanous fabrics. ""I wanted to explore textures and techniques, and dimensionality rather than make flat clothes,"" he said backstage. Organza and voile were some of the fabrics Maticevski used to give volume to sixties A-line shapes. In contrast, silk satin was draped and knotted to liquid effect.</p><p>The show was uneven—a blouse with Capulet sleeves seemed incongruous, as did a lone menswear look, paraded barefoot no less—but there was promise here. The eveningwear in particular was winning, especially a silk and tulle gown that looked as light as a cloud.</p></div>"
150,spring,2007,s2007,topshop-unique,"Kate Moss popping up in the front row of the Topshop Unique show was such an eye-swiveller that the A-line skirts, floppy shirtdresses, and all-in-ones designed in-house by Nick Passmore and her team had a tough time competing for attention. Moss was on the brink of signing up to do her own line for the company, and the reason she was about to commit had as much to do with the quality of the clothes on the runway as it had to do with the billions of its owner, Philip Green, sitting next to her. Topshop's instinct-led culture (phooey to focus groups, say the girls) has created Britain's fastest, most on-the-money high street fashion brand, one that often gets the gist of trends at the same time as more elevated designers.</p><p>A second glance at the Unique line for spring proved that point. Simple, breezy cotton smock tops and short roomy dresses in rumpled linen were sexed up a bit with the addition of short-shorts, rompers, and sharp shots of acid yellow. The effect was somewhere between Chloé and Marc by Marc Jacobs, with a lot of the less 'designed' pieces looking on target enough to please the brand's millions of young followers. The showing of a small segment of Topshop's massive inventory may not amount to a 'collection' as we know it on loftier runways, but Topshop's brain trust is on to something. They know that the best way to look cool is never to try too hard—a subject upon which Miss Moss is, of course, a world authority.</p></div>"
151,spring,2007,s2007,tory-burch,"Tory Burch, as one admirer noted in the elevator after the designer's spring presentation, wears her own clothes well. The secret to her success is that a lot of other people can too—and not just her fellow uptown girls. Much has been made of the fact that she hired the MisShapes to deejay at her presentation, high above Fifth Avenue. What was the club kids' take on it all? ""Tory is dong a great job of bringing uptown and downtown together,"" said Geordon Nicol, who was wearing a Tory sweater. ""Just the fact that she hired us is proof of that."" Meanwhile, his partner in crime, Leigh Lezark, was working a silver sequin dress from spring that had not a whiff of Lilly Pulitzer about it.</p><p>Burch is hardly a conceptual designer, but today's show had three sections: a black-and-white story; a Turkish tale, featuring prints in bright blues; and an African theme, worked around a brown-and-white print. It wasn't necessary to know this, though, to get the clothes—or the accessories for that matter. You could jazz up a sand-colored linen dress with a print hold-all or a shiny patent shopper in black or orange. Or, perhaps, pair a peace sign/Tory ""T"" logo bikini with metallic thongs, ballet flats, or jazzy wedges. The point of this sure-to-sell collection being that the choice is yours.</p></div>"
152,spring,2007,s2007,trovata,"In a change of tack from last season's formal runway show, the Trovata team decided to showcase their Spring 2007 collection by throwing a party complete with a live band, margaritas, and even a raffle. All of the hullabaloo may have made the clothes seem like an afterthought, but this was, in fact, a better setting in which to appreciate the whimsical touches—like flamboyant linings and oversized, mismatched buttons—for which the young label is known.</p><p>Spring's quirky story line centers on a pair of divers in Cuba circa 1974, so the team showed a navy-and-white striped sweater and a strapless dress that looked like the bottom half of a double-breasted pea coat, along with faded preppy basics like khaki trenches, chambray shirtdresses, cuffed shorts, and crochet knits. Sunken-treasure necklaces and chunky charm bracelets by Subversive Jewelry's Justin Giunta, a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist, added a layer of cool to the modest collection.</p></div>"
153,spring,2007,s2007,tse,"Designer Tess Giberson's second outing for TSE focused on ideas of weight and weightlessness. Much of the collection—which included cotton-linen shorts, mesh cardigans, and hoodies that would make great beach cover-ups—successfully captured a summery feeling, with a long, swingy silhouette that worked best in the combination of the vapory tulle blouse, mesh over-tunic, and long white linen skirt worn by Kim Noorda.</p><p>TSE is literally trying to reposition itself—their boutique is being relocated from Madison Avenue to an as-yet-undisclosed, ""hip"" new location—and Giberson said after the show that she believes cashmere can be ""more than a basic."" But it was hard to see the more ""designed"" pieces that she sent out—like the heavy-knit ""exaggerated"" pants with crotches that fell inches above the ankle—as having much of a life off the runway. On the other hand, the classics and variations thereof—a linen coat, rethought cable knits—looked just right.</p></div>"
154,spring,2007,s2007,tuleh,"At the close of his spring show, titled ""American Spectators,"" Bryan Bradley took a bow in camouflage pants with a Stars and Stripes bandana tied on his head. The collection's back story, the designer said, was ""Western entropy versus Eastern ascendancy."" Accordingly, there was an Orientalist flavor throughout. Jessica Stam came out in a lacquer-black cracked-leather coat with an asymmetric button close, and the last look, a red coat, had standing seams that projected both Mandarin might and eighties-style structure.</p><p>For the most part, though, this was one of Bradley's safer collections, and it should be a buyer's dream with its well-made separates, smart blouses, perfect pants, and tailored jackets. A bit more of the designer's usual high-concept drama wouldn't have gone amiss, but it was impossible not to like the gorgeous print dresses and other wearable items he sent out. Still, one of the best pieces, a seemingly simple strapless dress with back train, was also the most inventive: It was made out of a limited-edition shower curtain featuring a Lisa Yuskavage nude produced in conjunction with an indomitable ""Tuleh girl"" by the name of Yvonne Force Villareal.</p></div>"
155,spring,2007,s2007,undercover,"Jun Takahashi took a breathtaking leap into the realm of chic and pretty for spring. ""Undercover has been creatively a very dark thing,"" he said. ""Now I wanted to make something beautiful for girls—without any dark side."" Of course, Takahashi's move from hooded faces to absolute loveliness was executed with a sly touch. In a season of baby dolls, shirtdresses, nude-illusion paneling, pleating, glitter, fringing, and the return of sexiness, the designer took it all on, but—for the first time in this round of shows—articulated them with the authority of the young speaking to the young.</p><p>The soft and decorative techniques involved here—in short, flowy A-line ruffled georgette dresses, black tulle coats on lace shifts, plissé satin coats and fringed tunics over shorts—were stunning, especially from a Tokyo designer formerly categorized as a merchant of bobble-felted heavy-metal deconstruction. But that wasn't all. Added to the surge in Parisian finesse was a thoroughly convincing combination of eroticism and subversive playfulness. There were sheer panels floating over bras and lacy shorts, black stockings, and garters—stock come-on gear in other hands, but here they skewed cool. Why? You had to look even more closely to see the difference between Takahashi's girl and your normal leggy filly. Her cute bow tie is made of crossbones. Her glittery glove is fused onto her glittery clutch. Her necklace is a dog collar. And her extravagant evening cover-ups are smothered in satin whorls, made in the shape of skulls. Bravo. This is a collection that puts Takahashi firmly in the top rank of important new voices.</p></div>"
156,spring,2007,s2007,united-bamboo,"Change was in the air at Exit Art, where Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki presented their United Bamboo collection today. Gone was last season's post-modern hipster; in her place was <em>la garçonne</em>, jaunty in nautical stripes, bow-tied shirts, and golf sandals. (The men, in contrast, wore black velvet Mary Janes.) The collection had a touch of vintage, a touch of things <em>kawaii</em>, but remained fresh and true to the United Bamboo aesthetic. ""Everything we do is mashed up without being too obvious,"" offered Pham.</p><p>To a soundtrack by Panda Bear (a solo effort by Noah of Animal Collective, some of whose work is published on UUAR, United Bamboo's record label), the designers reprised fall's strong volumes, but in softer, more languid fabrics. A mariniere striped minidress had a front drape ""like a deflated balloon,"" as Pham described it. It didn't hit a flat note, though; this is a collection with a lot of buoyancy.</p></div>"
157,spring,2007,s2007,valentino,"His label might be just nine months shy of its forty-fifth birthday, but in a season when a buzz about ""lightness"" is in the air, Valentino proved he holds the franchise on old-school loveliness with as much authority as ever. Remarkably, his spring collection made some of the lifelong themes of his work—delicate dresses, lace, bows, and, of course, the color red—seem quite beautifully relevant at a time when so many edgier upstarts are stabbing around the territory.</p><p>Exhibits: a little ivory polka-dotted organza dress, with ripples of pristine frill running around the shoulders and throat; and a shapely scarlet strapless goddess gown, dramatically wrapped with an expertly knotted, flow-away georgette drape. Either of these, plunked in the middle of an emerging designer¿s collection, might be deemed trend-hitters, not to mention streets-ahead in terms of accomplishment. There was a reason this thought cropped up amongst the fragile sugar-pink and lavender chiffon, tiny puffed-shoulder sequin jackets, and multitude of prettily placed bow-motifs: The hair had turned modern, rather than lacquered and bouffed. It was just enough of a context change to make another generation stop giggling at the back and pay attention.</p><p>Even if hip kids aren¿t about to rush to Valentino right now, this presentation put down a marker for what the label could be in the future. There is no word about succession in this house—Valentino is still enjoying himself far too much—but any aspiring eye out there would do well to study the detail in this collection. Valentino¿s inimitable touch with pleating and ruffles—flat, accordion, tiered, fluttery, crisp, frisée-edged—was a kind of master class in the essence of this brand.</p></div>"
158,spring,2007,s2007,vena-cava,"Vena Cava was one of ten labels with a Spring 2007 show made possible by UPS, which sponsored a showcase for young designers in a special section of the Bryant Park tents. Unlike their fellow ""Hub"" dwellers, however, Vena Cava designers Lisa Mayock and Sophie Buhai opted for a presentation over a runway show, with a quirkily conceived setting that echoed the whimsy of their last outing. The four rooms that had been the conceit of their fall show were replaced this season by three lawns, peopled by groups of characters with names like ""the daydreamers"" and ""the misfits."" Charming, maybe, but not strictly practical: It's tricky to get a sense of what clothes look like when they're being worn by models lying prone on Astroturf. Nonetheless, there were pretty, wearable offerings, including a mauve dress with fringe details, an evening gown with a deconstructed seam, and a brown leather jacket lined in an original print—a Vena Cava signature. Only a small step forward from last season—most of that in the decorative details—but enough to keep the loyal fans happy.</p></div>"
159,spring,2007,s2007,vera-wang,"Today's lovely Vera Wang show made it clear why Kohl's courted the designer for two years and why she's poised to succeed in translating her vision to the moderate-priced clothes she'll design for its hundreds of department stores. Over the last few seasons Wang has expertly refined her signatures. You know a Vera jacket when you see it: the subtle sheen of the silk faille; the short, elbow-length sleeves; the blossoming volume below the bust; the rosette attached with offhand insouciance. She's a brand where other designers are collections of borrowed ideas.</p><p>That's not to say that she didn't evolve for spring. There was a new balletic quality to the clothes that went beyond the pink rehearsal bar at the entrance to the runway. She played with transparency, a big spring motif, by encasing the lower half of a dress in a bubble of tulle, shrouding a sequined camisole with net, and showing cropped chiffon pants under tunics. She also worked layers, tweaking, for instance, dressed-up gold brocade by tossing a black cotton chemise over it.</p><p>But what was really interesting was the way she brought her own simple style of dressing to bear on the proceedings. Wang loves a legging and a big sweater. Today she showed fine-gauge cardigans covetable in their cool simplicity and skinny pants that added a casual element the collection formerly lacked. Practice for the Very Vera line that hits Kohl's a year from now? Yes or no, it all looked beautiful.</p></div>"
160,spring,2007,s2007,veronique-branquinho,"A certain Northern reserve is characteristic of Veronique Branquinho's work, so it was a (mostly pleasant) surprise to find her jazzing things up for spring. Judy Garland's rendition of ""Over the Rainbow"" (as well as tracks by Elvis and the Bee Gees) were on the eclectic soundtrack; the models entered the Palais de la Porte Dorée space through sparkling beaded curtains; and there were tiered, beaded, and fringed jersey Charleston dresses on the runway. Tempered with Branquinho's customary restraint, these pieces worked. She also sent out Empire styles, and a standout ivory shift with a lyric fall at the back.</p><p>The decorative elements were balanced with the classics-with-a-twist Branquinho's customers crave. This season, she injected a sporty edge, meaning that a trench or a pin-striped Spencer jacket might be paired with a metallic, strapless A-line, or an oxford might top a pair of jogging pants. If the seventies-referencing knicker-length jumpsuits could have been edited out, the slouchy ""me era"" boots were a cool way to ground this dressier-than-usual outing.</p></div>"
161,spring,2007,s2007,versace,"Donatella Versace has a thing or two to teach the youngsters—and a few of the oldsters—about how to bring back the eighties. She hit that spot with a tour-de-force performance in the corsetry department of her show. First came a high-waist girdle-bikini, then boned basques set into liquid jersey, followed by shiny full-metal dresses with sharply faceted bras.</p><p>There's a difference, though, between flagging up a trend for the sake of a showstopper and making clothes a woman can put on without excruciating agony or ridicule. Versace solved that with technology: The robo-woman metal shards are actually plastic. On the body, they weigh nothing. With that, she sealed the collection with a well-wrought Versace stamp, glancing at the past, but reflecting forward into the now.</p><p>The rest of the show—which steered clear of eighties theming—reinforced the feeling that Donatella is moving things on. Having personally reached a point of clarity and good health, she is working Versace toward a new sense of reality. The daywear dealt out the current short cocoon shapes and Empire dresses in a pared-back way. Even the prints—wavy, oversized seventies graphics—seemed relatively restrained. Compared to the scattered and sometimes slapdash performances of past seasons, this looked like another step toward reclaiming authority for the house founded by Gianni Versace. The figures concur, and that's credit to the emergence of his sister's womanly point of view.</p></div>"
162,spring,2007,s2007,viktor-rolf,"You've got to love Viktor &amp; Rolf for their dedicated services to fashion week entertainment. For spring, they produced the full cabaret: Rufus Wainwright singing ""Over the Rainbow,"" a showtime orchestra, ballroom dancers, chandeliers, and champagne. It was a gorgeous performance—all girls two-stepping backward in Lucite-and-pink-satin platforms, and tuxedoed boys dancing cheek to cheek. What more could one desire in a fashion show? A little more consideration to the clothing. Seems churlish, but there it is.</p><p>Occasionally, as when Tori Amos did her gig on their stage, V&amp;R manage to combine artistic collaboration with an amazing, thought-provoking collection; this time the <em>Strictly Ballroom</em> theme didn't get to the same level. Star motifs, spangly nude inserts, and dance skirts are emerging as a Paris sub-theme, and Viktor &amp; Rolf had those. But these trends pose difficulties in the execution, and the duo's focus on the technicalities of tricky zigzag and starburst cutouts overrode any sensible outcome in terms of wearability. Their off-putting commitment to silk fringing—cascading over dresses and blouses, and smothering the whole of one pantsuit—led to an even more obvious snag. Snoeren and Horsting say they believe in fashion escapism, but when their garments might get a woman caught up in her closet-door handle, they've reached the limit.</p></div>"
163,spring,2007,s2007,vpl,"Victoria Bartlett's VPL began as a lingerie line, but the designer has been broadening her focus with every season. Spring saw her dive deeper into ready-to-wear, with a collection that was inspired by water, specifically the glaciers and waterfalls of Iceland. It followed that there were some overt nautical references: drawstring rope belts pulled through slightly bell-hemmed dresses; striped tops in a burst of orange. And bringing the point home was a splatter print. But the water theme was also worked organically through construction, via the use of round shapes, sequins with a raindrop gleam, and dresses with fabric cascading down the front, or a train that swished like a fishtail. Bartlett hasn't forgotten her line's origins, and spring featured a successful balance between innerwear and outerwear, as silky vintage tap pants were paired with sporty pieces like trapeze-back picot jackets. The collection remains difficult to categorize, but even without a clever finale featuring a parade of models under clear umbrellas, it's obvious that Bartlett isn't wet behind the ears.</p></div>"
164,spring,2007,s2007,wunderkind,"After two years in New York, Wolfgang Joop has brought his Wunderkind collection to Paris. ""In America, they were always telling me you have to be a little businesslike, a little sporty, a little realistic. Here, you have to follow your heart,"" he said. Well, it seems that Joop's heart is of two minds. The first look out—a two-piece, gray checked suit with slouchy pants—suggested he'd go the menswear route. From there, though, he layered on the flourishes, so that by the end it wasn't a surprise to see a long-coat-bikini top-and-cuffed-bloomers combination come in gold-leafed tablecloth lace. Most of the clothes were faded at the shoulders, an ombré patina effect Joop said he achieved by bleaching them in the sun in Italy. Many others were studded with brass grommets. When he put the two effects together, it was an embellishment overload. Better were the show's less tricky pieces: a belted black dress with broderie anglaise at the neckline and a navy silk suit with zips at the ankle that jibed with the sporty vibe starting to materialize on the runways; or washed-leather jackets with a snug, sexy fit. Beforehand, Joop hinted that his Paris debut had given him a case of the nerves. Nothing suggested that more than the show's misguided statement accessories: bonnets with peripheral-vision-obliterating brims. So much for New York's lesson in realism, indeed.</p></div>"
165,spring,2007,s2007,y-kei,"""The spirit of the spring collection is one of young couture,"" explained Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang, and their claim was borne out by the quality of both fabric and construction on display. White-on-white dresses featured intricate embroidery and appliqu¿éd lace, and the designers worked bows—their big idea for spring —into a lot of the clothing, integrating them into their pieces rather than treating them as embellishments. To counter the frill factor, Y &amp; Kei sent the models down the runway in Louise Brooks bobs (which, coincidentally, just happens to be the style a lot of the girls are wearing themselves this season). ""This way it is not all too pretty,"" they explained.</p><p>Pretty, however, is what Y &amp; Kei do, and this season they overdid it somewhat, with voluminous mille-feuille pleated blouses and soft dresses that at times suggested wedding cakes. In keeping with the feel of the season, the designers worked the pouf and the trapeze, most successfully in a series of pale coat-dresses and jackets in silk faille. Their ""double A"" silhouette—a trapeze jacket paired with a mini pleated-taffeta skirt—was just too much, but the saccharine factor was thankfully vanquished by a Victorian-style blouse of cotton lace and the elegant closing evening gowns.</p></div>"
166,spring,2007,s2007,y-3,"On the surface, it might not have seemed like an ideal marriage—the arch avant-gardist and the mainstream sporting-goods giant—but Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas are growing into happy bed-partners. His contract has just been extended to 2010, and with this show, it was clear why. Yamamoto, whose play with volume looked fresh for the first time in a while with the menswear he showed in Paris in July, continued the roll at Pier 40 today, sending out a strong Y-3 collection against a money-no-object backdrop of neon-lit barges, moving walkways, and major celebrities.</p><p>The palette—black, white, navy, orange—was one of his own design signatures. So was the Edwardiana, incongruous in this context and all the more interesting for that. From the opener in asymmetrical black and white to the closing floor-sweeping tank dress, which looked like an ideal outfit for a day at the beach circa 1905, Yamamoto reiterated his idiosyncratic vision of the way a woman might like to conceal—or reveal—her body. This embraced everything from tiny, fitted tops to floor-length wrap skirts. A tank paired with baggy trousers hanging from black-and-white-striped suspenders was a good example of the way he is able to hone the fashionable urban edge on Adidas' sportswear. And he brought the whole kit and caboodle up to this century with a computerized floral print and a passage of outfits in a superstretch fabric that demanded nothing less than hyperathleticism. Yamamoto clearly knows that keeping things fresh is the secret to a happy marriage.</p></div>"
167,spring,2007,s2007,yigal-azrouel,"Over the past few seasons, Yigal Azrouël has redefined his aesthetic, jettisoning the too-proper occasion wear of yore and developing a feel for day dressing. For his spring show, presented at Bumble and bumble, the designer took a pair of classics—the white shirt and the tee—and twisted, tucked, draped, and layered them into covetable tough-chic staples that were worn with shrunken leather jackets and cropped drainpipes zippered at the ankle.</p><p>Evening was about flat-out glamour. There were short, slightly bubble-hemmed minis for the leggy set, and gowns of cascading fabric, in sand, ink, and black, that could be read as markers of this designer's progress.</p></div>"
168,spring,2007,s2007,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto's abiding interest in men's attire showed no sign of flagging on his spring runway, although the masses of oversized suits have thankfully disappeared. In their place was a focus on transparency. This reintroduced a welcome dose of sensuality to the proceedings, even if it didn't quite make up for a certain overall slackness.</p><p>Yamamoto started things off with an unreconstructed men's look: tailcoat, full pants in banker's stripes, and a starchy white shirt with a black band around its high collar. From there, he traded in those trousers for long, sheer skirts and that stiff shirt for blouses or diminutive bibs traced with delicate floral embroidery. Along similar masculine-feminine lines, Yamamoto cut a jacket's front panels in flannel and the back in chiffon—that's one way to stay cool in the heat of the summer.</p><p>Among the show's best pieces were a pair of apron dresses with pleats falling from the bodice, where they twisted to resemble fresh blooms. They served as a reminder of the heights this designer has reached with ruffles. The abbreviated finale, in which he sent out only a half-dozen girls, all in subtle variations of that first men's suit, more than confirmed his rep as a consummate tailor, but those girlish frills made you long for the days when Yamamoto really let rip with his couturemanship.</p></div>"
169,spring,2007,s2007,zac-posen,"Before his show, Zac Posen said that his jackets and suits have surpassed dresses in sales—but as it turned out, he didn't follow the money for spring. Yes, there were some strong-shouldered blazers and high-waisted pants, plus a sailor jacket with a tulip skirt, but the focus here was on his first passion, evening. Exhibit A: an emerald-green bias-cut silk column inspired by his beloved 1930s that was drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>Posen, however, is not a one-dress kind of guy. Instead, he wandered giddily—a little too giddily, at times—across the after-dark map. A thigh-grazing showgirl number with an explosion of peonies at the hem and a ballooning gown cut from what he playfully called ""Esther Williams jacquard"" were two of the show's extremes. But there were plenty of other big statements in between, some more successful (navy silk with fringe below the knees; a bubble dress in shocking pink) than others (the over-the-top red gown with an outsized sash protruding from the back, for starters). A tighter edit wouldn't have hurt. On the other hand, there are a lot of red carpets to stroll down these days, and the Eves, Emmys, and Kates in his front row want to arrive in something that hasn't been photographed on everyone else. That's why Posen's their man.</p></div>"
170,spring,2007,s2007,zero-maria-cornejo,"With the Cooper-Hewitt Design Award in the bag, Maria Cornejo moved her show from the confines of her tiny NoLIta shop to Bumble and bumble's Meatpacking District salon. As the sun streamed in through the big south-facing windows, she showed a deceptively simple spring collection that confirmed she deserved her prize. Continuing to explore the theme that's occupied her throughout her career—simple geometric shapes and the way they drape on the body—she added novelty in the form of industrial zippers as well as broad bands from which falls of knit jersey and gauzy cotton were draped. They gave the mostly soft, sculptural collection a tough, chic edge. Shoulders were a focal point: A black silk dress and blouse came with circles cut out there, while other coats looked built up in that area. It took a moment for the eye to adjust to the new proportion, but it's those intriguing details that give Cornejo's clothes their appeal.</p></div>"
171,spring,2007,s2007,3-1-phillip-lim,"Phillip Lim's first-ever runway presentation got off to a frustrating start when an eager crowd had to wait in the near dark to gain access to their seats. But all was forgiven once his lovely show began. Working almost exclusively in white, with a few shots of navy, as well as a colorful floral, the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist proved that he's not only a romantic—handmade rosettes decorated a T-shirt dress—but also an accomplished tailor. Lim can do simple, as demonstrated by a pair of high-waisted, pleated slacks, but he can also do complex: the crepe de chine blouse paired with those pants came with delicate sleeves of pleated tulle.</p><p>Lim has a knack for combining the dressy and the casual—take a cotton voile strapless bell dress paired with a men's leather pilot vest, for instance; or a girlish jumper with an attached bodice made of sequins. Is it day or evening? His clients couldn't care less. More so than most young designers working today, Lim knows how fashionable women want to dress.</p></div>"
172,spring,2007,s2007,6267,"After winning <em>Vogue Italia</em>'s young-designer competition last year—an initiative to seed the next generation of Dolce &amp; Gabbanas and Alessandro Dell'Acquas—Roberto Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano of 6267 took to the runway for their third show. Still, even with such prime exposure, it takes time for the identity of a new line to properly coalesce. What 6267 presented this season was a slightly hard-edged take on the ubiquitous dress-over-trousers look. Their spin was to add a layering of twenties flapper influences, putting bugle-beaded, dippy-hemmed tunics under jackets and over skinny, ankle-cropped pants. The designers followed that conceit into slouchy, hip-slung, satin dresses—some were a tad too Milano-disco, but a couple worked fine. It was the tailoring, though, that in the end looked most promising. Cutting a mean jacket is a skill that few young designers have down, and these two might be smart to press that advantage further.</p></div>"
1,fall,2007,f2007,a-f-vandevorst,"Lingerie and fur are the twin passions of Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst, and they vied for attention on the duo's Fall runway. Starting things off was a deceptively plain shirt with gussets at the breasts tied together with tiny, provocative bows. A red dress was wantonly sliced in front to expose flashes of white satin brassiere, the strap of which poked through a horizontal slit in back. And a narrow sheath was draped from black floral lace, which was also used for an evening shawl and leggings. Some of this veered toward the overcomplicated, but the same couldn't be said of the show's outerwear.</p><p>Shaggy lamb vests, trenches, and wraps—some patchworked together from squares with naps of different thicknesses—felt cool and completely of the moment, as did the fur hoods with scarf flaps attached. Easy calico dresses with short sleeves edged in the fluffy stuff looked signature and very original, and almost wholesome in comparison to the kinky boudoir touches. Somewhere in the middle were the narrow, hooded blanket-plaid capes: Who knows what sort of delectations were hidden beneath their ankle-grazing shapes?</p></div>"
2,fall,2007,f2007,abaete,"Laura Poretzky initially launched her Abaeté line in 2003 as a collection of swimsuits and resortwear inspired by childhood summers spent on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro. Since then, the designer's contemporary label has been growing up. For Fall, her fourth ready-to-wear season at Bryant Park, Poretzky offered up a Courrèges-inspired mod look in the form of zippered and color-blocked shift dresses and patent leather coats. It's a tried-and-true motif and one that Poretzky has previously explored, which made for a slightly predictable and occasionally repetitive show. Nevertheless, in a market hungry for dresses, those familiar silhouettes should easily find a customer. And there will be plenty more fans lining up for the similarly mod-themed bags and shoes, designed by Poretzky for Payless. It's a collaboration that is now in its third season and one that, according to the designer, will continue for a few more, no doubt providing an invaluable boost of brand recognition.</p></div>"
3,fall,2007,f2007,adam-lippes,"Adam Lippes' Fall collection embraced the sporty collegiate life—a theme familiar to those who've been following his line. Cozy cable-knit sweaters—enormous, and thick as duvets—were paired with slouchy tweed coats or a shrunken rain slicker. A wool trench with a tie-dye effect would make a cool cover-up for day or night, on- or off-campus. The rebel might be drawn to a patent-trimmed, cropped jacket or a gathered sack dress studded with brass spheres; the party girl would favor the cocktail dresses, particularly the black taffeta bubble with sequin trim or the triple-tiered plissé mini with glittery dots. While Lippes' vision remains fixed, his execution and materials have climbed to a higher level. Now let's hope for some deviation from the schoolgirl theme in the future.</p></div>"
4,fall,2007,f2007,akris,"Herzog &amp; de Meuron, the visionary Swiss architects, were on Albert Kriemler's mind this season. The silvery high-tech ""skin"" of the Walker Art Center was interpreted as a georgette-covered metallic shrug, and San Francisco's new de Young could be seen in the sequins scattered over a black slip dress. Some of the more obvious building motifs, like the severe suede wedges and the 3-D cubes superimposed on large-gauge knits, looked clunky rather than light. But the theme was generally a good match for this designer's spare, precise sensibility and his strength as a tailor.</p><p>Kriemler delivered in the suit department, showing sharp, lean cuts in charcoal gray, sometimes with a minimalist ring of ruffles decorating the hem of a putty vest. Jackets were cinched with a polished stainless-steel belt for a slightly futuristic touch. And the interesting surfaces on the coats turned them into the highlight of the show. Crushed aluminum made a cocoon shape modern, while leather made a cropped anorak deluxe. Parkas were taken apart and rebuilt as evening toppers, a trick clever enough to even impress Jacques and Pierre back in Basel.</p></div>"
5,fall,2007,f2007,alberta-ferretti,"Whisking away the drapey jersey and pin-tucked chiffons of her Spring collection like so much fluff, Alberta Ferretti came out strong for Fall. Given the less-is-more direction in which fashion seems to be heading, it was perfect timing. She¿ll never be a minimalist, of course, so the smart pea jacket that opened the show came with puff sleeves, while a V-neck dress had a flaring hourglass shape that shaded from dove gray at the bodice to charcoal at the knee. Coats were potent, too. If their inspirations were retro, their lines were reproportioned to look new. One princess silhouette was decorated with a warm sunset print. Glossy leathers were studded, as is the trend this season.</p><p>Ferretti is a designer who truly gets evening, satisfying both the desire for ornament and the less glamorous, but no less important, need for ease. Despite all of the pretty embellishments (cocktail dresses with gold sequins arrayed in Art Deco geometries or feathers aligned in horizontal stripes), there wasn¿t a lot of trickery. And as for the red carpet, get those gowns on a plane, pronto! Especially the ice-blue number aswirl with ruched chiffon, and the strapless black coupe de velour: The Oscars are only half a week away.</p></div>"
6,fall,2007,f2007,alessandro-dell-acqua,"It was a case of trend overload at Alessandro Dell'Acqua. The show opened with a neoprene parka lined in long-haired fur that suggested he was about to take off in a sporty new direction; also on the sporty side were hyper-fitted puffer jackets that came tucked under or into dresses and skirts constructed from Hervé Léger-esque bandages (which, rather randomly, also accented sweaters and knit vests). But Dell'Acqua was only getting started. There was also a remix of last season's metallics, which were draped into a goddess minidress…and a dash of futurism, in the form of space-age silver quilting…and don't forget the designer's signature lingerie stylings: Cocktail numbers were spliced with lace or veiled with nude chiffon. A few white girdles somehow made it out onto the runway, too.</p><p>As is often the case, the most successful pieces were the simplest—say a cocooning gray coat embellished only with elbow patches. The designer—who took his bow to Pat Benatar's <em>Love Is a Battlefield</em>—clearly had the new eighties power babe in mind, and the collection did tap into this season's tough-chic vibe. The trouble is, he seemed to take his ideas from every place but his own imagination to get there.</p></div>"
7,fall,2007,f2007,alexander-mcqueen,"In a season when the agendas of fashion are finally being rewritten, all a professional audience really comes to Paris for is to witness brilliant designers working on modern cut for twenty-first-century life—and to inspect it in close-up. Even on a Friday night, in rain and heavy weekend traffic, they will drag themselves to an inhospitable sports venue at the ends of the Périphérique to see an Alexander McQueen show with just those expectations. Unfortunately, the audience was confronted with a distracting, overwrought show that only succeeded in ramming home the realization that the theatrics and stadium-sized presentations of the nineties are—or rather should be—a thing of the past.</p><p>To be fair, McQueen had put a heartfelt personal passion into a collection that was based on a startling revelation from his family history. His mother, who traces family trees, discovered that her bloodline leads back to a victim of the Salem witch trials who was hanged in the Puritan hysteria of 1692. The themes of witchcraft, paganism, and religious persecution played on the dark and angry side of McQueen's creativity, but the way he articulated them ultimately ended in one of the season's most deleterious cases of concept overwhelming clothes.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>First of all, there was a pentagram traced in red in a black-sand circle, with an inverted pyramid hanging over it. As the show started, a macabre film—of naked women, swarming locusts, faces decaying to skulls, and blood and fire—started to play above the models' heads. Theoretically, no one objects to being disturbed and discomforted by a pointed McQueen performance—it's an accepted part of his identity. What they did object to was that the point was lost in the distractions, and what interesting clothes did emerge could barely be appreciated at the distance he put between models and audience.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""sanqwn""></div></div><p>The clothes were there, as far as it was possible to see. The opening of the show proved McQueen is thinking about new shape, in this case pod-like structures that broke the mold of his usual corseted silhouette. The volumes, shown over black leather leggings, moved toward a curved-back, forward-facing shape that put him somewhere in line with other experiments that are going on in Paris. McQueen's research on religion had found links between ancient Egypt and the folk culture of the earliest British immigrants to the New World, so there were Nefertiti hairdos and couture-detailed clothes fashioned to mimic the lapis lazuli and gold of sarcophagi. One blue dyed fur was shaved and shaded like overlapping feathers, and a gilded column and green jersey gown with coiled snakes at the breast looked fit for Elizabeth Taylor starring as Cleopatra.</p><p>After that, though, it swiftly became a bumpy and difficult ride. Quieter pieces like a cardigan dress, a nipped-waist parka, and a shearling skirt (core items that sell so well for McQueen) got drowned by the gore flowing on the screens. At the end, there were some of the gowns he is so good at—a trail of emerald velvet with copper bugle-beaded strands of hair spilling to the waist, and a chic black silver-beaded gown that rippled from the shoulder line as it moved. Still, even those didn't have the power to fill the space or to placate an audience driven to the end of its tolerance by an experience that—journey and waiting-in-the-dark time included—took four hours. McQueen is too talented to get stuck in an outdated habit of presentation like this.</p></div>"
8,fall,2007,f2007,alexander-wang,"For his second full ready-to-wear show, Alexander Wang focused on a combination of eighties hip-hop and seventies Parisian chic, channeling Run-D.M.C. and YSL simultaneously. As unlikely a mix as those influences are, Wang managed to pull off a modern and polished, not to mention commercially viable, collection.</p><p>A dense crowd turned up at an abandoned Hell's Kitchen warehouse to applaud slim cropped-at-the-ankle leather pants with a hint of biker about them and a silk crepe T-shirt dress studded at the hem. The green matte-paillette shirtdress or the pleated gray silk strapless number would be fun for a party-girl night out, paired with a little fur jacket for Uptown or an olive anorak for Down. Wang, who first made his name with his line of cashmere knits, is off to a strong start.</p></div>"
9,fall,2007,f2007,alexandre-herchcovitch,"It's not often that a designer can send a bona fide garbage bag down his runway and make it work. But such was the curious beauty behind Alexandre Herchcovitch's fall show. The designer drew his inspiration from the highly resourceful manner in which the indigent plantation and mine workers of his native Brazil dress themselves. It could easily have devolved into parody, but Herchcovitch's third look out—a white pointelle shirtdress crafted out of Tyvek—made you believe that he could pull it off.</p><p>The theme played out in clothes that were pieced together from different materials, ostensibly found scraps. Jumpsuits-cum-overalls came in a mélange of satin, vinyl, and wool, with the back pockets of a former pair of pants falling somewhere around mid-calf. That garbage bag came in a few variations, one smartly fashioned into a paper bag-waisted skirt topped with a floral jacquard jacket.</p><p>While the above-mentioned items were unabashedly ""high concept,"" Herchcovitch also managed to work in wearability in pretty, printed sack dresses, especially one in a diamond patchwork. And who knows—as the designer is opening his first boutique in fashion-obsessed Tokyo next month, he could well have a customer for that Hefty frock.</p></div>"
10,fall,2007,f2007,alice-roi,"For fall, Alice Roi cited the spunky children's-book heroine Madeline as her inspiration, but the schoolgirl who walked the runway was a darker version of the original 1930s merry mischief-maker. Show notes referred to such mental and physical misfortunes as ""broken thoughts,"" night sweats, fractures, and sutures. Translation: A mix of the innocent (a toggle coat, Peter Pan collars, a shimmering floral brocade dress) and the subversive (bat-print silk tees, asymmetrically draped skirts, racy, second-skin knit minidresses). From all this, what will Roi's customer find to wear? Not the clunky wool layered skirts and yeti-like mohair pieces, which might in fact induce night sweats. More covetable were the windowpane trousers and a perfect, fluid, black silk dress with a metallic-trimmed ruffled flourish.</p></div>"
11,fall,2007,f2007,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"The provocations with which Vivienne Westwood once surprised fashion have now become the norm. You can see, for instance, her draped and twisting silhouettes with their unusual volumes in the Japanese collections. The assimilations have sapped some of the shock value from her shows, but they haven¿t dampened her enthusiasm.</p><p>In addition to those swirling and bunching shapes—this season shown snapped together (and racily unsnapped) like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle—she reprised such favorites as the corset and the exaggerated, squared-off shoulder. A Fall trend, the bolder shoulder was achieved here with padded harnesses that, when they came in gold brocade, made believable substitutes for evening boleros. Also on-message were the big knit furs and blown-out plaids.</p><p>It¿s more difficult to explain how the cave-drawing prints and intarsias fit in, other than to say that she loves a doodle and that she had seen fit to name the show ""Wake Up, Cave Girl."" But then, without a few oddball elements like those (or a bit of sideshow, like the band of supporters in the audience sporting fake-fur loincloths and wielding golden clubs), she wouldn¿t be Westwood, would she?</p></div>"
12,fall,2007,f2007,andrew-gn,"With Marisa Berenson sitting front-row in a red, rock-crystal-strewn Andrew Gn linen coat, the designer sent out looks extravagant even by his own lavish standards—a Fall collection that¿s sure to send Berenson and the rest of his loyal ladies rushing to his private atelier.</p><p>Inspired by the early twentieth-century architect Josef Hoffmann and the interior designer Armand-Albert Rateau, the clothes had a Belle Époque opulence and a twenties shape—witness the feather-dusted frayed-organza capelets, the satin tunics and drop-waist numbers with jeweled necklines, and a bubble dress embroidered with fringes of gold chain.</p><p>The couture details came fast and furious: velvet passementerie on a kimono coat, a Byzantine jewel closure on a cardigan (to match the model¿s drop earrings), and tiny pheasant-feather collars on tweeds. There were bags, too: minaudières and exotic skins that the designer is launching in collaboration with Judith Leiber. And there were 12-ply funnel-neck cashmere sweaters, anything but understated.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qya9yh""></div></div><p>It¿s a matter of course that Gn, a lover of excess, should have a tough time paring down the looks in his show, but—for all but his most faithful fans—a briefer lineup would make for a bigger impact.</p></div>"
13,fall,2007,f2007,ann-demeulemeester,"Some might complain that Ann Demeulemeester never changes, but her most ardent fans—arty types who could clock the Kara Walker reference on one of her graphic prints at 20 paces—would argue right back that the naysayers are simply not paying close enough attention. There was a billowy new volume to the hems of jackets and shirts layered over reliably cool trousers, some of them tucked into knee-high boots. Call it a bubble, and a major development for the dark queen of slouch. And those were sequins covering a pair of her signature vests. The collection had even lighter moments, too, like an ivory duster and a white tail coat with contrasting trim, and the models' matching powdered 'dos.</p><p>But no, Demeulemeester hasn't abandoned black. She used it as a layering device (ribbed knits worn under waistcoats and below floaty tops of tulle) and as an accent (see the oversize lamb mufflers). She knows her way around a shaggy fur, which makes Fall her moment. Of the scores seen on the runways these last few weeks, her vest, longer in front than back, stands out. Why? Years of practice.</p></div>"
14,fall,2007,f2007,anna-molinari,"At Anna Molinari, Rosella Tarabini clearly got the Milanese-trend memo about keeping it tough, dark, short, and, at all possible times, belted. That might seem like a bit of a volte-face for a label known not long ago for peachy chiffon fairy dresses, but recently this collection has been edging toward a hipper, younger vibe, and so today's mood shift didn't seem too egregiously out of character (which is more than can be said for several other houses in this city).</p><p>Some of it, admittedly, was down to styling: the military caps as well as the black tights, platforms, and long gloves that are cropping up in so many places. But Tarabini managed to inject enough personality into enough of the things she showed to differentiate her collection from all the others that currently feature laundry lists of black high-belted dresses and coats, egg-shaped skirts, and black patent. Tarabini's strengths: a naughty-schoolgirl black knife-pleat skirt in patent, a high-necked A-line coat, and, most credibly, her contribution to the knit revival that's becoming noticeable this season. Hers were fine-gauge sweater dresses in multidirectional stripes, with a skimpy roughness that made them seem like the kind of thing a young girl really might want to wear—a welcome contrast to the gargantuan quadruple-knit fantasies that have appeared on some other runways and that look frankly ridiculous in the midst of the world's global-warming crisis.</p></div>"
15,fall,2007,f2007,anna-sui,"Were those curtain swags decorating the hem of a minidress? As a matter of fact, yes. Backstage at her show, Anna Sui explained that she began working on Fall by looking at pre-Pop Andy Warhol and other commercial artists, and that afterward she became interested in interiors. ""I put all of my favorite objects into the prints,"" she said. So, bits of furniture decorated a silk charmeuse dress, newspaper print showed up on a crepe de chine number, and wool knits came appliquéd with sewing notions.</p><p>As a concept, Victorian chairs aren't as compelling as, say, Marie Antoinette at a New York Dolls concert (one theme from last season). And as a collection, it didn't have the same spunk as some of Sui's earlier efforts. But there's always something to like in the designer's magpie piles of coats, sweaters, and frocks. Lacquered-silk anoraks layered under smocks or jumpers gave the show a sportier than usual edge. A pair of black lace party dresses—worn, in keeping with the trend, over fitted turtlenecks—looked like winners. And her silver-fox patchwork coat was so chic that even those furniture tassels could be forgiven.</p></div>"
16,fall,2007,f2007,anne-klein,"Anne Klein was a pioneer of American sportswear who, in the seventies, pushed the idea (it's hard to believe it was ever rebellious) of mix-and-match separates for a workforce of women heading to the office in Charlie, and to Elaine's in a blazer and slacks.</p><p>This season marked the debut of the much-admired Isabel Toledo as the designer of the brand with the lion's-head logo, and there was a palpable feeling of goodwill in the room. If the collection didn't come out roaring, it did purr along apace, with solid pieces like a navy cashmere cardigan with an asymmetrical closure and a camel robe coat.</p><p>The Klein DNA was most directly obvious in a suede tunic and pant. Toledo's concept for Fall was ""couture haberdashery,"" and it was well captured by several pleated dresses and a red cord coat-dress with a peplum. The sophistication of these looks perhaps spoke more to Toledo's own refined aesthetic than to Klein's more emphatically casual one. ""I feel like a scientist in a lab,"" Toledo joked of her alchemical attempts to create new Anne Klein gold. Her debut can be seen as a useful experiment, with the promise of new invention to come.</p></div>"
17,fall,2007,f2007,antonio-berardi,"Last season's angelic interlude seems to have left Antonio Berardi in the mood for sin. The power babes who strode his runway today wore charcoal-gray, superskinny, high-waisted pants with just a shade more structure than leggings, and sharp-shouldered jackets cropped to display curve-enhancing vests. High-tech fabrics circled the shoulders and stretched taut across the models' torsos like modern armor, almost bringing to mind a policeman's protective Kevlar gear. There were hints of Alaïa in the girdled waists, but Berardi also took the concept in a softer direction, accenting the hourglass shape of dresses with fagoting at strategic intervals near the bust and hips.</p><p>But whereas the beginning of the show celebrated and intensified the female form, what followed went in a different direction and was a bit of a letdown by comparison. Milk-white dresses with biblike bodices made from built-up geometric layers of wool and spliced skirts molded to form wide bubble hems ignored and disguised the natural shapes beneath. The program notes referenced Brancusi, but the effect was more artificial, almost robotic—a theme reinforced by the poured-plastic back of another dress and the show's shiny patent half-moon necklaces. Bottom line: When Berardi tempered his tendency to overembellish and overwork things, he and his clothes were at their sexy best.</p></div>"
18,fall,2007,f2007,aquascutum,"Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler riffed on Aquascutum's soldiering history for Fall. The company made officer's uniforms as far back as the Crimean War (as well as ""trench"" coats in WWI, of course). It didn't turn out to be an aggressively militaristic collection, though. Inspired by <em>The Nutcracker</em>, the designers said they ended up thinking more about toy soldiers, which explained the capes, military jackets with oversized frogging and toggles, and the little medals hanging from dress straps.</p><p>Still, anyone can come up with a catchy theme. The test of true design drive is whether the execution takes the material somewhere else; equally important is whether idea and execution merge to apply to a believable customer. Herz and Fidler's jackets and short coats ticked both of those boxes. Minutely quilted wool and silk numbers with slight standaway volumes had a grown-up sophistication, while waterproof anoraks in color-blocked black, cream, and mustard had a sporty zip.</p><p>If they're clever, the Aquascutum duo has the potential to appeal simultaneously to traditional customers as well as to a fashion fiend who just might be tempted by a scarlet jacket that seems to be made of painted feathers (it was a jagged cotton and plastic, in fact). And that seems to be the direction the designers are safely headed in now.</p></div>"
19,fall,2007,f2007,badgley-mischka,"Who would¿ve thought the day would come when jeans strutted down a Badgley Mischka runway? But there they were, tight as a glove and worn with cropped sable and Persian lamb jackets. And there was plenty more strong sportswear where those pieces came from, ensuring that the duo¿s celebrity faithful should be well-dressed in their non-red-carpet moments come fall. The youthful glen-plaid dress worn over a camel turtleneck that opened the show would suit Rachel Bilson, and a standaway-collar tweed jacket with matching high-waisted pants would make a sophisticated addition to the closet of her seatmate Amber Tamblyn.</p><p>The show¿s strapless velvet cocktail numbers, however, could¿ve used a few more inches at the hem, and the combined inspirations of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>, which informed the moody platinum-gray palette, and India¿s jeweled embroideries made for some overwrought evening dresses. Still, a few of the more understated sparklers did stand out: A vibrant violet chiffon gown with hematite embroidery at the high neckline, for one, was a surefire entrance-maker. In the end, the collection might¿ve benefited from a stricter edit, but nonetheless it hit some of the season¿s important notes.</p></div>"
20,fall,2007,f2007,balenciaga,"""It's a big mix—a street mix, with symbols and colors that are very multicultural,"" said Nicolas Ghesquière at the Balenciaga rehearsal an hour before the show. Then Led Zeppelin kerranged on the sound track, the girls started loping by, and he grinned, ""It's like in your room, on campus. It's about how girls become themselves."" In other words, this was Balenciaga brought back to the realm of the casual and young, but still just as layered, complex, and resonant as any Ghesquière projection into sci-fi.</p><p>Well, what does that mean? Practically speaking, clothes to wear—as simple as a tight little peak-shoulder jacket, a pair of narrow jodhpur-ish pants, a college-girl scarf wound up high, and killer athletic-techno sandals (some colored as brightly as Legos). Or, as the alternative choice, a mixed-print patchwork dress. As a look, it all hung together with a clarity that doesn't take a master's degree to understand. Still, there was enough to study in there to make a complete thesis on Ghesquière's ability to relate what he's doing to his past body of work and then to add to it, bit by bit, without ever saying the same thing twice.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>Using multiethnic fabric references—Eastern European folk embroideries, ikat, kimono, and African, Peruvian, Mongolian, and Balinese patterns—is a tricky business if you want to articulate something cool that hasn't been done by everyone else. But Ghesquière has his own conceptual compass—it was set when he used a Palestinian scarf in one of his early collections, and it turned up this time in a different print, elaborated with gold fringe, as a takeoff point for the fluttery multipieced dresses, as well as the sculpted peplum jackets at the end of the show. As a counterbalance, there were all the traditional Western roots in the jackets: English men's tailoring in green velvet smoking-jacket tail coats, Tyrolean boiled wool dyed magenta, boating-blazer stripes, and, lastly, bouclé tweeds of the sort associated with Chanel (though Ghesquière notes that Balenciaga was neck and neck with Coco on that).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""0l27eh""></div></div><p>Suffice to say, it is a major achievement to make all of that coherent while also producing a collection that isn't overly prescriptive, locked into a head-to-toe look. When all's said, the real cleverness of this show wasn't even in its impressive levels of intellect or craft: It's in the fact that so many women will be able to reach in, grab a jacket or a towering pair of Balenciaga heels, and make them work with whatever else they own.</p></div>"
21,fall,2007,f2007,balmain,"Christophe Decarnin struck this season's come-hither/don't-mess-with-me tone smack on the head. The temptress part of his mixed message came courtesy of the thigh-grazing dresses that have become a house motif since its relaunch a year ago; these are now more fitted through the waist, with the help of eighties-Alaïa cinching girdles. The tough-chic element came via silver armor embroidery at the neckline of a sequined number, metal coils at the shoulder of a short white frock, and a swooping cape of feathers that attached around the neck with a rope of shining crystals. Metal studs on suede platform booties completed the picture.</p><p>Decarnin has made this collection a strictly after-dark affair, and his work has a decidedly more louche tone than the ultra-elegant one that was Pierre Balmain's signature. But he did chivalrously show some pants alongside all the minidresses and the strapless goddess styles with slits coursing up the thighs. His low-slung bumsters clung to every inch of the models' legs from their backsides on down to the mid-calf, where they flared out in big swooshes of fabric to the soles of their platforms. You couldn't call them practical, but they were certainly bristling with swaggering attitude.</p></div>"
22,fall,2007,f2007,bcbg-max-azria,"There have been big changes in the Azria empire over the past year. A more luxurious niche line called Max Azria was spun off last fall. And—as the company brass tells it—even the long-familiar contemporary line, BCBG Max Azria, is a wholly new incarnation these days, one that's only in its second season. To clear any lingering confusion, Lubov Azria (wife of Max) attempted to define the two collections in terms that fashion folk could more easily digest: ""The BCBG Max Azria girl is Sienna Miller or Kate Moss,"" she explained backstage before the show. ""Max Azria is more Cate Blanchett.""</p><p>While the Azrias did have a front-row smattering of socialites (Fabiola Beracasa, Olivia Palermo, Bettina Zilkha, and Byrdie Bell), neither Sienna nor Kate was anywhere in sight. No matter: It was clear that the raffish, magpie style of those British It girls was being mined on the runway. And yes, you could imagine Sienna pulling on a pair of tights and grabbing BCBG's smoke-chiffon trapeze dress, topped with a cream knitted-fur vest, for a winter's night out. And Moss could certainly put to good use one of the hooded jackets, particularly the version in a stylishly crinkled cotton. There were also the sort of swingy frocks with a touch of detail that are bound to appeal to the BCBG customer, though the dresses were occasionally weighed down with copious amounts of appliqué, crocheted trim, and chains. It's hard to imagine any girl, It or not, opting to look quite so tricked out.</p></div>"
23,fall,2007,f2007,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour's moody collection left many in the crowd scratching their heads, wondering if they understood exactly what the designer was trying to say. Tough chic? Goth? Minimal? For those aware of Sarafpour's modern medieval inspiration, it could be argued that most looks theoretically pertained to the theme at hand. But abstract concepts can only take clothing so far, and there was little to help square such wildly disparate elements as a gray T-shirt dress with sporty yellow zips, a goth black velvet gown, and a luxurious but ho-hum cashmere trench. Along the way, Sarafpour offered occasional glimpses of why her show is always a draw for starlets and socialites, this season including Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Jamee Gregory. A black chemise with lantern sleeves and a neckline embellished with hammered metal, for instance, captured her youthful slant on uptown chic. But it wasn't enough to sustain the sweetness and light that we've come to expect from this young talent.</p></div>"
24,fall,2007,f2007,betsey-johnson,"Sending out invitations slipped into pairs of white gloves and lining her runway with tables set for tea, Betsey Johnson established a ""School of Charm"" for her latest show. Could this really be the same designer whose cheeky antics have included those ""GUYS ♥ B.J."" tees? Apparently so. ""Fall is more elegant, refined—more grown-up,"" the perennial teenager said. ""We have to be more about the cake than the icing.""</p><p>Of course, Betsey wanted to have her cake and eat it, too. Her prototypical sex-bomb baby still strode the catwalk in a suit with pinup short shorts, and any number of blowsy (okay, to be frank, tarty) dresses. Meanwhile, the more mature—if not strictly demure—minx dressed the part in formfitting frocks with a whisper of Dietrich, and a really pretty brown blouse with white polka dots, paired with a suspendered pinstripe skirt in a length that Johnson evocatively described as ""longer, leaner, and more swayable.""</p></div>"
25,fall,2007,f2007,biba,"It seemed a prescient move to bring back the Biba label two seasons ago. It resurfaced heavy seventies platforms just before anyone had gotten into them, and it proposed balloon-sleeved jersey dresses and silver lamé long-line cardigans before fashion turned in that direction. Trouble is, by now every mass-market retailer is churning out so many 60th-generation Biba ideas that the label's whole reason for being has been undermined.</p><p>The Fall runway didn't give any evidence that the mother brand had thought of a way to save this situation. The flippy minidresses, ankle-grazing maxi coats, and cropped-flare mod suits looked like the kind of thing that's already overavailable in fast-fashion chains. Besides that, the presentation was amateurish and sloppy, especially in a week in which young independents have upped the ante in terms of polish and discipline. The desultory way the models stopped short before the end of the runway seemed a metaphor for the low energy behind the collection. If the designer, Bella Freud, wants to compete, she'll have to first improve the fabrics, and then slick up the way Biba shows.</p></div>"
26,fall,2007,f2007,bill-blass,"Things are looking up at Bill Blass. Angelina Jolie wore clingy, spicy-red Blass on the cover of the January <em>Vogue</em>, and the company celebrated the launch of the new Blass fragrance during fashion week.</p><p>Did the Fall collection live up to the moment? For the most part, yes. Michael Vollbracht didn't reinvent the wheel, but he was in good form and the energy was up, up, up, with Johnny Dynell's remix of Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" bounding from the loudspeakers.</p><p>Having struck gold with Jolie's red jersey, it isn't surprising Vollbracht put out more knit dresses for autumn; one, a burgundy-and-camel color-block worn by Freja Beja Erichsen, had a timely eighties vibe. (A quick gripe here, however: Some of these knits would have worked better if they had hit someplace other than over the knee; and <em>all</em> of them would have worked better worn with something other than matronly flesh-colored tights. Odd legwear has been a problem at too many shows this week.) Still, there was plenty for the retailer and the customer to crave: a forest-green corduroyed-mink coat, a sable-lined silk anorak, and a pinstriped suit with just the right insouciance. A strapless black satin evening gown would be perfect for opening night at the American Ballet Theater.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""bzl6w""></div></div><p>Vollbracht's best effort, though, was a series of slithery mermaid dresses, done according to a technique borrowed from the great American master Norman Norell, who made a hit with his liquid sequined mermaids in the fifties (worn to memorable effect by Marilyn Monroe). Literally, thousands of sequins were sewn into place, by hand, à la Norell. The sterling level of craftsmanship really showed.</p></div>"
27,fall,2007,f2007,blumarine,"For a designer who loves her frills, the movement toward masculine tailoring could've been a headache. But Anna Molinari took it in her stride, adding satin power suits to her (as usual) dress-heavy lineup; to keep it Blumarine, she simply outlined the lapels, pockets, and skirt slits with glistening bugle beads.</p><p>As ever, there was no shortage of embellishments. They ran the gamut from subtle jet beading and passementerie details on black cashmere coats to the rather-too-loud trompe l'oeil crystal necklaces decorating satin dresses.</p><p>Molinari keyed into both the season¿s must-have neutral, gray—a short-sleeved chinchilla jacket, cropped, belted, and worn with skinny pants, was a highlight—and the color trend. A pair of fitted day sheaths came in one of Milan¿s loveliest brocades, a lush, painterly floral in shades of red and pink on a dark base. An emerald-green duchesse-satin bomber with matching pencil skirt was strong, too. As for the evening bolero made from densely embroidered roses of amethyst silk that closed the show, it was a final flip of the nose at all the talk of seriousness. Molinari prefers to have fun with fashion, thank you very much.</p></div>"
28,fall,2007,f2007,bottega-veneta,"With careful, virtually noiseless steps, Tomas Maier has moved up on the outside of fashion to give renewed credibility to that overused and downgraded term, <em>luxury</em>. If genuine luxury resides in out-of-the-ordinary things crafted with an intimate understanding of a life attainable only by the few, then Bottega Veneta could well stand as its contemporary definition. Crucially, Maier's point of view values the personal over the trendily available. His central principle, that ""clothes are a means of expression, not an end in themselves,"" means he has in his sights a woman who likes to look like a woman—curvaceous, individualistic, and beautifully grown-up.</p><p>It was there from the start today in the quiet but impactful glamour that picked up on a vaguely forties silhouette via a built-out shoulder folded into a cap sleeve that drew attention to a narrow, sometimes corseted torso, which then flared outward to the skirt. It's a way of treating suits and coats with details that rise above retro—say, a sprouting of blanket fringing on a layered skirt or shoulder, a puffy pocket on a jacket, or a bloused curve caught in the small of the back of a coat.</p><p>The eveningwear was just as good, and, at points, charged with an elegant eroticism, worked through satin bra tops and then three stunning black columns topped with flesh-colored crepe chiffon (quadruple-layered to ensure modesty). Overall, the achievement was that Bottega's ultraluxe ready-to-wear is seeming less and less like a background foil for its founding leather goods. Even so, Maier is steadily moving the signature bags onward and upward. Among the new soft hobos and hard clutches, the classic soft woven tote is still there, but it now comes in tinted lizard. The company notes that prices reaching $75,000 do not deter collectors, and given Maier's insight into such customers—who will likely fall for a multistrapped python sandal and a pair of pavé-set diamond bobble earrings without a second thought—it seems the designer can hardly put a foot wrong.</p></div>"
29,fall,2007,f2007,brian-reyes,"Climbing back up after a low season can be a slow process. Brian Reyes stumbled in Fall 2006, but he regained some traction with his Spring collection, and more recently he scored a confidence-building red-carpet coup (that was his royal-blue dress on <em>Ugly Betty</em>'s America Ferrara at the Golden Globes). The Fall show offered further evidence that he's back on track. Save for a few minor problems, it worked.</p><p>Reyes sent out an army of dresses in a flurry of colors, patterns, and textures borrowed from traditional Himalayan garb—kaleidoscope prints, cloud prints, and animal prints in silver, violet, emerald, and more. What many of these looks had going for them was this season's structured volume. Padded cocoon coats looked as if they could hold their own on Everest. A lightly quilted mod silver minidress formed a neat little cylinder around the body.</p><p>Moving on to movie-star dresses, Reyes impressed with a silver wrapped-and-pleated number and a gold-sequined column trimmed in black chiffon. Shirting-stripe dresses, on the other hand, felt out of place among all the rich colors and patterns. Still, we'd wager that Reyes, in current form, will enjoy another big awards show moment soon.</p></div>"
30,fall,2007,f2007,bruce,"Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli are so low-key and their clothes so unobtrusively, anonymously cool, that you might not have noticed their disappearance from the New York fashion scene in 2004. But seeing their fall show made you realize that you had missed them. Not only for their killer pintucked and pieced black lace bodysuit and micro-pleated purple minidress, but also for their off-kilter furry knits (tanks, blazers, and coats came in what they dubbed ""gorilla wool"" in the program notes). If the show had a bit of an eccentric streak, it was intentional.</p><p>""We looked back at all of our collections and saw that we did a lot of valid stuff that we'd like to expand on,"" Noselli said. ""We ended so abruptly. This really is another beginning for us."" The trousers with pleats at the side seams were a weak link, but high-waisted jeans, which they fearlessly paired with matching denim shirts, leave little doubt that they can cut a mean pair of pants. As for frocks, they ranged from a subtle matte-jersey dress with an easy, drawstring waist to a wood-paneling-print smock to a black lace cocktail number with sexy ribbon lacing. When the duo came out for a quick bow, a cheer erupted, along with a happy chorus of ""I'm so glad they're back.""</p></div>"
31,fall,2007,f2007,bruno-pieters,"Tina Chow was the inspiration cited in Bruno Pieters' Fall collection. Remembered for her sleek, understated style and boyish haircut, the late fashion icon made an apt point of reference for the 29-year-old Belgian designer with the sharp, almost architectural sensibility. You could imagine Chow in his shiny tweed lantern-sleeve jacket with a square neck and a light, flippy skirt worn with flat over-the-knee boots. And she might well have donned a plain black bustier with a high-waisted, quasi-bubble skirt in gold lamé. The collection's strengths were to be found in coats and suits nearly military in their precision. Its weaknesses, in the plain-Jane knits and the reds and yellows that lacked both the sophistication and the wearability of the neutrals. Pieters used some of the €100,000 he won from the Swiss Textiles Award in November to put on his first formal show, and—consider it growing pains—there were echoes of his do-it-yourself previous presentations in the distracting and unflattering hair ornaments. But those details aside, there's no denying the enviable polish of his tailoring.</p></div>"
32,fall,2007,f2007,burberry-prorsum,"Christopher Bailey's ability to keep changing, and yet stay in lockstep with Burberry brand identity, could be set as an M.B.A. study in effective fashion design. For Fall, he simply glanced at the Burberry Prorsum logo—a medieval knight on a charger—and took it from there. ""It's the same Burberry girl. She's just rocking a bit more,"" he said, describing a tougher, sexier look he extrapolated from the look of armor, tunics, and jousting regalia. It was hardly Sir Galahad, though; rather a matter of a full metal-studded trench, a pair of quilted patent gauntlets, and some thigh-high patent boots.</p><p>That, at least, is what a Notting Hill girl might extract from this collection. Others—i.e., those belonging to the more upscale, sophisticated, and international extended Burberry clan Bailey has built—will doubtless gravitate toward a velvety shaved-mink coat, bearing a minimal vestige of a trench in the storm-flap in back, or a superluxe quilted python puffer. Bailey, of course, has an iron grip on making the Burberry trenchcoat current for the label's broad bandwidth of customers. This season, beige gabardine and checks gave way to zippy padded anoraks with big fold-over collars and, latterly, silver-armor embroidery and rich jacquard flower- and leaf-patterned coats. That is, something for everyone, without veering from the plot.</p><p>For those tuned to a high-fashion frequency, the collection also registered a hint of the body-conscious dressing (in this case, layered over knits) and the belted, short, full-skirted Alaïa-esque silhouette that is coming out of London. Burberry, after all, is based in the English capital, and Christopher Bailey is that city's most accomplished example of what can be done when young design is melded with commerce.</p></div>"
33,fall,2007,f2007,calvin-klein-collection,"Sometimes it takes a mistake to point you in the right direction. Francisco Costa¿s strong yet spare Fall show today made instant history of his much-maligned Spring collection.</p><p>First out was a funnel-neck coat in lead gray (the non-color of the season) with sloping shoulders and gently curving seams to the knee. From there, he moved on to an oversize cashmere waffle-knit pullover, a boxy wool-tweed poncho, and a tech-y piqué hoodie that looked lacquered in its stiffness. Some jackets came with notch collars that draped down the back to form a ridgelike V.</p><p>Whereas outerwear seemed to be about the negative spaces between clothes and bodies—a potentially pretentious concept that nonetheless produced results—dresses hugged every curve his models had. The trio of gowns that closed the show clung to their ankles. Easier for navigating a cocktail party was a strapless blue number with a molded bustier. Or a marble-print wool-felt sheath with face-framing collar that gave new meaning to the term ""portrait neckline.""</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""i0vcdm""></div></div><p>This was precise and assured minimalism, and sexy to boot.

34,fall,2007,f2007,carlos-miele,"""I never had so much fun doing a collection!"" said this Brazilian designer fervently. The reason? Love. ""To have your muse by your side is the best thing,"" he gushed backstage before his show. The object of his enthusiasm is his newish girlfriend, Alex Kramer, a pretty blonde social who has taken on a serious advisory role.</p><p>The most notable change in the Miele mien is that this time, glitzy embellishment was kept to a minimum. The genesis of the Fall collection was a tale of three cities: New York (the base for his business), São Paulo (his hometown), and Paris (where Miele is planning to open a boutique). The designer had been struck by the way Kramer dressed differently as they bounced between the three capitals. Hence, the City of Light was referenced in printed dresses that recalled classic Emanuel Ungaro. Belted jackets in perforated suede and leather were quintessential New York sportswear. And there was a brief nod to the Brazilian metropolis in a few animal-print evening dresses.</p><p>But this was far from a perfect collection. It fell occasionally into the mousetrap of cheesiness—see the hot-pink bomber and black silk skirt. And a number of pieces, in particular the pants, were overly fussy. Still, it was good to see a designer who has been criticized for being flashy and a bit overwrought rein himself in.</p></div>"
35,fall,2007,f2007,carmen-marc-valvo,"Carmen Marc Valvo is best known for his eveningwear, specifically pretty dresses that don't rock the boat. ""He just makes a great gown,"" said celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch before today's show. ""They work whether you're being scrutinized on the red carpet or at a little party in your hometown."" This season, Valvo cited as inspiration the clean lines of mid-century modern designers like Isamu Noguchi and Jean-Michel Frank. Sticking to a minimalist's palette of black, white, steely grays, and icy nudes, he made liberal use of all manner of pleating (pintucked, accordion, sunburst) throughout the collection.</p><p>Fashion has long batted its eyelashes at architecture and industrial design, but marrying the two successfully isn't an easy proposition. While a lovely bateau-neck dress in ivory crepe with inverted pleats squarely hit the mark, other pieces looked stiff and awkward, particularly the ones with those tricky sunburst pleats.</p><p>Valvo also does daywear, most of which stayed in line with the season's sixties thread, with a metallic-tweed swing coat being particularly notable. Of course, the designer's daytime pieces do tend to betray his real interests—they all seem to be designed with an eye toward leaving the office for the night's activities.</p></div>"
36,fall,2007,f2007,carolina-herrera,"Somber will never be this designer¿s style—or that of her Park Avenue clients. And yet, there was almost a brooding or even mysterious quality to Herrera's Fall collection. Side-by-side with chic little skirtsuits and covetable furs (among them a must-have three-quarter-sleeve tunic), she showed a cropped jacket in broadtail with a sly, standup collar, a muskrat trench with felted-wool trim and belt, and long, languorous skirts with graceful trains. With dark menswear plaids and jacquards juxtaposed against the artistic detailing that has lately become a Herrera signature, the effect was altogether different from her confectionary-sweet spring outing.</p><p>The designer upped the luxury ante for evening. There was a couturelike finish to the gathered tulle that overlaid a painted georgette column; a dress appliquéd all over with squares of graduated taffeta was an impressive technical feat. Such extraordinary attention to detail sometimes got the better of Herrera, though. Embroidered broadtail, micropleats (at a shirt collar and running down the front of a skirt), and crystal-studded tights could quickly become too much of a good thing. But there were moments of lovely simplicity, too. Take, for instance, a black maxi coat worn with an organza blouse and wide-leg pants. Amid all that visual stimuli, it almost got lost, but solo it¿s a guaranteed hit.</p></div>"
37,fall,2007,f2007,catherine-malandrino,"Malandrino's models walked with slick black caps of side-parted hair: a gamine 'do in homage to Zizi Jeanmaire, the French prima ballerina who lit up fifties Europe with her magical <em>Carmen</em>.</p><p>Like the Spring show, which had a (slightly questionable) zing of eighties flavor, this was undeniably a retro moment, mining the sixties of Zizi's heyday (funnel-collared coats and graphic tunics) as well as the twenties (straight flapper dresses trimmed with marabou). For the most part, though, Malandrino avoided the dusty vintage pitfall, the one exception being a purple A-line coat that looked like it came off the rack at Resurrection. Pretty draped-jersey pieces, the least nostalgic look, tipped a hat not only to Jeanmaire but also to Malandrino's own dance background.</p><p>Over the past year, the designer has moved away from crafty fare and toward a cleaner look. Perhaps to fill a tactile void, she allowed herself to play with volume everywhere you turned—in the ballooning sleeves of a knit blazer, chic blouson jackets, and an iffy bubble evening gown.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""jov6r""></div></div><p>In short, Malandrino packed into the collection everything that a modern-day Jeanmaire might tuck into her traveling trunks, from a sexy daytime suit to a kicky little beaded houndstooth shift for aperitifs <em>avec</em> her own modern-day Roland Petit.</p></div>"
38,fall,2007,f2007,celine,"Ivana Omazic found inspiration in Françoise Sagan's 1977 novel <em>The Unmade Bed</em>. ""I like a woman who's feminine, but not a doll. Someone who's seductive and beautiful, but a little wild,"" she said backstage. Sounds like a foreigner's idea of the archetypical Frenchwoman—and Omazic, who is Croatian, did focus on the classical elements of Gallic chic. There were narrow belted sheaths, smart wide-legged pants, and statement trenches (one in lipstick-red duchesse satin), all shown with leather newsboy caps with flaps that fastened below the chin in place of the more traditional silk scarf.</p><p>The collection was an improvement over Spring's, in which the simple was made unnecessarily elaborate. There was an appealing lack of fuss in such Fall offerings as a black cape-back jacket with an A-line skirt, and a cocktail dress of midnight-blue sequins. But a tiger-print ponyskin skirt and a fitted tiger-print silk dress looked rather too much like an outsider's impersonation of the fictive femme fatale. Now that she's proven she can do the basics, Omazic's next challenge will be to move beyond the useful, but predictable, Parisian stereotypes and create an identity that's uniquely Celine.</p></div>"
39,fall,2007,f2007,central-saint-martins,"Thanks to its fiery visionary, professor Louise Wilson, the Central Saint Martins M.A. degree course has set the gold standard for international fashion education. All the rising names of London fashion—Christopher Kane, Jonathan Saunders, Marios Schwab, Todd Lynn, Roksanda Ilincic—have passed through the white hell of professor Wilson's crits, while many others populate the design studios of Dior, Lanvin, Chanel, Prada, Marni, Gucci, Jil Sander, and more.</p><p>That's why, once a year, the graduation ceremony is packed with headhunters, newshunters, and top store buyers craning to see a show that has by now become more than just an indicator of local Brit ideas. The class of 007 is German, Polish, Swedish, Dutch, Japanese, Australian, Greek, Spanish, Korean, and Russian, as well as English—and this year, it was a pair of Russians who swept off the glittering trophies.</p><p>Tatiana Katinova's long, lean black-and-white tailoring had a high padded shoulder with a rounded compactness that was echoed in the hips—judging by this collection, she could slot into a job at Jil Sander tomorrow. She won the overall prize, while Georgy Baratashvili scooped an £8,000 check as his reward for redesigning Puma sneakers as gold-and-silver dance shoes (they'll be delivered, for men and women, to Puma stores in August).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""wil4th""></div></div><p>Meanwhile, the best of their classmates' collections added an index of which way the avant-garde is pushing things. Annalisa Dunn's total sweater dressing—all multistriped poncho dresses, hoodie-scarves, wraps, hats, and socks—added more energy to the excitement bubbling around knits. Kryzsztof Strozyna's oversize lacquered-wood geometric cuffs, giant knot-pins, and chains looked great on belted beige dresses with the big, rounded shoulders that are the London trend. Tessa Birch designed wide simple dress shapes with bold angular blocks in gray, black, and mustard yellow, and filled them in with patches of PVC and plastic paillettes.</p><p>Overall, no Christopher Kane burst to the forefront this year, but this cohort of Saint Martins talent still provided plenty of directional clues: in with padded shoulders, calf-length skirts, scarves, wraps, stripes, and strong color—and out with last year's volume, flounces, and eighties body dresses. That's the kind of pointer the industry comes to snaffle up here, even if not a single one of these graduates is ready to sell a stitch.</p></div>"
40,fall,2007,f2007,chaiken,"The spirit of Millicent Rogers haunted this all-American show like a dirndl-skirt-wearing, Navaho-art-collecting, globe-trotting ghost. Jeff Mahshie, who co-designs the line with Julie Chaiken, explained that they chose Rogers as their starting point because of her ""chic, nomadic lifestyle,"" as well as the vivid, ethnographic colors—pungent tomato-reds and yolk-yellows—she pioneered in the 1940s.</p><p>You could see that Millicent flair in the longer, slimmer cut of the skirts, the curvy glamour sheaths, and the fuller trousers. Front-row guests like Kelly Rowland and Juliana Margulies no doubt were most interested in the latter: Customers count on Chaiken for a well-cut pair of pants. This season, they can choose from a flannel sailor look, a full-cuffed option, or sporty cropped styles. Many of these were worn in a (typically Millicent) mannish manner, with cravats and hand-knit calvary jackets.</p><p>Less successful were the tuxedo looks and cummerbund-bound waists. There were also several anomalous sari pieces—apparently a reference to the cultural tourism undertaken by their style icon—and five ""Taos"" dresses in full-on sun-scorched primaries that were just a bit too much Millicent.</p></div>"
41,fall,2007,f2007,chalayan,"Whatever other trends are swirling in the fashion atmosphere this season, the most pertinent is the big one: It's the environment, stupid. It was unavoidable at Hussein Chalayan, where the show opened with a whirling storm roaring upward out of a central void in the podium. Then, on walked a girl in a dress that—through the magic of LED technology—lit up and played its own movie, a colorful pixelated grid inspired by a cityscape, as seen from space via Google Earth.</p><p>It is fashion's responsibility (if it's to remain at all relevant) to register events in the world at large, but—as Chalayan has learned—it doesn't make sense to allow intellectual acuity to militate against making wearable clothes. Or, for that matter, to let a dramatic show concept steal the thunder of an exceptionally designed collection. This season, the designer had all the angles fully covered: There were coats, there were dresses, and there was the undercurrent of a mind thinking about the seasons, and their effect on how we might dress.</p><p>One of Chalayan's starting points was the protective structure of Japanese samurai armor, manifested in the red-and-black stripes and the articulated panels in the opening sequence of coats. Those soon gave way to blue-and-white striped T-shirt dresses with body braces and tabards fastened over them, and then a whole line of thought-about headgear. Peaked caps were built into hoods, and then came the helmet devices, integrally wired to perform in response to the weather. One unfolded itself to enclose the head, and a Plexiglas fishbowl and flying saucer lit up inside to shine mood-enhancing light on their wearers during the dark days of winter.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""we7mh""></div></div><p>There was something about this that was tender and inventive rather than stridently eco-activist. Along the way, Chalayan also showed things like rose jacquard dresses that, out of context of the show, are simply modern and pretty. In practical terms, the result is that Chalayan is on his way to selling more clothes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't also thank him for staging the most thoughtful fashion exploration of the season.</p></div>"
42,fall,2007,f2007,chanel,"There were an ice rink, banks of snow, and, up above, a suspended skyscape of tulle clouds, gently puffing vapor into the atmosphere under the glass dome of the Grand Palais. Welcome to Chanel, where Karl Lagerfeld picked up on the idea of cold-weather college-girl styling that's emerging as a Parisian subtheme. How can ""random"" and casual work for one of the great establishment names of the City of Light? Lagerfeld approached it by turning the house bouclé tweeds into colorful checks, punching them up with magenta and turquoise, and adding a load of bobbly crochet, striped sock hats, sequined rugby vests, stacks of plastic geometric cuffs, and shiny breastplate necklaces.</p><p>Since Coco Chanel co-opted Tyrolean felted jackets as one of the inspirations for her classic genre, there was a vague link between the past and Lagerfeld's references to, say, snowboarding and skiwear—like the puffer-sleeved tweed with a cowl hoodie and narrow fur skirt, shaved to look like corduroy. A sense of all this is going on in fashion at large, and it wasn't a bad device for loosening things up at a time when ""ladylike"" is feeling distinctly over. Still, though Lagerfeld proved yet again that he is a canny barometer of every change in the fashion atmosphere, he's eternally careful not to lose sight of the fact that Chanel is for a woman who essentially wants to feel put-together and dainty. Example: She might now want to wear one of Chanel's standard creamy blouses untucked, with a rugby-striped sequin vest over a pair of skinny pants, or make an impeccable black shift look futuristic with a flash of beige patent in the neckline. By evening, in any case, Lagerfeld had cleared the way for a plain view of little black dresses, now with draped shoulder lines, bows, and flyaway trails that looked light and lovely in movement. For the faithful, that was just enough youthfulness to keep the appeal of Chanel feeling perfectly current, even if, as a whole, this didn't quite come up to the level of one of Lagerfeld's blockbusters.</p></div>"
43,fall,2007,f2007,chloe,"Paulo Melim Andersson has big shoes—those great, chunky Chloé wedges girls have loved for years—to fill. And he's imagined a new girl to put in them: ""She's angry, but funny-angry,"" he said before the show, ""A girl who steals from her mother. I want this to be young-young, with no tricks. Clean, but not minimal.""</p><p>So she came over as bit of a handful, this one: a stomping little character with a taste for asymmetric black, orange, and nylon-look trash-bag fabric, rather than broderie anglaise first-communion dresses and peasant smocks. Her boots are based on Doc Martens and ""Diane Arbus"" galoshes, and she has a giant textured green messenger bag slung across her back like a guitar case. She likes print, texture, and off-colors too—and Melim Andersson has a lot of them, with a glossary of nutty names to match: ""Secret Garden"" trees, ""Murder Scene"" streaks, ""Magpie"" jeweled embroidery, and ""Mushy Pea"" green.</p><p>Enough time has elapsed after the departure of Phoebe Philo for Chloé's pretty, vintage-y flyaway aesthetic to be in need of an update. After a long search, Melim Andersson (a British-educated Scandinavian designer whose first job was at Margiela) was hired from that other left-field girlie brand, Marni, and at this first outing something in the Marimekko-type print and square-cut, off-kilter shapes carried the traces of his former employment.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>The show had energy, but it's too early to judge how any newcomer will make his mark based on one collection (it took quite a few seasons for Philo to climb to the ranks of cult leader, after all). For now, the pertinent question is whether Melim Andersson gets the fact that Chloé has to be an easily broken down assemblage of fab pieces that fly out of shops. Reactions were split over that. This season label loyalists will zoom in on familiar items like the loose, orange semi-sheer dress with a drop waist and ruffled flutter in the skirt, the shifts and skirts decorated with plastic paillettes and crystal, and a few (maybe too few, since it's winter) re-cut boyfriend coat-jackets to throw on over them. What's new is that this Fall there are also lures for an edgier, tougher customer, like the slithery nylon-look bustier sheath with an unzippable collar, and a cool asymmetric sleeveless shift with volume caught into the lower back. Is that moving Chloé out of its comfort zone, or moving it on? It's too soon to make a call on that, but it will be intriguing to watch how the real votes are counted—not on the runway, but in the stores.</p></div>"
44,fall,2007,f2007,chris-benz,"In an art-filled gallery at Christie¿s, we met a gaggle of insouciant bookworm types with a quirky dress code and a killer sense of color: Chris Benz, at the dewy age of 24, cast his first-ever show as a trio of set pieces starring girls who threw together looks in a mash-up of styles. Jodhpurs were worn with pajama tops under roomy, lightweight tweed jackets; a calf-hair jacket topped rugby stripes; wool shorts mixed with a micropleat chiffon tank and a delicately embroidered tulle cardigan.</p><p>Pea coats, trenches, and boxy jackets came not double- but quadruple-breasted. Some of Benz¿s color combinations (dusty blue with mustard and navy, acid-bright turquoise with navy and rust) could easily have gone terribly wrong. But instead they struck all the right chords. This was definitely a strong breakout from the starting gate.</p></div>"
45,fall,2007,f2007,christian-dior,"If you're getting into the forties this season (and that's definitely one way to go), John Galliano is the man to fulfill those latent Joan Crawford urges, no holds barred. His ready-to-wear collection for Christian Dior was virtually a camp-fabulous Hollywood spectacular—like a pumped-up 2007 remake of <em>The Women</em> (Cukor, 1939; ever a fashion favorite), but this time played out in full glorious purple, pistachio, electric blue, and fuchsia, rather than black and white.</p><p>As a comeback from last season's comparatively muted collection, this was Galliano performing at full throttle, filling the runway with 58 girls dressed, as grandma would say, to the nines. Partly, it was an homage to Dior—the dove-gray runway, the banked flowers, and the balustraded staircase—and partly it was, as the French rather awkwardly translate it, a collection ""declined"" from Galliano's triumphant Madame Butterfly haute couture collection for Spring. To ""decline,"" in fashion-Franglais, means to take the wildly expensive handcrafted fantasies of couture and turn them into factory-produced lookie-likeys. Sometimes ""declension"" (here and elsewhere) can actually lead to decline—i.e., disappointing commercial husks of the original thought. But now, in a flurry of energy and application, Galliano has upped the ante for Dior, reproducing believably close simulacra of such details as the origami-folding (see the suit pockets) and shortened versions of the multitiered ruffled skirts seen in his couture.</p><p>There was showiness and chic in this. The python jackets and ostrich swing coats with sleeves built out in fox were the declarative side, but a sensuous womanliness came through, too. Galliano's draping, ingeniously wrapped to the hip in a purple skirtsuit and a chartreuse day dress, or deployed as one-shouldered asymmetries and sashes for cocktail and evening, created husband-hunting outfits of a type guaranteed to net results, be it 1947 or 2007.</p></div>"
46,fall,2007,f2007,christian-lacroix,"It wasn't a promising start, because who wants to arrive at Christian Lacroix to be greeted by black coats? Ignore that, though. In the second half, this show picked up wonderfully. Once Lacroix let himself loose on evening, a vision of the color, prints, bows, and general idiosyncratic whimsy he puts into his couture was suddenly and—for the first time—prettily captured in his ready-to-wear collection.</p><p>In a season when the eye craves color, what Lacroix can do with poufy little dresses splashed with painterly strokes of orange, purple, and pink was a treat, as were his purple and emerald velvets and a delightful scarlet satin ruffled bustier. Lacroix's fantasias in haute couture have an extravagance whose applicability to real life is sometimes hard to imagine. Here, though, he made it believable by abbreviating the lengths and putting everything with black opaques and a pair of outrageously original boots, which in themselves were riveting. Part biker, part Western, yet wholly feminine, they were decorated with a flower pattern of domed studs running across the pointy toe and around the slouched-down back of the heel, and they were then finished—as Lacroix always finishes his best things—with a bow in front. At the end, the most wantable pair came in dark-green metallic leather, smothered in pearls. For that alone, this collection gets a three-star rating and a recommendation that any cool and special girl check it out immediately.</p></div>"
47,fall,2007,f2007,christopher-kane,"Scarlett O¿Hara; Rambo; Elvira, Mistress of the Dark—and a giant set of Swarovski-crystal bathroom knobs. These were just some of the rich and potent components that went into Christopher Kane¿s second collection. But they don¿t begin to describe what came out: circle-skirted dresses decorated with corrugated ¿ammo¿ bands, gorgeous velvets spliced together with tough leather, huge crystal studs in place of buttons, wicked-witchy calf-length stretch dresses, and heavy-duty chrome-ringed belts.</p><p>¿It¿s Paul Delaroche¿s <em>The Execution of Lady Jane Grey</em>—and vindictive, man-eating women!¿ Kane rasped backstage, half-dead with exhaustion. It was a triumph, both for the designer and his sister Tammy, who is the chief muse, in-house model, and general egger-on in this remarkable sibling enterprise.</p><p>Kane managed to confound skeptics who wondered whether he¿d be able to move on from the ultrayoung, ruffly neon-and-nylon-lace collection with which he made his mark last summer. He did, with a giant step into tough black and oxblood leather, sumptuous burnt orange, scarlet, and emerald velvet (tear down the drapes!) and an intensely creative sequence of work that patched fluid Versace-esque crystal mesh over a base of matte-black knit.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""jx6674""></div></div><p>Some caviled that at first sight it was reminiscent of Azzedine Alaïa, and (in the Elvira moment) the drapey stretch silhouettes of Romeo Gigli. But neither Alaïa nor Gigli used fabrics or combined colors this way. Kane¿s energy derives not from looking at fashion history but from the sheer enjoyment of working in a nonstop creative fury with his sister in their rented house in Dalston. The level of polish and accomplishment in this collection was precocious; you could put the show on a runway in Paris, and it would still shine. Kane¿s the strongest talent to have emerged in London in a decade—and more remarkably, his clothes are selling. Twenty-two dresses flew out of the London store Browns within two days of delivery, confounding the chorus of critics who called his first collection vulgar. Just one year out of Central Saint Martins, this young designer is an extraordinary star on the rise.</p></div>"
48,fall,2007,f2007,collette-dinnigan,"After taking several seasons off the runways to raise a baby, this Australian designer set out to prove that she¿s capable of more than the beaded, lacy confections that¿ve made her a red carpet favorite. ¿You¿ll see a lot more daywear,¿ she said backstage. ¿And a new edginess, too.¿</p><p>It turns out that Collette Dinnigan is no slouch in the tailoring department. She showed this season¿s high-waisted, deep-cuffed trousers with a Peter Pan-collared chiffon shirt and a leather cummerbund. Other pants came hip-slung and tapered, with a slight crop. She also keyed into the trend toward special sleeves: batwings on jackets and teardrops on a brocade coat.</p><p>The trouble is, there weren¿t enough of these strong, sharp pieces in a mix that came off feeling a bit light on the day when Paris¿ big kids came out to play. The few cocktail dresses that she did show—a trapeze in a bejeweled floral lamé or an hourglass in gold lace—were unfortunately almost obscured by large knit scarves twisting elaborately around the models¿ necks.

49,fall,2007,f2007,comme-des-garcons,"“I’m tired of mundane, everyday fashion,” declared Rei Kawakubo. “I’m curious. I want something that takes us to another world.” She didn’t mean another world as in futuristic sci-fi, but rather something that seemed to start with an exploration of the tender parts of the developing female psyche—which these days are usually stamped out before a girl is 10 years old. That, at least, was one reading of the Minnie Mouse hats and the tiny baby frocks sewn to the front of the violet and pink dresses that opened the show. They were sweet and playfully imaginative without being saccharine, and led to more tropes of childlike ingenuity: padded, appliquéd bows and flowers implanted on stretch dresses and, later, like an adolescent’s dream of a virtual boyfriend, a pair of 3-D hands grasping the hips of a skirt.</p><p>Still, Comme des Garçons is the Rorschach test of fashion, so that may be just so much subjective speculation. In any case, just when you think you’ve spotted a reference, Kawakubo reliably skews away from it. So it was with the rest of the show, in which she patched zones of synthetics onto velvet or menswear jackets and overlaid shine on matte—nothing very girlish about that. Nevertheless, those elements—natural/unnatural texture contrasts and Kawakubo’s fresh and lovely combinations of red, pink, and mauve—succeeded in landing this resolute outsider’s collection within the general conversations fashion is having with itself this Fall.</p></div>"
50,fall,2007,f2007,costello-tagliapietra,"The boys from Brooklyn are playing in the big leagues.</p><p>Showing for the first time in the Bryant Park tents, Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra did ingenious variations on their favorite medium, jersey. Everything was a bit <em>off</em>, but in a good way. How did they do it? By, in their words, ¿controlling the pleating and cowling in one area.¿ And so a dress had a ¿cowl¿ drape over just one hip, and skirts were likewise skewed asymmetrically. (They even somehow managed to do a collar that appeared upside-down, i.e., pointing up, without it looking weird.) Mixed in among the more sober dresses in gray, brick, and ink were a few slinkier numbers, like a long black two-piece for the Halstonette of 2007.</p><p>The duo also did pants, skirts, and jackets (one that belled out boldly over the hips) in luxe tapestry material and other French weaves. A red one¿shouldered dress with a streamer ¿tie¿ wrapped around the neck and the bodice was especially smart. Less successful were the experiments with crystal embellishment.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4zhtsu""></div></div><p>By the end of the show, the boys had proved they can pitch a few curveballs, and that they deserve their spot in the rotation.</p></div>"
51,fall,2007,f2007,costume-national,"¿I wanted to mix two different worlds, uniforms and dresses,¿ said Ennio Capasa backstage before his show. As a point of departure, this concept sticks pretty close to Costume National¿s successful formula: strong tailoring that doesn¿t ignore sex appeal. The opening coat, a side-closure number with an asymmetrical lapel and utilitarian-looking belt slung low across the hips, established a military theme that was echoed by camo-green pieces in fine wool and alpaca, along with fur Cossack hats and mufflers.</p><p>The suits were an exercise in sharp simplicity. One in banker gray and another in black satin were cut broad and boxy through the jacket but pencil-thin through the pants. Many of the evening looks, on the other hand, were overdone. The colorful duchesse satins on the narrow, knee-length dresses might have been pinched from Prada—in this, Capasa wasn¿t alone—and their strappy necklines were fussy. Capasa is capable of doing both structure and sensuality (witness the navy cape dress, complexly draped yet effortless), but this season only the tailored side of the equation added up.</p></div>"
52,fall,2007,f2007,cynthia-rowley,"The usual oddball celebrity mix turned up at Cynthia Rowley: Alan Cumming, Molly Shannon, Russell Simmons, and Tatum O'Neal. But those weren¿t the only stars under the sky-high ceilings at Gotham Hall. Cynthia Rowley was looking heavenward, to the aurora borealis.</p><p>Starshine and shimmer were ubiquitous, as they were throughout the New York shows. Metallic brocades, glistening sequins, liquid lamé—all were cut into the sixties minidresses and skirts that came to completely dominate the show. (It would have benefited from a good edit.) The few variations in silhouette were the best looks, including slim trousers topped with floaty blouson tops and seventies brimmed hats, and a chic burgundy calf-hair car coat. The quilted satin pieces, on the other hand, fell rather flat.</p><p>But while Rowley may not be big on construction details or luxury fabrics, one thing can be said of her: She always has her tongue in her cheek. The witty thematic visual cues included a trompe l'oeil flame print, and long braids referencing comet tails, with the models in the final turn clinging to a Rapunzel-length plait worn by the lead girl.</p></div>"
53,fall,2007,f2007,d-g,"With a blast of <em>Disco Inferno</em> and a long stretch of animal-printed runway, Dolce e Gabbana set off in the direction of the Studio 54 seventies. It began with a series of chiffon leopard-spot dresses with full sleeves and high, scarf-tied necklines, intercut with variations on bow-tied, white-shirted tuxedo suits. This is established territory for their main line, and it lent a distinctly dressed-up focus to one of their familiar romps around the junior brand—happily, the effect was more a case of Jerry Hall posing on a banquette than momma coming home to break up a teenage house party.</p><p>Not that there weren't short shorts and minute gold Lurex numbers and incy baby dolls à la Biba to keep the little ones happy—or bicolored patent duffels so oversized a girl could probably smuggle a boyfriend upstairs in one. But overall, the sense of extending the brand was uppermost. Cute staples, like high-belted black coats and nonconfrontational flower-print dresses, strengthened the Mom-can-I-have-that appeal for Fall. And who knows? Maybe the high-waist metallic flares and some of the more covered-up gowns might tempt the woman who holds the purse strings to shell out for herself on a mother-daughter shopping spree.</p></div>"
54,fall,2007,f2007,daks-by-giles-deacon,"Giles Deacon has pitched up in Milan to show his first collection under contract to Daks, a British brand known from the thirties onward as a solid producer of respectable clothing for English gents and their good lady wives. Before his show, he talked about his ambition to address businesswomen, and since that's a species routinely blanked by fashion designers, his words—and the fact that he is lauded on his own turf as British Designer of the Year—sounded promising.</p><p>Given the heritage of the brand, the obvious way to set about creating updated business attire is to work on tailoring, or at least daywear necessities for high achievers. Deacon started out by doing just that, and he came up with a precise, wasp-waisted silhouette with a rounded hip, achieved through boning and a tie-on pad device that goes beneath the coat and jacket. That molded shape—vaguely retro in a New Look-ish way—chimed with both the forties trend and the menswear feeling of the season.</p><p>There were well-executed dresses, too, pieced in matte-shine velvet, wool, and duchesse satin, but the show swiftly drifted off into fashion-y ""statements"" more fit for extreme magazine shoots than any recognizable business agenda. This involved transplanting some of the vast cable-knit pieces and geometric satin patchworks seen in Deacon's own collection, and a big quilted stole device whose practicality beyond the runway is questionable. In other words, it hardly amounted to a riposte to Jil Sander. Perhaps that's because Deacon, frantically working away with his cool gang in east London, doesn't run across many corporate highfliers, or even medium-affluent women with a day job outside fashion. It's not particularly fair to bawl him out for that, because he's only part of a syndrome. Watching shows these days, it's increasingly hard to stifle the thought that the best thing many designers could do is beg to be seconded to an employed woman for a week.</p></div>"
55,fall,2007,f2007,daryl-k,"Rock chic is what Daryl Kerrigan does so well, and this time she did it with an eye to the seventies. ""I began with Jane Fonda in <em>Klute</em>, for a leaner silhouette,"" she said, referencing Bree Daniels, circa 1971, perhaps the most famous call girl in all moviedom. Two fantastic, long and lean and shiny trenches opened the show. ""We call it liquid leather, but it's actually a high-tech Japanese fabric,"" the designer explained. ""Anyway, it's the ultimate mac.""</p><p>Colder days will warrant the navy wool version that followed. And from there, Kerrigan moved on to tunics and dresses with dolman sleeves, swingy coats, slouchy blouson jackets and tops, and cozy belted cardigans. Nearly everything was paired with leggings, which came in satin, molten lamé, or, best of all, stretch leather. The closing series of washed-wool plaid pieces added a rustic touch to this otherwise slick urban collection. Yes, it's a formula, but when it works this well, why change?</p></div>"
56,fall,2007,f2007,dennis-basso,"Dennis Basso's presentation today was a thoroughly social affair, complete with the designer's ""ladies,"" cocooned in their furs, clapping at their favorite looks. Basso stated that he was launching his first full ready-to-wear collection this season ""because people wanted this,"" and he offered if not exactly a full line, a few hand-embroidered herringbone pants and micro-minidresses. The main draws, notwithstanding, were the designer's cleverly worked furs, like a sable coat in a chevron pattern, or a hand-embroidered shearling with a generous trim of cognac chinchilla that gently bobbed in step with the model.</p><p>Fall's line included many sueded minks, some featuring crafty scallops of fur, and almost all worn with embroidered leather belts. Russian broadtail jackets featured intricate embroideries. Still, you had to wonder, where were the full-on and full-length furs that keep Basso's loyal following warm and happy? Presumably, they're waiting back at the showroom for the likes Patti LaBelle, who arrived at today's presentation in a coat so plush it even managed to snag its own front-row seat.</p></div>"
57,fall,2007,f2007,derek-lam,"So long, Claire McCardell. The American sportswear pioneer who was the inspiration behind Derek Lam's fine Spring collection has been replaced by something altogether sexier—a change of direction that seemed to interfere with the designer's better instincts. The first clue was a pair of black leather-and-suede riding pants—leggings, really—that trotted down the runway with a boxy, asymmetrical boiled-felt coat. Other exhibits included a bustier dress, a clingy bolero worn with a flippy tweed skirt, and an otherwise office-ready gray flannel sheath with corsetry seaming on the bodice. The clothes' exaggerated shoulders, high nipped waists, and abbreviated hemlines looked like a wink and nod in the direction of Azzedine Alaïa and Hervé Léger. The trouble being, these designers were big news last season, which made Lam's show, for all its sexy wearability, look derivative.</p><p>But if there were shades of other collections in his day looks, evening was pure Derek. The goddess gowns he did for Spring were reinterpreted as flirty cocktail numbers, one in gold silk lamé. And the trio of graceful double-crepe columns in black, royal, and white that closed the show were, simply put, drop-dead gorgeous.</p></div>"
58,fall,2007,f2007,derercuny,"It¿s not often that a new label emerges on the Milan runways, so it was with some enthusiasm that a small audience assembled for designer Mina Lee¿s debut Derercuny show. Until now, the small collection of prettily embellished clothes that glance at the trends rather than follow them blindly had been seen by appointment only. Chalk it up to first-timer jitters and inexperience, but some of the pieces (a gold jacquard matelassé skirt worn with a lamé blouse, and the bubble shapes) hinted perhaps too much at Prada and Marni. More discouraging, a pair of long tiered dresses in woven cashmere with an overly stiff drape just didn¿t do enough to flatter the models.</p><p>Those issues aside, there were enough good things here to bring the crowd back again next time—from the sculptural black coats, including the requisite cape, to the elegant cocktail dresses with hand-constructed bows at the bust. The young company can be thankful, too, that it has been backed by Samsung. Judging by the A-list models booked, the expensive-looking fabrications, and the over-the-knee flat boots, Derercuny has pockets deep enough to give its talent time to work out the kinks.</p></div>"
59,fall,2007,f2007,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg's Fall show was her first as the newly appointed president of the CFDA. As she begins her tenure, the industry is confronting some challenging issues, from the long-term project of relocating the tents to the very of-the-moment ""thin model"" debate. But one look at her impressive front row—which was lined not with starlets but with newsmen and media moguls, including Anderson Cooper, Charlie Rose, <em>Vanity Fair</em>'s Graydon Carter, and, of course, her husband, Barry Diller—and it's obvious that this is a woman who means business.</p><p>As for her collection, it was singular in its focus on dresses. It opened with a signature wrap, done up in ruffled black taffeta that hinted at the Spanish influences cited in her program notes. From there, it was all leg, whether the model on the runway was wearing a Miró color-block shift, a velvet flapper style with fringe, or a strapless lace jersey number with a gathered hem. Many of the dresses came with matching coats, a nod toward the designer's sense of practicality—an asset that should serve her industry well in the coming months.</p></div>"
60,fall,2007,f2007,dkny,"It¿s a given that no matter which way the trend winds blow, DKNY will offer up a paean to the city that is such an innate part of its DNA. This season, Donna Karan set the stage with shifting projections of New York¿s twinkling skyline and a two-story neon sign that transported a bit of Times Square down to Greenwich Street. The standing-room-only setup, with the runway striped down the center like a street, had editors jockeying for prime viewing spots like a crowd gathered to watch the Macy¿s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p><p>Appearances were deceiving, though, because when the first look appeared—a salt-and-pepper tweed jacket over a printed-chiffon bow blouse topped with a beret—it was another fashion capital that popped into mind: the City of Light. The whole show had a Gallic inflection, with, for example, a wide-legged suit and heart-print blouse that tipped its hat to Yves Saint Laurent; or the charming, flippy little skirts with matching jackets in tweeds and jacquards (a wonderfully fresh way for a twentysomething to sport a suit). Though there was a hint of mean streets in a black shearling jacket and cargo pants, this was mostly a sweet affair. There were a few low points—like the baffling overly bright satin-and-jersey ""scuba"" dresses that closed the show—but overall, it was highly successful. As for the Paris-on-the-Hudson mood of ¿Le DKNY,¿ it was yet another affirmation that New York style is indeed international.</p></div>"
61,fall,2007,f2007,dolce-gabbana,"Welcome to the Dolce e Gabbana dungeon. It¿s a black padded cell in which a posse of amazons stands frozen in classic lesbian S&amp;M poses, silver spanking crops at the ready. This is the tableau that turned on a dais at the end of the runway in the Metropol theater, the venue in which the designers installed themselves last year. Trust the transgressive ebullience of Dolce &amp; Gabbana to bring up sex and in-your-face glamour. Forget the fact that most everyone else has their heads down concentrating on modesty and sobriety—these two have never had any truck with that. And neither, frankly, has the massive customer base they¿ve built: Their billion-dollar turnover says so.</p><p>The show was one major performance, with wave after wave of metallic bustier dresses, hard-corseted belts, metal eye masks, latex-look dresses, see-through lace, studded coats—a veritable catalog of the kind of porn-chic material pioneered by Madonna in her <em>Sex</em> book of the early nineties (and it was she, indeed, who was panting <em>Erotic</em> on the sound track). The vice device didn¿t totally obscure the fact that this collection did have a day base untouched by kink. There was a great, mannish-shouldered pantsuit and luscious coats—including a puffy satin parka—in there, and an excellent pair of the season¿s high-waisted seventies pants that were testament to Domenico Dolce¿s inimitable cutting skills.</p><p>After a while, of course, the theme took over, especially during the long buildup to the finale of no less than 13 crystal-mesh gowns, some of them giving a clear view to the underwear. This has become a seasonal ritual by now. It has undoubtedly established Dolce &amp; Gabbana as the biggest, flashiest show on the Milan calendar, and its publicity will penetrate parts of the media that could care less about fashion. You have to hand it to them for that. But there¿s something about designing to fill the podium of this new theater-auditorium that can be distancing to the fashion-sensitive. Some are beginning to pine for the intimacy of the days when Dolce &amp; Gabbana would pitch a tent outside their home, invite people in, settle them down with a snack and a drink, and let them enjoy watching Gisele et al. cavorting at eye level, while inspecting every stitch of what they do so well. If they could recapture some of that, everyone would be happy.</p></div>"
62,fall,2007,f2007,donna-karan,"Donna Karan came home to New York for Fall. The walls of her Greenwich Street space displayed past advertising campaigns that used the city as a backdrop. On the runway below, everything looked so right (save for the costume-y feather chapeaux) that you had to wonder why the designer ever looks elsewhere for inspiration. Revisiting one of her earliest signatures, Karan built this collection around bodysuits. In a season of such minimalist layers, they fit right in, turning bustier jersey dresses into legitimate daytime looks, and introducing a welcome dose of ease to hourglass silhouettes in silk satin. The interplay of matte and shine (stretch satin belts cinching wool double knits) and bright shots of chartreuse, teal, and violet against black were other timely motifs, but what the designer explored in greatest detail, what she seemed most charged about, was draping.</p><p>For evening, swirls of jewel-tone silk charmeuse curled from one shoulder around the body to the hem, sometimes with fans of taffeta decorating the bust. Jackets in organza mohair tweed and silk radzimir were softened with gently molded lapels that blossomed open to reveal bare necklines. These were paired with the season's slightly rounded and elongated skirts. Pants played a very minor role, which is too bad, because the trousers that Karan showed with belted tunics could fill the gaping void for such chic practicalities that exists on the New York runways.</p></div>"
63,fall,2007,f2007,doo-ri,"Doo-Ri Chung had a very good year. She nabbed the Swarovski Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent in June and then in November took home the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund's big prize. What Chung has going for her is a distinct personal vision, and for Fall she continued to sharpen her focus. That isn't to say the collection was free from slip-ups. The crystal cages and harnesses worn over her signature jersey dresses got a little complicated, and it would've been nice to see her work in colors other than bordeaux, emerald, and navy.</p><p>But if today's show wasn't on a level with her accomplished Spring outing, there was still a lot to like. The silhouette was short and fresh, and her draping was at its most imaginative in a number of swingy cocktail numbers, the hems of which looped over to swag decoratively from the side seams or the bust. Ironically for a designer known for her dresses, it was the tight, rib-clinching pants and cropped three-quarter-sleeve jackets shown with elbow gloves that were the strongest looks. Chung should consider adding more sexy tailoring to her dress parade the next time around.</p></div>"
64,fall,2007,f2007,douglas-hannant,"With his girls Debbie Bancroft, Valesca Guerrand-Hermès, and Lorraine Bracco perched in the front row, Douglas Hannant sent out a tenth-anniversary collection full of expensive-looking little skirt suits and endlessly bejeweled evening confections that appeal to women of a certain zip code—and upon which he's built his label. Taking the Renaissance as an inspiration, the designer inserted corsetry laces in the side seams of a fitted velvet jacket and at the back of a strapless gown. Cocktail dresses in metallic tweed came with puffed poet's sleeves or a tucked ruffle at the hem. And tiny silk Fortuny pleats cascaded from a ruff accented with a contrasting velvet bow.</p><p>Backstage, the designer explained that the theme stopped at the silhouette, which was lean and modern. ""It's time to be sexy again,"" he said. And so, for good measure, he tossed in a couple of flirty flapper dresses—one in tiers of gold chain fringe, another in black ostrich feathers—and a sequin tunic that in its brevity channeled Edie Sedgwick more than the Mona Lisa. These last had a freshness that, a decade in, suggest Hannant sees the value in wooing a younger social set.</p></div>"
65,fall,2007,f2007,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten has an almost tribal following of faithful customers who unconditionally love and buy what he designs, season in, season out. Last time around, that band was joined by a hardcore cohort of fashion enthusiasts who spotted something brilliantly right-on in his clean, sporty, brightly colored Spring collection. Sadly, that enthusiasm ebbed away for Fall amid a disappointing welter of dreary colors and awkward shapes.</p><p>Something of the sporty theme was still there, though, in adaptations of classic, quilted-nylon country jackets, which, granted, nodded to the puffer-ish theme that¿s been generally cropping up in the collections. Van Noten¿s other idea, true to his taste for multiethnic references, was Indian paisley, which came abstracted into black-and-white print or picked out in sequined embroideries. Neither of those devices was enough to lift things anywhere near the level of last season¿s blockbuster, however. Partly it was due to the relentless parade of gray, mustard, khaki, and dulled orange, though equal blame must be attributed to the baggy dropped-crotch divided skirts, and the ugly orthopedic shoes with ankle-thickening socks. Once sifted by expert buyers, there will likely be nothing much here to turn off the women who rely on Van Noten. But in this show, the characteristic alternative joyousness of his perspective sank from view.</p></div>"
66,fall,2007,f2007,dsquared,"If such a process as the homoeroticization of women really exists, Dean and Dan Caten put on a big show of it at Dsquared. What we saw was a standard male-on-male erotic fantasy (construction worker) projected onto a women¿s fashion collection. The foreplay was an acrobatic performance from a couple of bare-chested ¿workmen¿ who swung from ropes amid a mise-en-scène building site leading to a rough concrete runway.</p><p>Fair enough, as entertainment anyway. At this stage in the game a rough-trade burlesque is hardly offensive, but the prologue did provide a moment to ponder how exactly this is supposed to work as an enticement for women. If men who fancy men put the clothes they fancy men in on girls—what¿s in it for the girls? As it turned out, it was the models¿ chance to swing a truncheon, don a harness, and, for a lucky couple, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to walk out in front of a couple of hundred people sporting black patent horse blinders (did they draw lots for that one backstage?).</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>Still, it would be making too much of it to say that anyone was particularly outraged—or that that the theme even interfered much with the view of the Catens¿ range of clothing. The designers are good at selling fashioned-up jeanswear, and the construction-crew theme did give an excuse for showing their baggy, zippy cargo pants and biker jackets sexed up with deconstructed corsetry, their signature cropped jeans and a strong series of trend-hitting puffers in black, violet, cobalt, and hazard-yellow.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""keen9""></div></div><p>Somehow, by the end, the fantasy slewed off into a vaguely medieval heavy-metal zone. A black goat-hair coat had hunched shoulders so high they resembled wings, a tunic was armored with plastic shoulder plates, and a chain-mail tank dress (which might have started life as a security-fence idea) got shown over rockin¿ leather pants. Delivered to stores, Dsquared always looks well made and has a distinct character that has a following. Do customers need to appreciate how those clothes were spoofed-up on the runway to understand them? Of course not: The product speaks for itself. But sometimes you can¿t help wondering exactly what sort of club life goes on behind the gray façades of Milan to keep its resident designers thus inspired.</p></div>"
67,fall,2007,f2007,duro-olowu,"Duro Olowu's show has finally brought the talent that's been cooking away in his Portobello Road store, OG2, into full sight. A Nigerian with a sophisticated eye for mixing splashily printed vintage couture fabrics with seventies-style tailoring and hoards of exceptional jewelry, he has steadily built a business—and many friends—around the first signature wide-sleeved, high-waisted patchwork dress he designed two years ago. Today's violet and bright-green African-print velvet coats instantly captured the essence of his appeal in their exuberantly luxurious swing.</p><p>""I wanted it to have practical volume,"" he said, ""a regal normality. I called it 'Bamako Pompadour.'"" Bamako is the capital of Mali, which, he explained, ""had an empire of huge wealth and intellect—and beautiful women.""</p><p>If it was smart to lay a foundation for a couple of years before deciding to show, the move also raised the bar for Olowu, setting him the task of proving he can do more than just that one dress. He pulled that off by orchestrating a total look, from leather headband visors to necklaces made from recycled belt buckles and beads to shiny patent shoes and boots—all sourced from craftspeople he found around London. His new squared-off <em>agbada</em> dress, in fluid brown, black, and gray color-blocked jersey, had an easy, drapey elegance that looked fresh. And though a too long section of gamekeeper tailoring in the middle broke the spell a bit, that was only a minor beginner's demerit in a collection that brought a welcome shot of energy to London's shows.</p></div>"
68,fall,2007,f2007,elie-saab,"Beyoncé radiating heat at the Golden Globes in his plunging metallic dress—proof positive that Elie Saab's name has been firmly established on the red carpet. Now, he's set his sights on after-dark occasions that don't necessarily entail a press line. There were eighties-ish one-sleeve billowy tops and stretch minis for nightclubbing, baby dolls in black lace for 21st-birthday parties, and long velvet dresses with blouson tops and bias-cut skirts for charity balls. Of course, you never know when you'll run into a camera—which explains the light-catching sequins that decorated so many looks, and why his faux leather (easier than the real stuff to embroider, apparently) had a shiny, wet, photo-ready look.</p><p>When he did go full-on glam, it was with emerald-green and violet crystals arrayed in sunburst patterns on a base of black. Out in Hollywood, of course, bare shoulders trumped sparkle at the Oscars, so a strapless black organza number with that faux leather accenting the bust looks like a bigger winner.</p><p>There were exactly zero pants on Saab's runway, and his shorts came in one length only: micro. What to make of the lack of real daywear, especially on the eve of the opening of his first Paris store? Put simply, Saab lives for the night, and so do his ladies.</p></div>"
69,fall,2007,f2007,elie-tahari,"Calling all latter-day Twiggys, Bardots, and Schneiders… Elie Tahari offered an updated take on mod shapes for Fall. ""I was inspired by the sleek industrial designs of the sixties,"" the designer said. That would explain the sage-green patent trench—quite striking in its shiny geometry—and the updated A-line shifts for work and play. A black-and-white tweed dress with pockets and leather trim had a get-down-to-business feel, while a color-block number layered over a turtleneck and leggings was just right for a Sunday brunch in Soho. Thankfully, Tahari mostly avoided the time-capsule trap; elements of the season—patent, feathers, and active-sportswear touches—were smoothly incorporated into a collection built around a clean sixties silhouette.</p></div>"
70,fall,2007,f2007,emanuel-ungaro,"Peter Dundas is getting more up-front about his direction for Ungaro: ¿I have always loved nightclubbing,¿ he says. Just a short hop away on the Paris-Waterloo Eurostar, London has an erupting Nu Rave club scene that he is clearly co-opting as a rationale for shaking off the rather suffocating ¿Jolie Madame¿ image that has been attached to Ungaro over the years.</p><p>At one remove, Dundas has plugged into all the trends that have been fueling the young London designers: the extreme shapes of Thierry Mugler¿s vast, rounded shoulders and funnel necks, the body-conscious early-nineties dressing, the exaggerated puffers, and sporty, plastic-clip fastened belts. Ungaro is a Parisian luxury house, though, so the designer¿s translation has a glossed-up French accent for a woman who is less likely to find her way to an East End club than to fly to the moon. Dundas' coiled, padded ""neo-puffers,"" spangled-sequin starburst microdresses, lip prints, and furs are ultimately more akin to the things young French girls might have seen their mothers wearing to Régine's in the seventies or the Bains Douches in the eighties than what impresses the Boombox crowd on a Friday night in Hoxton. Whether or not this will actually succeed in attracting today¿s wealthy international clubgoers remains to be seen, but, at the least, Dundas should be credited for understanding that Ungaro is in need of a thorough revamp if it¿s going to mean anything to a new generation.</p></div>"
71,fall,2007,f2007,emilio-pucci,"In a dark, dark season, the cumulative effect of Fall's shows makes the eye crave more of the punchy color that's been cropping up here and there. That could have been an opportunity for Matthew Williamson, who at Pucci is in charge of tweaking Italy's richest print archive. Today he took things in the general direction of the seventies, though his opening tableau announced that he had more on his mind than dealing with psychedelia: It comprised Popsicle-orange and -pink tunic dresses, short skirts, and A-line coats, all in plain felted wool.</p><p>When the print came, it was angular and geometric, based on a pattern Monroe once wore, or composed of rounded-off overlapping rectangles and, in one section, an architecturally derived scheme called ""Duomo."" All these were applied to skimpy jersey dresses and long caftans, liberally mixed with fur bombers and frizzy Mongolian lamb chubbies and styled with suede wedges and clunky, geometric cuffs.</p><p>If the intention was to demonstrate Pucci's push to become known as more than a maker of jazzy dresses, that's fair enough. The critical point, though, in this of all places, is whether the color choices are sufficiently spot-on to put Pucci in a position to mix with directional fashion. And that was the trouble: Somehow, none of Willamson's combinations of dusty pinks, purples, ochers, browns, and greens ever lifted themselves to the vivid level of the magentas, turquoises, electric blues, and oranges that are setting the pace right now. If he wants to get that right next season, he'll need help to fine-tune his palette.</p></div>"
72,fall,2007,f2007,emporio-armani,"Grown-up elegance is the Giorgio Armani signature—but he took his Emporio Armani collection in a decidedly more youthful direction. What with all the baby blues and Bazooka pinks and minidresses parading two and three at a time down the runway, it felt almost like prom night. The comparatively young models, sporting trompe l'oeil stockings that looked like knee socks, contributed to the overall effect.</p><p>Working in black, white, and gray mixed with pastels—and an airy silhouette strikingly similar to that of his main line, down to the pointy flats—Armani opened with a bubble skirt and jacket, a checkerboard fur shrug tossed over one shoulder. After that, he worked his way through a teenage army of tiny frocks: abbreviated A-lines, innocent baby dolls, and swingy trapezes accented with bows or crystals, some as bright as hard candy. Here, as in his signature line, he kept pants to the sidelines: The few pairs he did show were cropped and worn with abbreviated jackets left unbuttoned to expose the somewhat ill-advised bra tops, one sour note amid the show's nonstop sugar high.</p></div>"
73,fall,2007,f2007,erdem,"There was something in Erdem Moralioglu's program notes about Dumas' <em>La Dame aux Camélias</em> meeting Derek Jarman's <em>Jubilee</em>. Ignore it. Erdem enthusiasts should instead rush straight to the end of his collection. There, they'll find the cream of what he does, and it is, indeed, creamy: pretty concoctions whipped up in French lace and flowy fan-pleated tiers that somehow manage not to come over as sickly sweet.</p><p>These, along with billowy-sleeved poet blouses and long drop-waisted dresses, have emerged over four seasons as Erdem's signatures—and the more richly he lays on the effects, the better they look. In a conscious bid to add variety (and some pieces whose price tags might not make buyers blanch), he's also working with Mackintosh, the original British rainwear manufacturer, to bring interesting cuts to raincoats. Where he goes wrong is when he skimps. His opening dresses in his signature insect prints were spoiled by being too short and too tight—or maybe that was the punk influence. Either way, they were a mistake, because the wispy Erdem couldn't muster a punk gesture if his life depended on it. He should stay with romance, and push it as far as he can.</p></div>"
74,fall,2007,f2007,erin-fetherston,"To open, Erin Fetherston asked her friend Zooey Deschanel to croon the jazz standard ¿Dream a Little Dream of Me¿—a fitting gesture for a clothing line with a misty, otherworldly quality that can scarcely be written about without the use of the word <em>ethereal</em>.</p><p>Inspired by the George Méliès film <em>The Eclipse</em>, a slightly kooky, turn-of-the-century vision of outer space, Fetherston dubbed her Fall collection ¿Wandering Stars.¿ She twisted the night-sky motif into delicately sparkling tulles, floaty chiffons beaded with tiny stars, and jacquard patterned with bright silver moons. A silver satin coat with a padded collar captured both the space-age and romantic leanings of the show, as did the sequined cloches worn throughout.</p><p>Though Fetherston revisited many of last season's silhouettes (like the love-it-or-hate-it romper, the bell skirt, and the puff-sleeved princess gown), she says she is experiencing a touch of trapeze fatigue. As a panacea, she nipped wool jackets and dresses in at the waist, then flared them out to a ruffle. It wasn¿t groundbreaking, but it was nice to see an attempt at newness. Though the collection occasionally ventured toward the less-sophisticated side of girlish with a couple of Lurex pieces, it was a solid effort that will keep the growing Fetherston fan base more than happy.</p></div>"
75,fall,2007,f2007,etro,"Veronica Etro swapped the psychedelic sixties paisleys and magic-mushroom prints of Spring for twenties constructivism, with some timely Art Deco flash thrown in. The show opened with this season's by-now-familiar round-shouldered, short-sleeved coat with deep fur cuffs. Hers came in a natural linen tweed decorated with geometric blocks of color and slim saffron satin pants. From there, Etro started working the artsy (often over-the-top) layers: belted side-button tunic vests over pussy-bow silk-print blouses with willowy, high-waisted trousers; and a plaid anorak with a fur collar topping a purple pleated skirt with buckles at the sides. For evening, she showed drop-waist numbers, some with crystal embroidery at the hem, others beaded along the racer-back straps. Longer tank dresses were suspended from the shoulders with ropes of jet jewelry. A silk-velvet sack coat as vivid as a tapestry stood out for its simplicity.</p><p>No matter which decade is the inspiration, a rich interplay of prints and textures is the house's trademark; this season, though, Etro let that exuberance get the better of her. She isn't the only designer guilty of overlong presentations in Milan, but a more thorough edit, not to mention less flamboyant styling, could¿ve sharpened what she said was her message about languid sensuality.</p></div>"
76,fall,2007,f2007,fashion-east,"If London fashion week is a nursery of new talent, then Fashion East is the city's neonatal unit—a nice, warm (and free) place in which to prepare newborns to go it alone on the official runways. Louise Goldin, Danielle Scutt, and Henry Holland are currently sharing the incubator, and the reason visitors come to inspect them is that some of their predecessors, including Gareth Pugh, Marios Schwab, and Roksanda Ilincic, are now taking their first steps in their own right.</p><p>Henry Holland is the splashiest and newest of the three, and—as a former writer at the teen magazine <em>Bliss</em>—more of a rhymer, punner, and nu-rave limericksmith than a designer, per se. His naughtily worded T-shirts (""UHU GARETH PUGH,"" ""CAUSE ME PAIN HEDI SLIMANE,"" and other excruciating double entendres invoking the names of international and local frock makers) come from the Northern English tradition of George Formby via eighties Katharine Hamnett and the in-jokes of today's East End clubs. Given the chance to show on Fashion East's runway, Holland ran off some more neon-bright filth about models (""WHAM BAM THANK YOU STAM"" being the most repeatable), and then took a bow in a T-shirt that read ""ONE TRICK PONY."" Which shows he knows himself, but it also begs the question as to what happens when the joke's over. That'll be in five minutes, so if he wants to pop up next season, it'll have to be with a new device—and maybe with a friendly designer to help out with the shapes.</p><p>Danielle Scutt, the second designer in the lineup, hit a wobbly patch after the strong minicollection of power-dressing she sent out last season. This time, her inspirations were Joan Collins and pedigree dog shows, but even though she'd spent months researching and designing prints derived from dog hair, and cutting ironically boxy suits in bubble-gum pink and red, the results lacked the impact of her first show.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""8drjn""></div></div><p>It was Louise Goldin, a knit designer, who came out top of class. Her black-and-gray harlequin intarsias, some of which came with big head wraps, read in a way like an approachable version of Gareth Pugh's freak-show antics. That earned her kudos among the young editors present, no mean feat considering it's been a couple of generations since a sweater designer has been considered capable of cool. Of the three, Goldin's the one who seems ready to toddle out on her own.</p></div>"
77,fall,2007,f2007,fendi,"Although Fendi has been steadily building up a roster of regular fashion clothing, in winter it remains the one and only place to turn for the ne plus ultra of what can be done with fur and leather. So this time there were few distractions from the coats, which Karl Lagerfeld updated with all the news from the fashion vanguard. The first had almost every keynote compressed into it: the big collar, belted waist, full skirt, and wide sleeves; the black-and-white chinchilla stripes contrasted with voluminous fox. There followed a geometric patchwork jacket—another trend—and then caped suits and the ultimate example of the shaggy goat story of the season: a spiky cream belted coat-jacket with giant shoulders, sported by Carmen Kass.</p><p>That dealt with the out-and-out luxe side of things, but Lagerfeld also knowingly played with another subject du jour: the blurring of the line between natural and synthetic. That was visible in some of the leathers, but only on second inspection: A jacket that looked like a deconstructed quilted puffer that had been stitched together with rustle-y black trash-bag plastic squares was, of course, actually something else—the rarest handmade innovation of Italy's most advanced tanneries. Otherwise, the collection, with its brightly contrasting cartridge belts and turquoise and orange platforms, read as one of Lagerfeld's quick-minded summaries of all the trends so far, from major coats to accessible accessories.</p></div>"
78,fall,2007,f2007,salvatore-ferragamo,"A sparkling black trench, a herringbone suit fitted through the waist and worn with extra-wide cuffed trousers, a swingy coat in an exaggerated check…. Graeme Black at Ferragamo, like other Milan designers, traded in last season's curvaceous dresses for a more tailored expression. The Bourse, then, made a fitting, if perhaps a bit too obvious, setting for his new sharp and masculine focus. In fact, there was an overstated quality to the show's blown-out menswear patterns. Likewise the mirrored runway that provided multiple viewing angles for the house's raison d'être: platform sandals, wedges, and knee-high boots in gleaming crocodile (as well as structured totes and large envelope clutches done in the same).</p><p>Evening, naturally, was a more feminine affair. Black played up the back view, showing a long sequin dress with a triangular cutout between the shoulder blades and a velvet column that dipped behind from a beaded strap. The shorter crystal-embroidered dress that closed the show had a swingy A-line shape, and a sweet bow that peeked out above a scoop back. But in the end, its novel charm wasn't enough to rescue this collection from its overbearing beginnings.</p></div>"
79,fall,2007,f2007,gareth-pugh,"The buildup to the Gareth Pugh show had all the ingredients of the legendary British fashion happenings of the eighties and nineties: heaving tent packed with club kids and drag queens; major international editors present and correct; 80-minute wait just to get everyone steamed up. Part anticipation, part exasperation, it's a buzz that only descends when London's <em>on</em>, and Pugh's rubber-masked, cyber-freaky, balloon-bouncing theater is largely responsible for bringing back the excitement in this city. Without his ever having sold a stitch.</p><p>This time, though, he had a shock lined up: a collection of outstandingly constructed black and black-and-white coats, some in fur, intricately pieced together in contrasting stripes. ""I was sick of people saying, 'It's crazy,' "" said Pugh, backstage. As a designer, he's already established an influential shape—all those big, swathed, cowl-like necklines others are picking up on. Now he's working up exaggeratedly built-out shoulders he likens to <em>The Wicker Man</em>. Again, these look certain to be directional.</p><p>What really surprised, though, were the fur pieces—like a generously easy belted cardigan with a hood, and a black-and-white striped wrap-front short coat, and, later, a couple of chunky knitted coats banded in patent stripes. Any of these would attract envy rather than ridicule in the street. As for the styling—you still have to ignore the hair and makeup, and overlook the creepy section of see-through plastic stripes. Those were crowd-pleasers for Pugh's club-claque, but otherwise the boy is showing promising signs of outgrowing the thrill of being poor and mocked. ""I'm working with Kopenhagen Fur and having the coats made in Italy,"" he confided. ""And La Perla is making my stockings."" Which is quite a development for Pugh's detractors to mull at leisure.</p></div>"
80,fall,2007,f2007,giambattista-valli,"What do you get when you mix Rembrandt, Le Corbusier, and the Mexican film star María Félix? The new Fall collection by Giambattista Valli. From the painter (and perhaps from classic YSL, too) came the black suits—longer through the jacket, fuller through the leg, and more office-ready than anything the designer has shown before. The bold shots of yellow and red, geometric prints, and the new stiffer architecture found in Valli's favorite trapeze and bell shapes were derived from the great architect. And from La Doña, as she was called, he took the flourishes.</p><p>Valli's first love is a party dress. So Swarovski crystals studded the funnel necks of short frocks. Black-tipped white feathers were stitched together to create a showstopping weightless cape. And last season's masses of soft floral rosettes have become ribbon-candy ruffles—on one shift dress, they were horizontally arrayed to decorate the neckline; on another, they zipped up and down from neck to knee-length hem. From his new jewelry line, Valli showed large heart-shaped pendants emblazoned with skulls.</p><p>All of this gave Jessica Biel and the Euro socialite cohort in the front row plenty to ooh and aah over. What jazzes up the fashion types on the opposite side of the runway—aside from the obvious luxe of the fabrics and the fine construction—is how the cut-away-from-the-body silhouette seems both right for the season and completely of a piece with the exciting body of sophisticated work Valli is continuing to build.</p></div>"
81,fall,2007,f2007,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré's show notes explained that he began working on the Fall collection with androgyny on his mind, and today's presentation started promisingly, with clean black and navy-blue men's suits, the only feminine touches being the thin fastenings trailing loosely from the lapels of jackets. From there, though, he reverted to glamour-girl mode, turning out full-sleeved, sashed kimono jackets in all manner of fabrications (cashmere, astrakhan, that men¿s suiting fabric again), followed by sporty luxe parkas, some trimmed in fur. The layering on and embellishments reached a crescendo with a series of precious puffer vests in gold or silver, lined in fur.</p><p>His evening numbers were more streamlined, but no less dramatic—most of them were constructed from stiff metallics. Silk ""so thickly creased it almost resembles Chinese lantern paper,"" as his program explained, made for difficult going when the dresses descended to the floor. It took a real diva like Skin, the singer who closed the show and was scheduled to perform at the after-party, to pull off the look. The material worked better cut boxy and above-the-knee. But not half as well, it must be said, as those pantsuits at the show's beginning. It would¿ve been interesting to see Ferré go with his first instincts.</p></div>"
82,fall,2007,f2007,giles-deacon,"Giles Deacon has always been a nature-lover, and after a few virtual flying expeditions via Google Earth, he was off on his Fall theme. It came to encompass earthy forest-floor colors, porcupine quills, leaves, tribal prints, Chinese pheasant feathers, and, along the way, a showpiece constructed of fans that may be fashion¿s first-ever dress based on a sea cucumber.</p><p>As always in a Giles collection, though, the starting point is never where things end up. ¿We just add and add and go mad, and we got on a real roll this time,¿ was the best explanation he had for the anti-method that produced a duchesse satin gown jigsawed together from 550 pattern pieces, a leather sheath decorated with grommets, gargantuan knitwear, a <em>coq</em>-feather bolero, and a puffy ball gown sprouting extravagant tail feathers.</p><p>It makes for an expansive show with links that are perplexing to follow, until you realize that none really exist. Deacon¿s increasingly complex, handworked clothes are best considered individually, just as they are rendered in his studio, with prints and embroideries, corsetry, and padding applied by a small army of friends. No big thrusting vision, then; but a sense that a jolly good time was had by all who made it.</p></div>"
83,fall,2007,f2007,giorgio-armani,"A giant, globe-traveling retrospective of Giorgio Armani's three-decade-long career finally touches down in Milan this week. And the jackets on his runway today were not unworthy heirs to the many timeless variations in that exhibition. Some curved around the torso in natty tweed, others came with pert peplums. One, cut in gray leather embossed to look like crocodile, blousoned at the waist. These he showed not with his signature pants, but with multiple versions of a slim skirt with a soft drape a few inches above the knee—a look he finished with flats for a youthful, modern feel.</p><p>Formal eveningwear, which is so well represented at the La Triennale show, was likewise notably absent here. Armani showed just one gown, embroidered with new Swarovski crystals cut to his specifications—an effect that was glittering if a bit stiff. Cocktail dresses with intricately beaded bodices and softly ballooning skirts in the palest of pastels were effervescent by comparison. They worked well when their harnesslike straps were made from delicate jet crystal. As for red-carpet showstoppers, it seems the designer is saving those for the Oscars this Sunday, not to mention the just announced Armani Privé presentation in Los Angeles at the weekend.</p></div>"
84,fall,2007,f2007,givenchy,"Riffing in a straightforward way on the naval theme that he'd more opaquely alluded to in his Spring Couture show, Riccardo Tisci sent out his most concise and focused ready-to-wear collection yet for Givenchy. All it took, according to his program notes, was a Japanese marine jacket circa the 1920's.</p><p>Coats and jackets looked particularly strong. A navy fur with a deep, rich pile was the very essence of opulence. Easier to wear, and sure to sell by the boatload, were the fitted peacoats and blazers, including a few winners with face-framing collars cut to look like oversize ribbons.</p><p>Skirts came long and lean and trailing fishtail hems, while black dresses were wrapped asymmetrically about the body. For trousers, Tisci showed two distinct styles: The first was essentially a sailor pant, high-waisted and narrow through the thigh, then flaring dramatically at the ankle; the less said about the droopy leather drawers, the better.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""h5v4mf""></div></div><p>In short, all wasn't perfect. The brass buttons that decorated dresses and coats in Art Deco patterns will, for those who want to wear them beyond the runway, be better in smaller doses. The twisting and pleated pink party frocks seemed out of place among the predominantly black and navy palette. And the white opaque hosiery and glittery heels were styling missteps. But all in all, Tisci has really improved. Good for him.</p></div>"
85,fall,2007,f2007,gucci,"When Frida Giannini showed pretty, forties-influenced, floral-printed silk dresses and blouses in her first collection for Gucci, they were a commercial hit. This Fall, after veering through glam-rock disco and last summer's folkloric frocks, she returned to vintage-inspired dressmaking. ""I've been reading a biography of Lee Miller, a woman who started off as a model, became a friend of the surrealists and then a war photographer for British <em>Vogue</em>—a strong woman with two sides to her,"" she explained, adding, ""I was thinking about the dresses of the thirties and forties, with high waists and emphasis on the shoulder.""</p><p>As a new proposition for Gucci in a less sexed-up era, the dresses worked. Giannini dropped the print and worked on a silhouette with puffed shoulders and narrow, long sleeves that hit the right note of covered-up femininity, albeit with little peeks of plunging neckline or naked back—this is still Gucci, after all. Since the idea of the forties is gaining traction this season, these dresses—especially the black finale glamour gowns with Schiaparelli-esque sun-ray embroideries at the shoulder—steered this part of the collection in line with the general direction of fashion at large.</p><p>By contrast, tweedy knickers and vaguely Tyrolean jackets in the daywear section seemed more out on a limb, and the big duffel tote—wielded as the season's must-have bag—missed the ineffable quality of ""It,"" no matter how insistently it was shown. There were eye-catching pieces, though, like a tiny burgundy suede bomber trimmed with leather, inspired by Gucci's seventies archive, and a couple of assertively patchworked furs aimed squarely at the tastes of the brand's die-hard rock-chick faithful.</p></div>"
86,fall,2007,f2007,haider-ackermann,"""I wanted to take a motorcycle and escape to Tibet,"" said Haider Ackermann, the peripatetic Colombian-born, Belgian-trained designer whose subtle, sometimes stark clothes are still flying under the radar in the U.S.</p><p>With this rather abstract concept in mind, Ackermann layered and draped leathers, suedes, and velvets in a deep palette of plums, sage greens, and grays. The most challenging of his looks was a tunic that twisted and bunched at the waist: not an easy area to wear extra fabric (""for some it will be too heavy,"" he admitted backstage). Modified biker jackets with zippers that twisted from one shoulder to the opposite hip were more user-friendly.</p><p>The jersey dresses that floated to the floor from gathered and ruched necklines were dramatic in an unembellished, perhaps almost monastic, way. Ackermann was at his best working in this idiom of austerely cool draping. When he added details to the collection's more tailored pieces, though, the results were slightly off: Bands of sequins on walking shorts, and a pair of chiffon pants with a gathered hem, worn over another pair of shorts, were impractical and fussy. That said, a bronze one-button suit was sexy and edgy and way too sophisticated for the windswept wilds of Tibet .</p></div>"
87,fall,2007,f2007,hamish-morrow,"There is an odd aspect to Hamish Morrow's determinedly modernistic approach that's quite hard to make out. For a start, he delivered the first half of his show with such a brutal assault of sound that it felt like an act of aggression toward his audience. The brain-piercing noise didn't match the visual, though: There was nothing too shocking in the black asymmetrically cut coats and jackets that turned to show a hole in the back. Nor did the rubber coat that came later seem particularly calculated to scandalize, though there was a fair bit of nudging and smirking in the ranks as it went by.</p><p>What none of this conceptual posturing really covered up is the fact that Morrow's natural talent lies in designing quietly sophisticated pieces for an older woman, pieces like his padded, high-belted, subtly luxe duchesse satin jackets and the dress with a scarf-draped asymmetry at the neck (a theme that's surfacing elsewhere in London). He ended the show with a lot more ""editorial"" ideas about duvets, but what's the point of a down gown with a cutaway back? No one wants Morrow to stop being creative, yet he's passed beyond the stage of life when credibility comes from being edgy and angry. If he'd only get over that, he might understand that people actually value his simplest design gestures most—because nobody else is doing stuff like that.</p></div>"
88,fall,2007,f2007,heatherette,"Since they launched their collection eight years ago, designers Richie Rich and Traver Rains have defied expectations and steadily built a business out of their cartoony, club-kid gear. Two years ago they partnered with investors the Weisfeld Group. And last year, the label that once didn't dare dream of seeing a selling floor even spun off a lower-priced line, now carried in over a hundred stores and its own in-store boutique at Macy's in Herald Square.</p><p>That said, Rich and Rains haven't lost an iota of the outrageously kooky spirit that makes entering the world of Heatherette a bit like dropping down a psychedelic rabbit hole. This season, it was a madcap take on <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> titled ""Over the Rainbow,"" with their perennial muses cast in starring roles. Amanda Lepore took the role of the Good Witch Glenda, while Dorothy was played by Lydia Hearst, outfitted aptly for the role except for the racket bag on her arm. (The latter, a limited-edition piece from Puma's French 77 collection, is the fruit of a design collaboration between Hearst and Heatherette—even a muse needs to market herself.) As always, amid the mad mix of deconstructed, reconstructed looks were some real clothes. A banded skirt over a pale blouse didn't make much sense, but a stiff black skirtsuit embellished with oversize googly eyes somehow worked. Ultimately, though, what will get their fans shopping is the series of block-lettered T-shirts that closed the show, with sayings like ""WE'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE"" and ""IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN.""</p></div>"
89,fall,2007,f2007,hermes,"Jean Paul Gaultier skipped the dockside mise-en-scène of last season's Hermès presentation and concentrated strictly on the clothes. Good move. From the first look (a black crocodile bomber over a ruffle-hemmed pencil skirt) to the last (the same jacket, this time buffed to a high sheen, tossed over one shoulder of a long silk dress), the designer was at his hyper-focused best. Every single superluxe piece exuded the faultless elegance that is the brand's calling card.</p><p>He started with ultrasoft leather outerwear—peacoats, swing coats, and tail coats. He worked his way through tweedy brown suits, Fair Isle cardigans, and sweater dresses in warm autumn hues. He riffed on a man's tuxedo. If the knit leggings he showed with many of the looks meant that his clients may have to go elsewhere for their pants, there was no shortage of accessories, from biker caps (some in sheared fur) to over-the-knee boots. Gaultier's amusing takes on the house's signature Kelly bag included soft, foldable suede versions, miniature crocodile styles, and the oversize number he came galloping out with himself.</p><p>Rounding out the show were draped gowns in velvet dévoré or chiffon topped by grand, floor-sweeping trenches. The ne plus ultra came in matte forest-green crocodile. A conspicuously ostentatious moment, no doubt, but the designer had more than earned this little indulgence with the smart, rich, classic clothes that came before.</p></div>"
90,fall,2007,f2007,iceberg,"To the average American fashion customer, Iceberg is still a bit of an unknown quantity. But with the benefit of some creative input from Giambattista Valli, a stablemate at parent company Gilmar, the Italian label is doing its best to change that. The Fall collection tapped into some key trends, starting with the quilted cocoon coat that opened the show. Other strong outerwear included a fur-trim army-green parka with sporty glamour to spare, and a puffer jacket in safety-orange tucked and folded into this season¿s capelike shape. Mongolian lamb chubbies were on target, too, save for the superfluous contrasting color straps that cinched the torso.</p><p>There were a few too many tricky details like those. The sashes crisscrossing oversize cowl-neck sweaters, and the decorative resin chips fastened to a miniskirt, weighed things down. But the unstructured eveningwear was refreshingly simple (the best being an asymmetric-strap goddess dress). All in all, this collection should help bump the brand identity up a notch.</p></div>"
91,fall,2007,f2007,isaac-mizrahi,"""Spring is the new fall!"" Isaac Mizrahi mock-declared in an interview a few days before his show, which he had titled Frozen Spring. ""I want something that feels like spring, something light and seasonless. It makes me sad to look at the same old tweeds.""</p><p>Mizrahi's optimistic alternatives for the tweedy season were largely executed in winter whites and dazzling brights: big Day-Glo flower prints; a showstopping fit-and-flare gown called ""Psychopeach"" that brought Grace Kelly to mind; and lavish gala dresses with less-than-practical petticoats of snow-white mink.</p><p>The designer, whose ultra-luxe line is carried exclusively at Bergdorf Goodman, insists he's ""not in the sportswear business anymore."" Still, the looks that worked best here were the ones that didn't demand a grand occasion. In keeping with the American-casual tradition, he offered a series of calf-length, bell-shaped ""skating skirts"" with fur-trimmed hems (let's not mention the accompanying white leggings), as well as an easy long gray-jersey dress with beading at the wrist that really hit home.</p></div>"
92,fall,2007,f2007,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel's front row is always a photographer's dream. Today it was studded not just with Patrick McMullan's favorite New Yorkers (Dr. Lisa Airan, Helen Lee Schifter, Jennifer Creel) but also with a gaggle of stars who live in a red-carpet world (Céline Dion, Cynthia Nixon, Natasha Richardson). It's hard to imagine any of them walking away from this show without a wish list.</p><p>""This collection is not about colors, but textures,"" Mendel said. And so, restricting his palette to ivory, slate, and ""blacks of many shades,"" he focused on a silhouette he described as ""post-war."" Mendel isn't known for day looks, but he did some very viable, unapologeticallly dressy office options, like suits (pant and skirt) with fitted jackets and a tweed sheath that hit above the knee. His clients go to him mainly, though, for photo-op looks. He delivered these in spades. Glamour gowns featured interesting contrasts. A wrap number, for example, had pleated chiffon on one side and silk satin on the other. The finale piece—backless, cap-sleeved black velvet with patent trim—was long on glamour and begging to be worn by a modern-day Madame X.</p><p>The minks and chinchillas were also very glam (quite naturally, from a firm that once was exclusively a furrier). Kim Noorda looked every inch the snow princess in a white lamb coat with a halo of a fox hood. And there was a very J. Mendel take on the coat-with-contrasting-sleeves trend: It came cinched at the waist, with two kinds of black fur on the body and full, silvery Old Hollywood sleeves.</p></div>"
93,fall,2007,f2007,jason-wu,"Jason Wu is earning his wings. In a few short seasons, he's defined his customer and garnered attention from key press (<em>Vogue</em>) and retailers (Saks Fifth Avenue) along the way. This show should help speed his upward trajectory.</p><p>Though still more deb than Kate Moss (one of Wu's alleged muses), Fall was discernibly edgier than previous seasons. A strapless cocktail piece and several belted coats were dressed down in a fine basket-weave fabric that mimicked dark denim. Metal buttons peeked from beneath plackets, half-exposed for a bit of whimsy, and the lines of a potentially stuffy dress were broken in the back with soft pleats. Wu's strength is his immaculate tailoring—a solid foundation for beautiful clothing. Look for young socials and starlets to start appearing in his front row sooner rather than later.</p></div>"
94,fall,2007,f2007,jean-paul-gaultier,"You've got to hand it to him. Just as spirits were sagging and minds were reaching the fashion-saturation point, Jean Paul Gaultier sent out model Coco Rocha in a red jacket and tartan kilt with a plume of feathers in her hair to perform a high-stepping Celtic dance. It was hard to match that first moment for sheer pleasure, but he mostly succeeded, with a collection straight out of the Scottish Highlands (cue the <em>Braveheart</em> sound track).</p><p>After Rocha's little jig came brightly hued, oversize plaids. The most novel example was a fuzzy angora skirt worn with an oxblood python motorcycle jacket. In a switch from last season's sportif mood, the luxe quotient was high. Colorful argyles were knitted not from wool but sheared mink. What earned the most cheers was a set of timely mixed-material coats in plaid taffeta spliced with fox fur dyed to match. Trenches were absolutely dizzying in their variety: Some came in leather, others discreetly edged or lined in it; a few seemed to sport built-in, utilitarian backpacks.</p><p>The only really major misstep was the pointless lacy face coverings: These elaborate crochets looked much lovelier when they turned up as softly draped dresses.</p></div>"
95,fall,2007,f2007,jens-laugesen,"During his break from the London runway, Jens Laugesen wasn't idle: He went off to Paris and won himself the €55,000 ANDAM fellowship, sponsored by LVMH. Now he's back with a collection that showed how he's moved on from where he left off. He's still recognizably the designer who was obsessed by strict, black Helmut Lang-ish urbanism, but now things are calibrated a few more degrees toward the feminine and flouncy.</p><p>Caped coats and short flared skirts—of the ilk of the minicrini/skating skirt/dirndl seen elsewhere in London—proved Laugesen is fully locked onto the trend radar. His silhouettes, either a long, lean streak in leggings or that nip-waisted full skirt, had high necklines with stock ties, and zones of techno-sparkle worked into them (the leather jodhpurs, we won't discuss).</p><p>For evening, he pursued his favorite black even more relentlessly. There were some good tuxedo looks and a fine white cotton pie-frill-necked shirt, but then it all went on a good ten minutes too long. Surprisingly for a career minimalist, Laugesen hasn't learned the art of brevity. The odd but true fact is that audiences can sometimes like a collection more, the less they see of it.</p></div>"
96,fall,2007,f2007,jeremy-laing,"A designer who eschews living in a major fashion hub in favor of his native Toronto might be construed as a designer who goes his own way. Add to this stints at Alexander McQueen and Preen, and you could reasonably expect from him over-the-top showmanship or darkly avant-garde experimentation. But that's not Jeremy Laing's bag.</p><p>Instead, Laing—27 and showing his third collection in New York—presented a sober selection of smartly tailored dresses, suits, and separates in a muted palette of grays and greens. You had to look closely to see where Laing lets loose. It's all in the finer details: architectural constructions (a boxy, faceted hitch at a neckline instead of darting, for instance) or a kaleidoscopic crystal print (created from a blown-up digital photo). This detailing knocked classic silhouettes—pouf-skirted party frocks, drawstring dresses, and slouchy suits—slightly askew, and pushed what might otherwise have been ho-hum into the realm of cool.</p></div>"
97,fall,2007,f2007,jil-sander,"Jil Sander may be the last designer resource for alpha-female corporate dressing left unbowed in the twenty-first century—it's certainly the only one that dares to air a full range of navy pantsuits on a runway. That unflinching Belgian pragmatism regarding the need for upper-echelon career clothes has, after three seasons, become Raf Simons' brand-stabilizing trademark, alongside the stamp of calm conceptualism he's bringing to the house.</p><p>The show opened with a new, almost monastic, close-cut cape with a rounded shoulder, after which Simons reiterated the silhouette of narrow body-line coats and jackets with attenuated skinny pants, ballasting them, as before, with heavy black platforms. The variation among the plain blues and grays came in a few futuristic shot metallics, which broke out more delicately in a silver accordion-pleated dress for evening.</p><p>The effect of all this was to make the eye search for the new points. Simons has added some terrific ribbed knits with little turned-down collars, including a maroon sweater dress. Most of the innovation, however, was concentrated in the intelligent minutiae. For example, he made the simple combination of a green skirt and a matching skinny, high-neck sweater look interesting by adding a wrapped-band waistline.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""za1c8""></div></div><p>Simons' dresses, too, have incisive economy of cut, like an otherwise plain short-sleeve boardroom sheath with a single off-center vertical raised tuck. That made the collection solid on go-to-work daywear, but for evening there were also outstanding pieces: a one-shouldered white sheath, and a little black velvet dress modernized with a pair of tramline seams in front. Those developments, along with three elegantly asymmetrical flyaway dresses, lent a degree of uplift to the conclusion of a businesslike message.</p></div>"
98,fall,2007,f2007,jill-stuart,"Showing at her usual venue, the grand New York Public Library, Jill Stuart seemed just a touch breathless. Perhaps it's because chez Stuart there's quite a bit to talk about. Her debut men's collection, named Stuart Curtis, is about to hit stores for spring. She just launched Jill, a lower-priced collection meant to deliver her flirty fare to a younger customer. And she recently signed a licensing deal with Tim Schifter to make handbags, one of which (a luscious, oversize black patent shopper) she modeled for the backstage crowd.</p><p>Out on the runway, Fall found Stuart back in a favorite haunt: the vintage store. This time she was working in the reliably fertile Swinging Sixties spirit of Emma Peel, Françoise Hardy, and Twiggy. Somehow, unlike other blasts from the past (the Roaring Twenties, say), the bold colors and clean shapes of that era tend not to feel as bogged down in a mire of nostalgia.</p><p>Despite a few overly literal interpretations of Courrèges or Paco Rabanne, Stuart kept her leggy minidresses, skinny pants, and boxy little jackets fresh and relevant to the modern customer. Still, the show soon lapsed into repetitive territory: Stuart could have made her point more strongly with fewer looks.</p></div>"
99,fall,2007,f2007,john-galliano,"It's a vintage season for John Galliano—in more ways than one. At Dior, he celebrated the 60th anniversary of the New Look in high movie-star style. Then his own decadently staged collection returned to the romantic, excessive, eccentric hothouse scenes people so adored him for in the early nineties, complete with ""vintage"" Galliano bias-cut dresses. The notion of entertaining fashion audiences as guests and treating models like individuals has become such a forgotten art that the arrivals at the show—greeted with a cast of made-up Parisian street characters, overflowing dinner tables, potted palms, dogs, chicken coops, Turkish rugs, bordello couches, and an unmade brass bed—were instantly put in party mood. We were in Pigalle during the tens and twenties—the world of Kiki de Montparnasse and Brassai's Madame Bijou.</p><p>And there were the girls, striking totally convincing attitudes, as if no one could teach them a thing about absinthe drinking or streetwalking. Who knew this supposedly blank generation of Sashas, Lilys, and Cocos had it in them to act up like a bunch of old-school supermodels? That, like the clothes, seemed a flashback to everything that made Galliano good in his first years in Paris. The theme sent him off on an orgy of costume reference (and self-reference) that brought out deep-red Poiret-era coats whorled into asymmetric rose ruffles, gigantic leg-of-mutton-sleeved jackets, high-waisted redingotes, flower-printed tea dresses, and a multiplicity of his signature bias-cut gowns, in everything from black velvet and sheer lace to face-powder pink and dusty-tangerine chiffon.</p><p>The roll of credits included Stephen Jones' millinery, Pat McGrath's makeup, Julien d'Ys hair, and Michael Howells' set design. All played crucial supporting roles in bringing Galliano gloriously back to full cinematic form. Was there anything new here? Well, yes, in the way the show touched the Poiret sensation of the season; then again, no—but perhaps that was exactly the point. If the early nineties are a reference point in fashion now, here was Galliano, bringing himself back for a new generation—and judging by the way those 20-year-olds got into it, they're ready for every ruffle and cloche the man can throw their way.</p></div>"
100,fall,2007,f2007,jonathan-saunders,"""That is what modern is meant to be!"" one influential American retailer called out as he left Jonathan Saunders' show. ""And wouldn't it be great to see an Oscar girl in a gown like that?"" He was raving about the remarkable, vertically pieced, linear dresses at the end of the show—either asymmetrically sliced patchworks of solids and zones of print, or dark columns with narrow triangles of fluid chiffon flowing in front, tethered to the waist with contrast belts.</p><p>Their graphic energy and athletic presence would certainly make a woman stand tall and distinguished in a red-carpet herd—or any other, come to that. The same went for most of the daywear: coats and dresses also constructed from narrow panels of royal blue and black, sometimes with an inset of white-and-beige stripes and contrasting horizontals to emphasize the waist.</p><p>Saunders said he'd developed the idea partly from looking at the linear stripes in the work of the artist Daniel Buren. The clever thing was the way he manipulated material and color to completely flattering effect. By reducing his vivid dégradé and scribbly textured prints to strips running center-front, he made each dress look willow-slim. It was a huge stride forward for this young designer, marking his transition from a genius printmaker to someone who is beginning to manipulate shape in an ingenious contemporary manner.</p></div>"
101,fall,2007,f2007,jovovich-hawk,"Entering the Gramercy Park Hotel, it was easy to spot Milla Jovovich and Carmen Hawk. You just had to look for the throng of photographers elbowing one another for a chance to capture the rakishly glamorous design team. It was a far cry from the days when they invited friends over to Jovovich's Greenwich Avenue town house for scones, tea, and dresses. ""We've just had so much support,"" said Jovovich in her sweet, raspy voice.</p><p>There was still, actually, a sense of home in the setting. Three scenes were arranged with gilt-edged mirrors, chaise longues, and Chinese screens to look like a place where a flapper might hang her cloche.</p><p>Ideas and images were snatched from various places—the avant-garde films of Kenneth Anger and Roxy Music album covers—but, ultimately, Jovovich-Hawk always comes back to grandmother's attic. There were plenty of their reliably floaty dresses in beaded chiffon, but there was sturdier stuff, too: a little black wool suit edged in bugle beads, and frame bags with braided handles, some beaded, some patchworked. One striped suit, in fact, was so lean and mean it looked less granny and more grand-old Keith Richards.</p></div>"
102,fall,2007,f2007,junya-watanabe,"After a season of dressed-up eighteenth-century dandy formality, Junya Watanabe took it down again for Fall, returning to rework a different classic register—biker, instead of Beethoven. (He called it ""Romantic in Black."") Essentially, it was a show of little riffs up and down the scale of fabric and construction/deconstruction, the sort of riffs that have become familiar at the house of Comme des Garçons over the years—i.e., stiff leather (real and fake), overdyed viscose, school-uniform knits, polka dots, asymmetry, and the hybridization of garments.</p><p>It wasn't one of Watanabe's confrontational punk war cries—more of a teen-rebel look with a softer side. This is for a girl who will pull on a flower-print dress (albeit one she's boil-washed with several loads of black) with her leather jacket, a shrunken cardigan, and a pair of pointy biker-cum-Western boots. In many dresses, the cardigan was fused in and wrapped at the back, sending the frock's pretty lines of tucks and minute ruffles off-kilter. Overall, there was plenty to appreciate, such as the way Watanabe manipulated those unbending leathers: here, to make a zipper ripple down the front of a jacket to echo a frill-front shirt; there, to pick out a fitted fishtail of Alaïa-like seaming in the back of a waisted coat. Look at this as a collection of young, casual separates, and it doesn't take any leap of imagination to see how these pieces will sell, but then again, this wasn't one of those Watanabe shows that provokes its audience to think any big thoughts.</p></div>"
103,fall,2007,f2007,just-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli's glamazons all but disappeared from his signature collection last season in favor of a softer kind of beauty. But they were out in full force at his Just Cavalli show today, alongside ski bunnies, biker chicks, and what one editor called toy poodles—a reference to the no doubt unwitting effect produced by one too many pairs of fur-trimmed ankle booties and miles of bare leg.</p><p>From the barely decent bubble minis in candy brights to superskinny pants laced up the calves or cinched with bondage straps, there was nothing tame about this show. Even cable-knit sweaters fell suggestively from bare shoulders. Oversize knits like shrugs and cardigans—often layered over denim or metallic leather jackets—played a starring role, as did fur hoods, capes, and boleros. Particularly racy was a snug black bomber lined in white shearling with a matching short skirt. Yes, Cavalli was up to his old tricks, and the 24-hour partywear inevitably came off as much too much for the pared-down crowd. The designer's riposte might be that it's working at retail: A Just Cavalli flagship is set to open on Fifth Avenue in New York this summer, and 15 additional U.S. stores are planned for the next 18 months.</p></div>"
104,fall,2007,f2007,kai-kuhne,"""I'm German. I like things to be on time,"" rasped Kai Kühne, trying to explain that he was as frustrated as everyone else by the late, late start (an hour and twenty minutes, to be precise) of today's show. It wasn't just the lapse in Prussian punctuality that made it clear Kühne is experiencing some growing pains. He is by his own admission still recovering from his difficult divorce from As Four, now rechristened Threeasfour, three seasons ago. And, as of this week, he also finds himself in the vulnerable circumstance of being between publicists.</p><p>Kühne described his collection, at times emotionally, as a coming to terms with that past and with growing up. True to his word, it did come across as his most mature to date. He lightened up his ornate ""German origami"" technique and produced chic <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em> dresses and an elegant shantung evening coat. Furs, in collaboration with Saga, boosted the luxury level.</p><p>Of course, this being the occasionally outrageous Kai, it wasn't all serious. A sculpted cable-knit jumpsuit and a coat crafted entirely from striped Hudson Bay blankets provided a dollop of wit. And as an apt exclamation mark for a designer who says he aspires to show at the Haute Couture in Paris one day, he closed today's slightly fraught proceedings with a bride in an ivory cotton-and-silk column striped with marabou.</p></div>"
105,fall,2007,f2007,karen-walker,"For her second show in New York, New Zealander Karen Walker chose as her muse a thirties comic-book superheroine, one who leads a double life. Such a whimsical starting point could have translated into runway disaster, but Walker knows how to finesse a slightly off-kilter theme. Pretty caped sleeves on printed blouses and dresses subtly echoed standard-issue superhero fare. The designer likes to pair masculine with feminine, and here she cut menswear wools into Depression-era silhouettes of the sort that once populated Katharine Hepburn's closet. These were layered with Lycra pieces in a graphic lightning-bolt print, adding a fresh pop of humor to the serious tailoring.</p><p>Along the way, Walker managed to weave in several disparate elements—from bright nylon anoraks to a covetable but relatively plain-Jane black day dress—without producing the jarring feeling of a phone-booth quick-change. A year in, this designer is already establishing herself as another exciting part of the city's growing fashion expat contingent.</p></div>"
106,fall,2007,f2007,karl-lagerfeld,"Of the three labels Karl Lagerfeld heads up, the one that bears his own name is, if not necessarily the closest to his heart, then the closest to his own closet. There was something vaguely military and distinctly mannish about the black and blue and army-drab tailored pieces and the flat new-wave boots with which they were worn. Compared with the funnel-neck coats and the boxy jackets, with their strong rounded shoulders, an abbreviated shirtdress that flared over short shorts and a jumper with a tucked bubble hem looked refreshingly female.</p><p>What kept the collection from going over to the dark side were the kittenish accessories: fishnet underpinnings, lace stockings, and neon driving gloves (fingerless, natch) with talonlike press-on nails. And while it was executed with martial austerity, Lagerfeld didn¿t completely resist the temptation to embellish. A pair of sexy sheaths were a graphic mix of matte and shine. And tulle dresses (ranging from a blouson to a long halter to a sleeveless shift worn over skinny pants) were embroidered with sequins in patches. Nothing masculine about that.</p></div>"
107,fall,2007,f2007,l-wren-scott,"First in Paris, now in New York, L¿Wren Scott has settled on a striking mode of presentation for her small but powerful collections. The gallery she opted for this time was Marianne Boesky in Chelsea, and the all-white space provided a pristine backdrop for clothes that had something of the night about them. Look at Scott¿s palette: black accented by a rich burgundy she said was named ""Too Much Blood."" The attenuated silhouettes matched. Each dress was tailored to within an inch of the model's life, the single overt detail—a buttoning kick pleat, a fishtail of tulle at the hem—slyly suggestive, perhaps, of a kink in the wearer¿s personality.</p><p>The tailcoats elongated the body still further, spectacularly so in the case of one in leather that demanded candlelight and a country estate. A capelet gathered at the back and a coat with lace tails trailing away over a jet mermaid dress similarly set one¿s head spinning with visions of dark romance.</p><p>Scott¿s experience as a stylist means she is used to cramming a single outfit with as much import as she can muster. It showed in the precise luxury of each of her looks. ¿This is the way <em>everyone</em> should dress on the red carpet,¿ enthused Ellen Barkin.</p></div>"
108,fall,2007,f2007,la-perla,"Eveningwear was a natural brand extension for the Italian lingerie maker La Perla. But its designer, Alessandro Dell¿Acqua—who is maintaining a very low profile at the label, not even coming out for the requisite post-show bow—is beginning to turn the line into a believable all-around resource. To wit, he sent out a sexy day suit and fur coats (in something the company has been calling ¿kidassian¿) that looked like they might have been plucked from the closet of Kate Moss.</p><p>If anything, it was the gowns that came out looking a little complicated. That was certainly the case with the lace bustier that peeked from beneath fans and folds of black crepe, not to mention a long number with raw-edged panels overlaid atop one another to create an interplay of sheer and opaque. (Some of the separates were likewise tricked out with crystals, feathers, and other potentially clunky bells and whistles.) But a cocktail-length goddess dress, draped from the shoulder to expose the underworkings of a push-up bra, displayed a lighter hand and looked like a lot more fun. Ditto a liquid-copper strapless style with a panel of black lace inset in the back.</p><p>As for that standout skirtsuit, it came in unadorned alpaca, this season¿s must-have luxe fabric. More of this sort of thing, and people will want to start paying the collection closer attention.</p></div>"
109,fall,2007,f2007,lacoste,"A yellow Citroën with a LACOSTE license plate stood at one end of the leaf-strewn catwalk—having, in imagination, just whisked a bevy of bourgeois beauties away to Brittany for a getaway at the coast. To build excitement around the classic basics that are the foundation of the House of the Alligator, creative director Christophe Lemaire has relied heavily on elaborate sets and scenarios, and this time he was romancing the idea of <em>le week-end</em>, as depicted in French cinema à la Yves Montand and Romy Schneider.</p><p>Lemaire does not claim to be a revolutionary; his aim, he says, is to make clothes that are evermore ¿precise, refined, and luxurious.¿ To that end, he offered some good youthful options (knit minis and crepe-heeled granny boots) as well as a few grown-up looks that Schneider might have loved (the knit kimono coats and voluminous capes).</p><p>There were lots of desirable separates that fairly screamed ¿fall¿—a loden microduffel, belted Annie Hall blazers, a slick rubberized burgundy raincoat. The latter had an undeniable <em>je ne sais quoi</em>, but at times things got a bit syrupy and over-Frenchified. One too many berets made an appearance. And when a trio of models with choreographed smiles marched out toting French novels, cinema magazines, and an artist¿s portfolio, you sensed it was time to pack up the Citroën and start the journey home.</p></div>"
110,fall,2007,f2007,lanvin,"""After last season,"" explained Alber Elbaz, ""we sat in the studio and asked ourselves, 'Where do you go after futurism?' And someone said to me, 'You want to go home.' So then I went back and started looking at Jeanne Lanvin's sketches again."" What Elbaz came across was a sheaf of illustrations of Lanvin's wide-shouldered thirties gowns and that was enough to set him off on a path of intense cutting research, which led to one of the strongest advances in modern dressing to come out of the Paris shows. ""It's all in the sleeve,"" he said.</p><p>Technical construction details sound dull on paper, and too often designerly innovation ends up beyond the realm of the sanely wearable. But in pushing his broad-shouldered look, Elbaz applied both scissors and his sensitivity to most women's morbid fears about its last go-round, viz., the Sue Ellen eighties. His solution is an aerated shoulder volume without pads, something akin to a leg-of-mutton, but actually without historical precedent. It came on washed duchesse-satin shifts, belted jackets, techno-nylon coats, and a delicious ivory charmeuse blouse.</p><p>That striking silhouette formed the core of the collection, but Elbaz didn't leave it there. His other contribution to the growing desire for concise but luxurious design (we have to think of something to call it other than minimalism) was in dresses that were sexily wrapped from single lengths of fabric. Often deceptively sober in front, they draped through the hip and got caught up in back with an asymmetric frill running the length of the spine, or turned to show a little upthrust scroll of peplum in the small of the back.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""5b9vz""></div></div><p>As for the out-and-out-luxe side of Lanvin, which so many women adore, Elbaz had that well covered. Some of his rigorous sleeveless dresses had the darts and seams picked out in jewels, and then there were the furs, ingeniously calculated to deconstruct into separate vests, scarves, and techno-look undercoats. This is smart thinking from so many angles that its true ingenuity can only be appreciated in front of a mirror in a changing room. And that, really, is how Alber Elbaz likes to speak to women—rather than from the lofty vantage point of the runway.</p></div>"
111,fall,2007,f2007,lela-rose,"Lela Rose caught the current mood for sportswear, cutting glorified sweatshirts in cashmere and tossing in menswear fabrics for an extra edge. It was a smart move, because the full volumes of the girlish trapeze dresses that have become her specialty threaten to look like last season¿s trend. Still, the Texan designer hasn't forgotten what made fans of social types like Celerie Kemble and Amanda Cutter Brooks in the first place, so those sweatshirts came with taffeta cuffs, while an oversize herringbone cape had a prodigious drape.</p><p>Rose also tapped into the inevitable Poiret revival that will accompany this spring¿s Costume Institute exhibition. There was a touch of the twenties in elongated tanks and tees paired with drop-waist full skirts, as well as in unstructured chemises in polka-dot gauze and panne velvet. The French master¿s signature bright colors were here, too. Rose said that she borrowed the marigolds, crimsons, and rococo blues from old, colorized black-and-white movies. Whatever the reference, they were a welcome jolt after last fall¿s more muted palette.</p></div>"
112,fall,2007,f2007,loewe,"Autumn is the time to turn up the heat, and José Enrique Oña Selfa didn¿t disappoint on that score. Gone were the A-line shifts, lush floral prints, and mod silvers of spring, and in their place were tough-chic black motorcycle leathers, fur coats, and chubbies, and a turquoise suede skirtsuit as supple as it was bright. All that fit in with the vampy, slightly eighties vibe of the season, as did a black dress with gold sequin embroidery, the Lurex touches on a long tank and a crisscross bodice dress, and the matching heavy-metal eye makeup.</p><p>So what exactly is the identity of this historic Spanish leather-goods brand? Beyond the exotic-skin bags buffed to a high shine, it¿s hard to tell. Should LVMH ever want it to rival the French luxury houses in its stable—or simply make it a competitor in the U.S., which was not well represented at the show—Oña Selfa will have to learn to take a lead on trends rather than simply follow them.</p></div>"
113,fall,2007,f2007,louis-vuitton,"Behind the scenes, Marc Jacobs—now in his tenth year at Louis Vuitton—had a knowing tag for the season: He called it ""Girl with a Monogram Handbag."" So there it was, as a mathematical equation: Scarlett Johansson (she of <em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> and the Louis Vuitton ad campaign, sitting front row) + Vermeer (research trip to Holland) = Fall 2007 collection. And yet, not quite. At the end of the show, which also featured a plethora of references to Jacobs' previous LV outings, all he would declare was, ""Clothes, and more clothes!"" and then, more reluctantly, ""A Vermeer palette. Romantic, graphic, painterly, but kind of strong.""</p><p>In fact, there's no urgent need to Google ""Dutch Masters"" to get a fix on the fact that this Fall collection was actually a mustering of sportswear pieces as a foil for a huge range of Vuitton accessories—everything from big, floppy Flemish berets to tinted patent and shearling bags, brushed-gilt plate-metal buckled belts and shiny little shoe-boots. First off, the clothes were simply a matter of high-necked dark green, gray, and fluffy orange sweaters, color-blocked against copper, bronze, blue, and red lamé skirts. Then came leather circle skirts with loose-backed jackets falling in a curve at the back, and a great oversize blue-gray sweater over slim pants.</p><p>That section moved into black and navy tailoring, the best examples being neat pencil skirts with menswear pocket flaps, and eventually into grown-up chic suits (including a couple with pieces of densely tufted tulle and crochet whacked on the shoulder to puff things up) and black dresses. For evening, it was a matter of <em>dégradé</em> printed dresses, some sprouting ostrich feathers under the hem. In other words, the show felt a bit all over the place. But never mind: A lot of the women in the audience declared that, once the elements are merchandised for stores, they'll be going shopping.</p></div>"
114,fall,2007,f2007,luca-luca,"It's no secret that Luca Orlandi likes to get as much glitz as possible into his front row. Sitting runwayside this season were Petra Nemcova, J.C. Chasez, Amber Tamblyn, Carmen Electra, and <em>The Hills</em>' Lauren Conrad and Audrina Partridge. Not a bad turnout for an arctic post-Super Bowl Monday afternoon.</p><p>What's more, Orlandi decided to take that glitz to the runway in a collection so chock-full of metallics that any Luca lover who doesn't like to sparkle will have to find her winter wardrobe elsewhere. The designer worked the idea again and again in all manner of sequins, Lurex, and iridescent silk. Though he mostly played it earthbound, Orlandi occasionally skewed futuristic, as in a liquid silver hooded bodysuit layered under a skirtsuit. The Luca Luca lady is hardly a wallflower, but at times it was a bit of an overload even for her.</p><p>Reworked fur—an early Fall trend—also made repeat appearances, tiered with chiffon into a skirt, or trimming a sequined dress in stripes. While it may seem luxurious in theory to use fur in such unusual ways, in practice it can be tricky. A chic chocolate sheared-mink-and-crocodile coat showed that restraint might just be the key to making it work. Another relatively plain coat also stood out, this one a winter-white trench with a collar lightly embellished with clear crystal chunks. It proved that you don't always need to shine so brightly to grab someone's attention.</p></div>"
115,fall,2007,f2007,luella,"Horses, coming-out parties, Sgt. Pepper military gear—Luella's girls have fallen head over heels for all things proper and British this season. Angela Lindvall opened the designer's upbeat Fall show in a red hunting coat with a velvet collar and a mink jockey cap. Diana Dondoe played the deb in an ocher dress with a cinched waist (though her riding boots, customized by an artist named Noki, had what Bartley described as a ""very London street vibe""). Freja Beha Erichsen's short boxy jacket, meanwhile, was paired with a white bow shirt and polka-dot mini.</p><p>There was a deliberate ""frumpy"" element to all this, but Luella being Luella, she successfully sent up the concept with playful looks like a black coat with a patent bow and mink pom-pom buttons. And when Julia Stegner took to the runway in a menswear plaid coat, button-down, and tight pink jeans, the outfit could have come out of the model's own cool-girl closet.</p></div>"
116,fall,2007,f2007,luisa-beccaria,"It was a family affair at Luisa Beccaria. Her youngest daughter, Luna, scooted down the runway in a golden brocade shift. And her oldest girl, Lucilla, came out with her for her bow. In fact, it is with Lucilla's input that Beccaria has started moving the always-feminine, occasionally frothy collection in a younger direction, refining her understanding of what the party set she caters to really wants to wear now.</p><p>This season, the Beccaria look spanned black silk velvets punctuated with ivory frills; forties frocks with puffed shoulders, bow fronts, and flippy hems in an arabesque-print silk or silvered lace; sixties bracelet-sleeved A-line coats; and, of course, a fair amount of fuchsia pink. In fuchsia, a short strapless satin dress worked better than a ruched cocktail number in silk velvet. A rosebud-print trench and matching pants added up to a misstep, too, but you could imagine Beccaria pulling off the same silhouette in a solid. One of the best looks of the show was a tailored, ankle-grazing evening trench. Among the more ethereal chiffon evening confections, it stood out for its sophistication.</p></div>"
117,fall,2007,f2007,maison-martin-margiela,"The twin forces who have made fashion turn to ponder the pushed-out, built-up shoulder are Martin Margiela and Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga. What they did last season is still controversial—and advanced—though many others are now clicking into the idea, gradually working toward a forties film noir silhouette. So now he's in the lead, Martin Margiela is canny to keep at it. The Fall collection he showed today might have been subtitled ""Shoulders II."" This time, the line was way, way out there—50 centimeters, to be precise—and aided, in some cases, by rods on which to hang the vast inverted triangle of the upper body.</p><p>This sharp shape was a starting point for a total look. Essentially, it tapered downward to high-waisted narrow skirts or black leg casings that were a strange amalgam of ski pants and long-line girdle. Mad as this sounds, there was a dramatic, graphic elegance in the way Margiela worked the theme through black and white, with contrasting shots of fluorescent pink and lime. The big shoulders didn't always literally make a rod for a woman's back. He moved from squared-off capes through conceptual boleros constructed of strands of looped wool or giant tubes of tulle-covered padding. But then came the luxe part, sans superstructure. There were rabbit-fur jackets with huge cowls, and a couple of glam backless shaggy goat halters that gave a clever twist to the season's ubiquitous chubbies.</p><p>Yes, this is avant-garde fashion pushed to its most extreme limits, and many women will be scared to death by it. On the other hand, if the reaction to Margiela's last collection is anything to go by, editors will rush to shoot it, and other designers will quietly absorb its signals as a way to move forward.</p></div>"
118,fall,2007,f2007,malo,"For Spring, Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi had done a futuristic take on Marimekko; for Fall, it was a futuristic take on Franz Kline. Abstract expressionism: That explains the splashy prints. And the cool austerity. Tailored menswear for women was the focus of the first half of the show. Fur was also abundant; one that looked like astrakhan had hirsute beaver sleeves. But what about the knitwear, you ask? After all, this is Malo, home of luxurious Italian cashmeres. Knits were represented by untraditional ""Rasta"" pieces, like the opening look, covered with twists of yarn that looked almost like dreadlocks. There was a mohair mini that looked like it might purr.</p><p>Some of Aquilano and Rimondi's artsy-craftsy techniques worked better than others. A feathered and beaded coat was over-the-top fabulous. The pieces with outsize jingle-jangle plastic beads, not so much. In the audience were Lenny Kravitz, a Romanoff princess, and Italy's answer to the Traina sisters, Matilde and Beatrice Borromeo. How these high-profile Malo customers will react to some of Aquilano and Rimondi's experiments is TBD, but the collection was well-edited, and overall it felt like the designers were pushing the brand forward.</p></div>"
119,fall,2007,f2007,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs commandeered Claridge's, flew in a planeload of pretty friends, and changed the air in London the minute his gang started tripping into the Marc by Marc Jacobs show. Was it a glorious social spectacle? Of course. For London to get a look at Sofia Coppola, Zoe Cassavetes, Selma Blair, Rufus Wainwright, Lisa Marie, and Lucie de la Falaise in the flesh was a rare treat indeed. This sort of thing does not happen in the raw basements of London fashion week.</p><p>But was it a life-changing show? Of course not. ""Oh, I always think it's silly to talk about themes and inspirations,"" said Jacobs with engaging frankness. ""The collection's just always about this youthful, angelic, idyllic army. It's comprised of a lot of things—big plaids, layered woolliness, gangly stockings—but really, it's all about how people will break it down and wear it in their own way.""</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>In other words, it was supercute and stuffed with lovely accessories from the tip of a furry bonnet to the toe of the stack-heeled ""skating boots."" Skating was (loosely) the theme that ran through the cozy pileup of blanket-check coats, flimsy dresses pulled over stripy sweaters, knitted salopettes, and wide gray tweed pants. For something so layered, though, it never seemed heavy, perhaps because of the short proportions and the minute, swingy pleated skirts that flipped under Empire coats. As only in a Marc by Marc Jacobs show, all this managed to look both girlishly spontaneous and thought-out down to the last little detail—the details being thick gray rib tights; scarves with deep pockets in each end; platform hiking boots; a great selection of berets, beanies, pom-pom fur riding hats; and a covetable squished, peaked trapper's hat.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""etbzvp""></div></div><p>And why was all this getting shown in London? As a one-off in celebration of the Marc Jacobs store that opened this week on Mount Street in the heart of Mayfair. It finished off London fashion week with a bang—and a bash. At the after-party at the Connaught, weary showgoers gratefully got to eat, drink, and be merry for the first time in days.</p></div>"
120,fall,2007,f2007,marc-jacobs,"When the red velvet curtain finally opened, Marc Jacobs' 56 models were arrayed tableau vivant-style in front of an enormous set of French doors—the kind you might see in a Paris salon. What you noticed first were the hats. Multicolored, with knit crowns, and short or wide brims, they made the gangly teenage girls onstage hold themselves like proper ladies. Yes, fashion's favorite change agent was at it again.</p><p>Last season's billowy layers were nowhere in sight. The collection began with a long coat, ribbed sweater, and trousers with loose stirrups that gave them a clean, sharp line. Moving on, Jacobs showed printed satin and matte jersey shirtdresses to the mid-calf, and belted alpaca tunics over slim cropped pants and knee-length skirts. There were jumpsuits straight out of the seventies. ""I wanted something narrower,"" said the designer, describing the show's new silhouette. Duchesse satin minidresses were cut trim and A-line with a fringe of pleats at the hem, or they came draped, wrapped, and sashed from the shoulders.</p><p>This was American sportswear, but with a European sense of impeccability. Some might call it ""grown-up."" Jacobs, explaining that the collection is a reflection of what's going on with him personally, called it restraint. (Though the term can hardly be used to describe the show's stacks of plastic bangles and Bakelite-heavy handbags.) One look at the designer and you're reminded that he's been spending time at the gym—those were pecs beneath his crisp blue shirt. The experiments with volume that he's been focused on in the last several collections have now gone the way of his extra weight. It might take a season for designers who've followed his lead before to catch on. But less, when it looks this chic, really is more.</p></div>"
121,fall,2007,f2007,marchesa,"Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig took some critical hits for unfinished hems and sloppy seams at their debut runway show last season. But from the looks of their Fall collection, shown tableau-style at Diane von Furstenberg¿s old West 12th Street digs, they learned from the experience.</p><p>Perhaps the androgynous Marlene Dietrich-meets-the-Duchess-of-Windsor theme simply suited them better than Spring¿s hyper-romantic flowers. Or maybe their recent red-carpet coups—Sienna Miller and J. Lo at the Golden Globes; Anne Hathaway at the SAG Awards—have boosted their confidence.</p><p>In any case, there was newfound polish to the satin chiffon dresses with embroidered waists that have become their calling card. The girls love a rhinestone, and they hand-sewed ropes of them to a violet velvet strapless chemise for a trompe l¿oeil necklace effect. And there was more ambition, too, in the black-and-white pieces that riffed sexily on a man¿s tuxedo—although a simpler bib-front frock was more successful than a party dress with a tricky bodice made from what looked like the collars of a jacket and a shirt. And if the sweeping ball gown in silk tulle with <em>dégradé</em> feather bodice is too grand for today¿s starlets, they¿ll be angling for first dibs on the ostrich-plume cocktail number with a duchesse satin belt.</p></div>"
122,fall,2007,f2007,marios-schwab,"Marios Schwab has the right instincts about moving away from the neon-bright, body-conscious, early nineties vibe with which he and Christopher Kane ignited new interest in London last year. The challenge lies in gauging the speed at which to do it, and in successfully developing some fresh angles that feel true and sincere—all while offering something sensible to sell in the bargain.</p><p>He opened his collection with a hexagonally pieced nip-waist jacket with a curve in the back that stood away from the body like a geodesic dome. Cutting hexagons and mathematically fitting them around the human form is a pastime Schwab devised last summer, and now he¿s applying it to puffers. Cut into hourglass shapes and skating dresses, these carried a distinct air of Gaultier Junior, circa 1989. They were also the designer's personal response to the futuristic-sporty agenda that¿s been in the air since last fall.</p><p>Schwab is too methodical about weaving in new strands of thought to leave it at that. He¿s also working on a fresh approach to dresses. He should. The tight body-line ones, even with new iridescent metal plates worked into the bodice, are beginning to be yesterday¿s news. More interesting were the soft asymmetries he wrapped into sport-fleece tops and scarf-lashed necklines (a reference to Romeo Gigli, perhaps?). Some of this read as a work in progress, but with the intense Schwab, it¿s guaranteed he¿ll have developed it into more sophisticated form next season.</p></div>"
123,fall,2007,f2007,marni,"Legion are the women who want to be in the Marni-girl gang these days. On the runway, designer Consuelo Castiglioni's knack for layering up sporty-techno bits and pieces with shiny black PVC and odd shots of bright color and print is pushing this label out in front as one of the most refreshing forces in fashion. Last summer, she simply put sport-leggings under her favorite tunics, and the world ran after her. Now that she's sneaking elements of technical outdoorsy clothing into her wardrobe, the same thing will happen again. One glance at Marni's genius nylon platform-soled ski boots will set off a fan avalanche, guaranteed.</p><p>It's partly the designer's talent for striding ahead without breaking continuity that does it. Her Marni girl has often been typecast as an eclectic, original spirit, but Castiglioni's no woolly thinker: She follows her ideas through from one season to the next, and people love her for it. Thus, she's playing with the same sort of shapes, like plain loose tunics and gray parallel pants, but is now mixing them up with nylon T-shirts, neoprene vests, PVC skirts, and down linings, then cinching it all in with a hefty webbing belt. If this sounds a bit of a mess, it's not—the really clever part is that the cheerfully arty charm of Marni carries it all along. This season it's there in the bright, multicolored marbled prints; the color blocking of magenta, royal blue, and green; the shaggy beaver and goat-hair coats. In the end, Marni achieves a unique, offbeat glamour along with a life-enhancing playfulness that is irresistible.</p></div>"
124,fall,2007,f2007,martin-grant,"The pleasures of a Martin Grant show are found in the smallest of details: the sculptural fan-pleated bodice of a strapless dress, the perfectly spherical clear buttons descending the front of a collarless, bubble-hem coat, the way one strap of a cocktail number is designed to slip provocatively off the shoulder, while the other remains demurely in place. These touches and more were on display on Grant's runway today—evidence that, after a brief, ill-advised dip into the sportif side of fashion, the designer has returned to his dressmaking roots and the exacting tailoring for which he's known.</p><p>Working in a palette of black, white, gray, and purple, Grant captured the season's voluminous but structured silhouette, without seeming trendy. The show started off with an A-line, hooded bouclé coat, and there were sway-back jackets, egg-shaped coats, and wide-leg pants for day. For evening, he focused on tulip and bubble dresses that often came with a second cutaway cocooning skirt. The highlights included a pair of satiny coat-dresses, one with a pouf at the upper back, the other flaring out from the shoulders like a cape. Best of all, though, was the finale—a silver lamé siren gown that, in contrast to the other rounded shapes, skimmed the body like a breeze.</p><p>Just one quibble: The pacing of the show was far too stately for the seen-it-all, end-of-fashion-week crowd.</p></div>"
125,fall,2007,f2007,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson is a dyed-in-the-wool fashion nomad, plucking inspiration from all around the globe to weave into his colorful wares. This season, he claimed to have found his spark on his first visit to Tokyo—a whirlwind 48-hour press trip he took for his bosses at Emilio Pucci. After last spring's much-criticized Day-Glo Ibizan romp, Williamson was aiming for polish and refinement, but his habitual layering of color, texture, and statement-making silhouettes didn't leave much room for either goal. There were metallic brocades, icy jacquards, and heavy, jewel-toned satins, all crusted with chunks of crystal. A vintage streak showed up in the form of patchworked furs, a purple Mondrian-print coat, and palazzo pants topped with patterned Lurex turtlenecks.</p><p>The collection may have been intended to capture the frenetic energy of a teeming neon metropolis where fashion statements are a national pastime, but on the runway the effect was overwhelming. Amid the visual overload, though, were looks of the sort that Williamson does best, like a slim printed gown in a swirling print on Coco Rocha or a Deco beaded tunic. It might be here that the designer can find what he's been looking for.</p></div>"
126,fall,2007,f2007,maurizio-pecoraro,"Maurizio Pecoraro makes it his business to keep an eye on the way the fashion winds are blowing. Mixed in among his twist-front dresses, full trousers, and a check suit were bugle-beaded shells and matching skirts, slouchy varsity cardigans, sack coats, and other twenties references that started appearing in New York two weeks ago.</p><p>Short-sleeve jackets came with deep fur cuffs, necklines were trimmed with gem-studded chiffon, and waists were loosely cinched with velvet bows. One short fur jacket looked like it had been dipped in liquid gold. Pecoraro steered the heavily ornamented collection away from becoming a predictable Poiret revival, though, by keeping the silhouettes fresh. For instance, a satin tunic dress topped by a trompe l'oeil velvet cardigan (they were in fact attached) was abbreviated at the upper thigh. But in the end, the models' too-literal marcel waves and red lips gave the pretty clothes a vintage feel, when what they needed was a modern edge.</p></div>"
127,fall,2007,f2007,max-azria,"¿Big girl, you are beautiful!¿ sang the Brit pop flavor of the moment Mika on the boppy tune that opened the show—as if to hammer home the point that the three-season-old MaxAzria line is more grown-up than its sibling, BCBG Max Azria.</p><p>What followed was heavy on pleating—here as elsewhere this week, sometimes seeming to do little but create bulk. Still, the pleats were well applied in a few cases, as in a pretty, belted black-and-green chiffon dress worn by Julia Dunstall. Roomy knit coats and cashmere sweater dresses were cozy and autumnal, while a muskrat tank-shaped vest looked quite sophisticated.</p><p>Max and Lubov Azria have a faithful following, and their show attracted a brace of social girls to the front row: Camilla Belle, Tinsley Mortimer, Leigh Lezark, Byrdie Bell, and Olivia Palermo among them. These are young women with lots of photo opportunities. What will they be wearing to next fall¿s movie premieres? Maybe a black sequined lace coat over a navy halter dress with beading detail. And for dinner with an up-and-coming Mexican director? A metallic jacquard shift with cream satin pleated sleeves would fill that role quite nicely.</p></div>"
128,fall,2007,f2007,max-mara,"The jumpsuit is a puzzling trend. It has the one-stop-shopping appeal of a dress, yes, but none of the ease. There's no simple way to get one on, and once you have, chances are you'll look like a paratrooper crossed with a car mechanic. In other words, approach with caution—a warning that went unheeded at MaxMara, where the boilersuits, coveralls, and ski suits came in all manner of styles: flannels and satins, long-sleeved and tank, full through the leg or tapered. Another strange recurrence were the show's dreadlock knits—thick dangling fringes edging the sleeves of jackets and sweaters, and in some cases multiplying across the back.</p><p>Both concepts served only to distract from the great-looking coats that MaxMara is known for. This season the best were the ankle-grazing belted shearlings and the equally long parkas in camo green with safety-orange lining. There was no ignoring the army jackets, however, with their epaulets in electric bright blue and acid yellow; or the shocking-orange tartan pants (cut nice and slim) that were paired with a snug cropped bomber. Chic practicality has long been the essence of this brand, but, all in all there just wasn't enough of it here.</p></div>"
129,fall,2007,f2007,michael-kors-collection,"<em>Sportswear</em> has become one of Fall's buzzwords, and Michael Kors was not only in his element but in top crowd-pleasing form. Working in a palette of soft, flattering (read: salable) neutrals, with shots of safety orange and caution yellow, he laid the cashmere on thick. A knit dress shaded from cream to chestnut. An oversize face-framing cowl-neck pullover peaked out from beneath a Donegal tweed swing coat. And other sweaters, with plunging V-necks and deep keyholes, made an erogenous zone of the back.</p><p>The only thing he loves more than four-ply, of course, is fur. Here, Kors pulled out all the stops. It trimmed trenches and anoraks, even a stand-away-collar sheath. And—talk about luxe—he used truffle broadtail for a swing dress and coffee mink for a shift. Should the absolutely mammoth fox chubby in royal blue have suffocated the tiny model who wore it, any number of his front-row fans would've swooped in to pick it up—no second thought for the girl.</p><p>For evening, there was this season's requisite fringe dress and an even shorter cocktail number in an oversize gold-and-brown sequin check, a riff on the collection's glen plaid suiting. His signature long jersey dresses, meanwhile, were embroidered with clear crystals. Sexy, but they didn't have the unleashed exuberance of his day looks.</p></div>"
130,fall,2007,f2007,michon-schur,"This was a quiet collection, but a rather lovely one. Giving away the fact that she hails from the sunnier shores of L.A ., Stephanie Schur incorporated some unusually light elements for Fall: breezy silk-twill dresses, chiffon tops, and gauzy head wraps that clearly weren't designed to weather the winter winds of New York. Actually, Schur had East Asia in mind: Japanese art, to be exact.</p><p>For us Northeasterners, thankfully, these delicate bits were deftly mixed with heavier pieces. Exhibit A: a dress that had a rose skirt floating beneath a fitted black-wool bodice. A pink silk top—simple save for the enormous crystals cascading from the shoulders—was tucked into a voluminous black skirt with that subtle sheen we've seen all over this week. Fuchsia and black moirés as well as clean, Japanese prints, added texture to a sweetly winning collection.</p></div>"
131,fall,2007,f2007,missoni,"In a season when the forties and the seventies are a rising influence, Missoni incorporated them both. It's hardly a novelty to tie the decades together, though, because ""the forties"" were the rediscovery of the early seventies—which just so happens to be the time when the Missonis were first knitting together their family business. The trouble is, so many are stomping their platforms on this well-trodden era this season that it's shown there's a fine line—no, a chasm—between doing it badly and making it seem like not such a lame idea after all.</p><p>Angela Missoni came out on the right side of the line, even if she did use the familiar devices of Rita Hayworth's hair, Marlene Dietrich's tip-tilted hat, and the inevitable Bowie sound track. But what's the distinction between Missoni's cape-sleeved printed dresses, big-shouldered furs, balloon sleeves, tailored flares, Deco jerseys and everyone else's? It's largely a deft wielding of the hard-to-handle dusty seventies palette. Exact choices of maroon, brown, beige, mustard, dusty pink, and petrol blue marked Missoni best-in-class in Milan. Even irregularly pieced triangular Deco patchworks (fully murdered in several collections elsewhere) turned into a double-knit patchwork dress and a shorter shell version that actually looked likable—both were helped immeasurably by sexy gathers shaping the bustline. When Missoni keeps the confidence of her feminine instincts like that, things go well. What she might learn is not to be panicked by conflicting trend news. The demerit in this show was the unstoppable short circle skirt that kept popping up, which seemed not just out of character with the collection, but like a panic reaction to the Azzedine Alaïa trend that's currently doing the rounds.</p></div>"
132,fall,2007,f2007,miu-miu,"This was an intentionally conceptual show, but it started simply enough: The first look out was a camel suit with a slightly nipped waist and rounded hips over a pleated knee-length skirt—its girth perhaps a little exaggerated—worn with knee socks and spectator pumps.</p><p>From there, however, the molded shapes turned more pronounced, almost old-ladyish, in fact…. And then came the provocatively sheer, flesh-tone metallic twinsets and skirts…followed by rubbery leather coats in lipstick pinks and reds.</p><p>Miuccia Prada returned her attention to the natural/synthetic dichotomy that informed her Prada show (and many other designers' this season), with the accent falling heavily this time on the man-made. In reality, those A-line coats were 100 percent real leather, but lined with neoprene to look spongy and fake.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""7r948x""></div></div><p>What was her point? ""It's a vision of what's happening in the world right now with women,"" she said after the show. ""On videos and TV all of the women look fake. I wanted to show this plasticized vision, but filtered through classic pieces and sticking to tradition.""</p><p>This translated to jackets and pants cut from a Lurex-shot quilted fabric that looked like nothing so much as your old granny's polyester housecoat (and appeared just as flammable). Cardigans and V-necks were tucked into the top of nude pantyhose, the waistbands of which were exposed above low-slung skirts. Strapless dresses came with deflated, folded-over bra cups, as if to suggest they would only fit correctly if filled with pneumatic silicone breasts.</p><p>Despite all the (matron-meets-) porn-star allusions, this wasn't a sexy collection. And it won't necessarily be easy to wear, either. But in her characteristically thoughtful style, Prada has given everyone plenty to ponder on their long plane ride home.</p></div>"
133,fall,2007,f2007,monique-lhuillier,"""Industrial"" and ""modern"" are hardly the buzzwords you expect to hear from a designer whose romantic gowns regularly survive the red-carpet gauntlet, a process that tends to discourage forward-thinking looks. Still, this season, Monique Lhuillier had architecture on the brain, the result, she said, of seeing the Disney Concert Hall on a daily basis. (Frank Gehry's masterpiece neighbors her Los Angeles office.)</p><p>The designer didn't really follow through on her intentions, though. Little in the collection approached the stark quality of the brushed-steel, Gehry-esque curl hung above the runway and, in fact, Lhuillier's choice of fabrics like gold lamés and brocades played it quite rich. Still, the motif was echoed here and there in flat gold hardware and circular seaming, edged prettily in chiffon, on both plain wool coats and metallic pencil skirts. Elsewhere, boxy coats with bracelet-length sleeves gave a futuristic-by-way-of-the-sixties feel.</p><p>Lhuillier says that she wants to be known as more than a red-carpet designer, but as a series of slim gowns with jeweled belts paraded past, it was difficult to think of anything else. The sole exception to the celebrity-stylist-friendly fare was a convoluted animal-print ball gown, layered with tulle and then embroidered. A better option? A strapless number in a lovely emerald satin—chic and Joan Rivers-proof.</p></div>"
134,fall,2007,f2007,moschino,"The massive gold peace sign at the back of the runway could've meant Moschino's audience was in for more of the military looks seen elsewhere this week, but that couldn't have been further from the case. Instead, designer Rosella Jardini focused on the innocence of the sixties, as exemplified by the bubble silhouettes that are still popping up all over Milan. The collection started all sweetness and light with a swingy brocade coat-dress. A gold laser-cut leather pinafore, a short navy taffeta shift with bunches of rosettes at the back, and a lamp-shade coat in red satin also kept the look young, as did the sporty black fabric used for such pieces as a one-shoulder dress.</p><p>The collection was pretty enough, in other words, but somewhat tepid by house standards. Where was the signature wackiness? The only hint of the late Franco Moschino's madcap wit was in a couple of slogan T-shirts (in the style of Frankie Goes to Hollywood or House of Holland, depending on your generation) that read ""MOSCHINO SAYS LOVE."" A few more surprising gestures like that would've made the show more interesting.</p></div>"
135,fall,2007,f2007,naeem-khan,"DJ Donna D'Cruz set a party mood…and Naeem Khan has had reason to celebrate lately. After all, this is the designer who created the slithery metallic dresses worn in the finale of <em>Dreamgirls</em>. And at today's show, he might have had the Oscars in mind (hint, hint, Beyoncé) when he sent out a series of sheaths and gowns covered in jewel-tone paillettes.</p><p>If somewhat repetitive, the effect was still dazzling. Another series of striking pieces, including a festive evening jacket, was decked out with hand-cut Venetian-glass mirrors. A series of organzas, meanwhile, were appliquéd with abstract patterns of patent leather, inspired by Mogul palaces in Khan's native India.</p><p>He also used embellishments of pleated and steam-crushed organza ribbons. ""They are fabulous—artsy and crafty, but modern,"" feels Khan. The Halston alum balanced out the glitz factor a bit with a pair of pieces that expressed a more subtle elegance: a flowing scarf gown in ombré shades of topaz and a one-shouldered dress adorned with a simple feather corsage.</p></div>"
136,fall,2007,f2007,narciso-rodriguez,"""Keep it light,"" Narciso Rodriguez said backstage. ""Life is heavy enough."" Apparently, last season's breakthroughs with surface decoration—the plastics, the metal appliqués, the embroideries—had left him wanting more of less. And even by his stringent standards, this was one pared-down—and, perhaps as an inevitable consequence, rather muted—collection.</p><p>Blowing up and otherwise manipulating his own digital photographs, he created subtle prints and embroideries that added depth to cutaway silk dresses. (As low-key as the prints were, they proved too overpowering for signature curved-seam suits.) Other cleanly sophisticated treatments included beading in concentric squares that decorated the front of a collarless coat, and silk cord that wrapped around the torso and asymmetrically over one shoulder of long dresses.</p><p>One of the show's few shots of color—in a smooth stream of black, white, cream, and gray—came in the form of a gorgeous emerald silk evening anorak. You could see that one out on the town…whereas a blue-and-black jacket in a similar shape but cut in a stiffer wool had too much of the football field about it. As he proved again with an elegant long black coat with sweeping new proportions, this minimalist is at his best when he's thinking urban (and when he's not letting the understatement undermine the drama).</p></div>"
137,fall,2007,f2007,nathan-jenden,"Perhaps with a little joke at his own expense, Nathan Jenden named his collection ¿Gatecrasher¿—an apt title for a New Yorker who¿s just shown up at the young-designer party in London. Or perhaps it was less a quip than a description. His girls, wearing puffy taffeta gowns and strapless cocktail dresses, arrived on the scene throwing attitude in teased-up quiffs, metal-grill veils, and brothel creepers. ¿I¿m English,¿ said the British-born expat designer. ¿London is less sleek. It has a harder edge than New York.¿</p><p>In his day job, Jenden is Diane von Furstenburg¿s chief aide-de-camp, and generously, she flew in to support her protégé¿s first London show. In a sign of independence, there wasn't a wrap dress in sight, but the fabrics, like ¿metallic silk linen,¿ ¿optic moiré,¿ and ¿brushed-silk jacquard,¿ had an unmistakable New York polish about them. Styling apart, the substance was in Jenden's puffy-shouldered dresses, a little matte black frock sliced across the shoulders and fitted saucily around the backside, and a suit in sparkly black tweed.</p><p>In the end, then, this didn¿t read like a renegade outburst, but as a young designer¿s bid to get a viewing of his collection on a less crowded platform. Which is quite ironic, when you think about it.</p></div>"
138,fall,2007,f2007,naum,"Working in a limited palette, mostly austere black with splashes of bold red, Julia Jentzsch and Waleed Khairzada set their minds on volume and proportion. ¿We wanted to reimagine the geometry and movement of the clothes on the body,¿ Khairzada said, after the show at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in Hell¿s Kitchen.</p><p>The recent Ecco Domani winners achieved said goal through the use of high-tech materials (fabric technology is a near obsession with them) and clever, precise tailoring. In the volume department: a balloon-like parka, ¿sphere¿ jackets and tops that bubbled away from the body, wide-legged pants, and puffed sleeves. Plays on proportion included oversize blazers that brought to mind eighties power suiting and elongated silhouettes in the form of a slim, high-waisted skirt suit and breezy silk column dresses.</p><p>A smart business executive could fill her closet with Naum and never worry about looking inappropriate. But a cooler creative type, who¿s never suffered under fluorescent lights in her life, would be a happy Naum customer, too.</p></div>"
139,fall,2007,f2007,neil-barrett,"This collection marked Neil Barrett's second time showing womenswear on the runway—though like his fellow cult-inspiring men's designers, he has in fact been dressing the fairer sex for much longer simply by cutting his coolly tailored clothes into smaller sizes. This season, however, he decided not to translate his considerable talent for menswear quite so literally. In short, he wanted to give the ladies something of their own.</p><p>As admirable a sentiment as that might be, in practice it didn't really work out. In a severe palette of black, gray, and white, Barrett explored the idea of sculpted tailoring that stood away from the body, the result of hearing complaints from girlfriends about the limitations of stricter cuts. That meant boxy jackets with bracelet sleeves, pleated wide trousers, and cocoon coats, which, though executed well, seemed more likely to appeal to an older customer than the one Barrett targets. The result was that his fans were left wanting more. ""Now <em>that's</em> what I like from him,"" whispered a young but influential stylist as a little motorcycle jacket in a chic dark-gray leather and slim pants finally passed by.</p></div>"
140,fall,2007,f2007,nicole-miller,"This industry veteran has, over the last few seasons, embarked on a fashion expedition of sorts through a world of ancient civilizations. After last spring¿s Mayan exploration, Miller ventured south to Peru for fall. But while she did accessorize with the traditional flat-brimmed hats—Peruvians are mad for hats—the folky theme was balanced by a refined sense of modernity and city chic.</p><p>Plenty of the patterns and prints she's come to be so closely associated with appeared, but the most interesting pieces were as plain as could be. Bubble-sleeved pea coat; slim, boyish trousers; and pinafore dresses worn over banker-striped shirts made a strong counterpoint to the graphic jacquards and blanket prints.</p><p>Swarmed by well-wishers backstage (including Ann Dexter-Jones, Sarah Wynter, and Cyndi Lauper), Miller joked about the fact that her label recently celebrated its quarter-century mark. ""It's my birthday, not my anniversary!"" she kidded the crowd. That's a long time for a label to hold strong, but by all accounts, Miller is as involved as ever in the day-to-day running of the business, and forging solidly ahead.</p></div>"
141,fall,2007,f2007,nina-ricci,"Olivier Theyskens said he wanted “to introduce a new wave of cool—something urban and gray-ish, but nonchalant, fragile, and superlight” at Nina Ricci. Since he’s only just exited the now-defunct Rochas, the collection he showed, though suffused with his signature poetics, felt more transitional than definitive. Like several other designers of his age, Theyskens is accurately intuiting the fact that fashion needs to address a younger, more casual level of dressing, but at the same time, pressure is on him to stay within the fuzzy parameters of the not-so-defined genre of Ricci femininity.</p><p>So to begin with, Theyskens focused on teardrop-shaped down-filled blousons, twisted sweater dresses, and diagonally zipped biker jackets that fell open in soft, petal-like folds. If there was a discernible Nina Ricci reference, it was in the spiraling cuts reminiscent of the crystal flacons of the classic Ricci L’Air du Temps perfume bottle. What with the palette of pearl gray, slate, and charcoal, and the introduction of denim, the collection fell somewhere in the range of Rick Owens, the L.A. designer whose clothes have a link to Belgian streetwise aesthetics.</p><p>That, of course, is no coincidence: Theyskens is himself a Belgian designer who, before his tenure at Rochas, made an impact, at the age of 21, with strong, dark collections that electrified fashion in the late nineties. His mood now is far more ethereal—the downy feathers floating from the girls’ hair established that quite beautifully. Nevertheless, two soft but fiercely cut pantsuits served as a reminder of the tailoring talent that remained latent while he concentrated on femininity at Rochas. Excellent as those were, they added to the tension that hovered over the collection. Theyskens laid on an irresistible finale of trail-y, ragged-edged white and chartreuse fantasy gowns, but still, the question about where he intends to take Ricci was left in the air.</p></div>"
142,fall,2007,f2007,noir,"After three seasons showing in London, the meaning behind Peter Ingwersen¿s ¿Noir¿ has finally become clear. The name has nothing to do with the color black, necessarily, but there¿s always something perverse running through this show, and unfortunately, it's beginning to hold it back.</p><p>Ingwersen, a Danish eco-activist who is developing a sustainable cotton farm in Uganda, seems overanxious to prove that humanitarian fashion can be sexy. Often, it crops up in the form of black leather among the otherwise sharp jackets and luxuriously crisp mannish cotton shirts that are Noir's strongest established staples. Until now, it hasn't been too difficult to avert one's eyes from the odd pair of leather trousers, but this season, Ingwersen's heavy-handed Weimar Berlin theme almost scuppered the show.</p><p>It was conveyed with lashings of the usual <em>Cabaret</em> cliché—butch ties, silk-and-lace lingerie, even a fetishy leather policeman cape. As for the flashy crystal-diamanté bras and buttons, and Baron von Richthofen jodphurs: No. They were laid on so insistently that the audience¿s goodwill could be felt draining from the room at every exit. And that¿s a major pity, because beneath it all, the clean, nicely tailored core of Noir isn¿t a dark and pervy proposition. The world is ready to equate eco-soundness with cool, and Ingwersen shouldn¿t be afraid to show his clothes without the distracting trappings of a heavy, and not very original, theme.</p></div>"
143,fall,2007,f2007,oscar-de-la-renta,"It could've been a movie, so picture-perfect was Oscar de la Renta's take on the good life. From beginning to end, and day to night, the collection sparkled. A houndstooth sheath glinted with crystal embroidery; a cardigan (of which there were many covetable varieties) came trimmed with chains and stones; and tweed coats were laminated so that they resembled crinkly patent leather.</p><p>On top of that, the fur was fairly flying, from après-ski vests—little rings of ermine or sable circling the shoulders of models in evening dresses—to weightless chinchillas for warding off the wind as it whips down the avenues. Even the designer's sweaters were lined and edged in the stuff. But when it comes to luxe factor, the astrakhan shot through with gold and finished off with face-framing wolverine was the ne plus ultra.</p><p>Come evening, the designer had something for everyone to covet: for the minimalists, a silk velvet dress with swayback in deepest navy; for would-be princesses, the fairy tale of a gown in embroidered anthracite tulle with matching chinchilla bolero that closed the show. Complaints? He could've switched up some of the sequin cocktail dresses for a few more suits. Otherwise, this was another Oscar crowd-pleaser.</p></div>"
144,fall,2007,f2007,paul-smith,"Paul Smith doesn't really do theme-y collections. Whatever the season, his concept revolves around the brand of modern Britishness he has personally made accessible throughout the world. For Fall, though, he seemed almost inadvertently to have picked up the current twenties vibe in drop-waisted Deco chiffon dresses, long lean cardigans, fluid pants, and the odd shawl-collared Poiret coat. Since these were followed by a section of gamekeeper-check knickers and vests and a khaki WWI greatcoat, it was easy to think, just for a moment, ""Aha, of course! <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover</em>,"" and ""What a clever English spin."" It was only a flash, though, because after that it was back to the natty pinstripe pantsuits, some randomly misplaced neon knits, and tux tailoring for evening. Not that any of this was a letdown particularly, but by the end, that intriguing D.H. Lawrence moment had vanished from memory among the general merchandise.</p></div>"
145,fall,2007,f2007,peter-jensen,"Peter Jensen, a Dane living in London, always finds an obscure muse to get him started. This season, it was a northern Renaissance princess, Christina of Denmark, who jumped out at him from a 1538 painting in the recent Holbein exhibition at the Tate Britain. He studied her coif and browless, alabaster looks, and observed her sober, black fur-trimmed mourning coat and white, high-frilled blouse, then turned his back and started playing around.</p><p>The result, as always, had a kind of truehearted mix of Scandinavian inventiveness and practicality about it. Long, meringue ball gowns made of bunchy black nylon were layered over black sweaters; sensible wool checks were bias cut into jackets and coats; and funny little gray knitted hoods came off somewhere between medieval armor and jokey cats¿ ears.</p><p>Jensen¿s grounded focus on making nice-and-normal things to wear saved his theme from any pretentious historicism. What he¿s good at is providing interesting variations on young and sporty pieces like, say, teal corduroy shirtwaisters and jackets—the kind of honest, everyday stuff other designers overlook in the rush to make statements. On the other hand, the velvet-wrapped hair and pale Holbein makeup gave this tenth-anniversary collection quite enough charm to maintain the balance between art and commerce.</p></div>"
146,fall,2007,f2007,peter-som,"Peter Som transitioned from Spring's eighteenth-century romp to a Fall collection that had echoes of the nineteenth in the peak shoulder of a Chantilly jacquard coat, the ruff on a blouse, the whisper of a train. This gregarious designer's fan base relies on him for a pretty dress, something to wear to an event like the annual Neue Galerie soirée. His crowd is bound to find a suitable pick among the (rather too wide-ranging) evening options, from a blush-colored dinner dress to a layered black cocktail number with a touch of the siren.</p><p>But it was the day looks that were strongest here. The lineup felt less saccharine than past outings. It also pointed downtown, not just up—a good direction for Som to be traveling in. So if one of his front-row favorites like Tinsley Mortimer or Zani Gugelmann wants to vary her routine and try lunch at Café Cluny instead of BG, let her go to Som for clothes that will work in any ZIP code: superslim pants, an oversize short-sleeved sweater, a washed (i.e., not too tough) leather jacket, and a dark faille trench with a lot of flair.</p></div>"
147,fall,2007,f2007,peter-soronen,"People who scope out the red carpet with the intensity of a Red Sox fanatic at Fenway Park will recognize Peter Soronen's name. Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Jessica Parker have been ""papped"" in his dresses. An expert corsetiere, Soronen started selling his pieces at Barneys six years ago. ""Peter's work appeals to a very discerning customer, someone who can have anything she wants,"" commented Julie Gilhart, the store's fashion director. Now, for the first time, Soronen has made the jump to the runway—and his debut, while hardly flawless, served to give a wider audience a good idea of what this designer's all about.</p><p>A ribbon-laced corset made of sheets of copper was mainly a showpiece (or a fetishist's special order), but a cream satin flute-back gown with jet embroidery was not unworthy of Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina. An asymmetrical scarlet satin gown had Dita Von Teese's name written all over it; yes, Soronen's aesthetic tends toward the forties. Anomalous, but beautiful, was a chiffon gown printed with forest-floor flora: While corseted, it emphasized <em>flou</em> over form. A bit of Soronen trivia for those obsessive fans out there: He has fashioned Napoleon and harlequin stage costumes for Fischerspooner, the electroclash duo that did his runway music.</p></div>"
148,fall,2007,f2007,phi,"With any other designer, you'd expect a show described as the collision of Japonisme with Mick Rock's iconic glam-rock photographs of David Bowie and Queen to be a pretty over-the-top affair. But in the house that Susan Dell built, clothes are a serious business, both aesthetically and otherwise. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. The ""I want that in my closet"" appeal of Phi designer Andreas Melbostad's Fall collection was excitement enough.</p><p>Backstage after the show, Melbostad talked about revisiting and repositioning utilitarian wardrobe staples like the duffel coat, the trench, and the biker jacket—sensible words to anyone who knows how most women shop. He recast these classic items with tightened, elongated silhouettes in an edgy dark palette of mostly black, navy, and gray. To keep boredom at bay, the designer created subtle textural interest, mixing tactile fabrics like leather, knits, shearling, and a nubby alpaca wool. Proportion and layering were also part of the story: Sleeveless hooded coats were worn over sweaters and pin-tucked shirtdresses.</p><p>Suede vests hinted at Rock's louche seventies. Elsewhere, a Japanese stencil print subtly flashed from a dress worn under a massive toggle-buttoned cardigan. Melbostad's show is often criticized as being repetitive, but in a season with more than 200 collections, it's a relief to see a designer whose message is Baccarat clear.</p></div>"
149,fall,2007,f2007,philosophy,"Taking a cue, perhaps, from fellow Milanese designer Miuccia Prada, Alberta Ferretti has taken her second collection on the road. Where Prada chose Paris for Miu Miu, Ferretti settled on New York. Her reasoning? A growing celebrity following, increasing stateside sales, and, not least, because ""it's an exciting city for fashion."" Indeed, her Philosophy debut could have been lost among the week's 220 other shows, but thanks to a convenient location just a few windy blocks from the Narciso Rodriguez show, editors and buyers breezed in and out of her hassle-free installation all night.</p><p>What they saw was signature Ferretti: pretty, retro frocks, this season with a glam fifties vibe. Think tweedy skirtsuits and strapless, nipped-waist dresses in jewel-tone satins or brocades, with a smattering of schoolgirl pinafores and trapeze coats thrown in. By design, there was nothing new here, but Ferretti did play to what she called New York's modernity, with techno touches like floral and transparent laminates, the latter of which gave a boxy plaid jacket and A-line skirt a glossy sheen. Will Ferretti be back for more next season? Unlike some other newcomers, she has the money and the infrastructure behind her, so if she wants to compete for New York's attention, she can.</p></div>"
150,fall,2007,f2007,pollini,"Until the Pollini show, there hadn¿t been much allusion, direct or indirect, to the conflict in the Middle East this season. Rifat Ozbek changed that with his second look out: an innocuous-looking short silver shift that on closer inspection revealed an embroidered figure—arms in the air, mouth agape—plucked straight from Picasso¿s <em>Guernica</em>. (Of course, this being Ozbek, a designer who always has a lot going on, and this being fashion, it wasn¿t immediately clear how many in the audience had noticed his cri de coeur.)</p><p>Ozbek kitted out his power babes with all sorts of military regalia, most of it less in-your-face than that opening salvo. Tone-on-tone frogging decorated the collars and lapels of parkas and coats. A black silk jacquard used for a coat-dress and a jacket-mini combo looked for all intents and purposes like a miniature camo print. Then there were the green, red, and purple berets and the leather bags slung around the hips, fanny-pack style.</p><p>On the softer side were little dresses with flowers for epaulets and tops decorated all over with chiffon rosettes that were worn with short shorts in a substantial gray-wool knit. All in all, it was a good effort from Ozbek, and those dresses and rosettes were very pretty. (But pretty enough to make you forget the op-ed rumblings of a potential U.S. invasion of Iran, now that Ozbek's brought up the subject? That¿s a different question.)</p></div>"
151,fall,2007,f2007,prada,"Having to précis Prada is one of the toughest mind games in the business. All critics know is that they might as well leave their usual compasses at the door: Whatever Mrs. P is onto next is guaranteed to throw ready-made vocabulary and easy references into disarray. How, then, to capture the meaning of a show that started with a plain gray mannish coat and then moved into boxy, furry, laminated, bubbling, natural-cum-synthetic color and texture? Meaning, schmeaning, says Miuccia. As the anxious hordes pressed backstage for an intellectual coda from the oracle, she gave them a friendly Italian laugh. ""Eh! The only thing I could think of was to work on color and materials,"" she shrugged. ""Something simple but strange.""</p><p>Simple but strange: She said it. In a way, the schoolgirl coats, gray uniform cardigans and jumpers—and the sort of intransigently unsexy girl who wore them—seemed to be a return to the minimalist nineties character of Prada's early collections. Simple, but not quite: Some of the coats now have capelike slits where the sleeves should be, or a nice twenties slouch in the back, caught into a low half-belt. The strange? That came fast and furious with the addition of tufty mohair, first on the front of a cardigan, then as shaggy coats—this season's fur replacement. Then, to make it all the more complex, there was a running contradiction between rough-hewn primitivism (like raw-edged tan leather) and almost toxic plasticized orange, bright green, and off-turquoise, laminated onto spongy knits.</p><p>Suffice to say, the color-blocking was brilliantly original, and further offset by the bonkers footless two-tone socks thrust into weird backward-curving cone heels. As for subtexts, one might be Mrs. Prada's penchant for walking holidays in the mountains—hence the socks, the woolly ski beanies, and, maybe, the extraordinary fabrics woven to change from black to bubbly outcrops of rocky brown and grass green. Was this an abstraction of screes and verdant slopes seen from afar? Oh, let's not get pretentious. As Miuccia Prada is the first to point out, it's all fashion—better processed by the eye than justified by any number of words. Just judge by the pictures, then. All you might want to factor in is this one extra, invisible subtext: a soundtrack of some very angry girls, chanting lines like ""poke his eyes out."" If Miuccia really did breathe in her inspiration with the alpine air, she didn't exactly come back with <em>The Sound of Music</em>. Instead, she created a collection that seems destined to be one of the pivotal influences of the season.</p></div>"
152,fall,2007,f2007,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Although one has to tolerate a special kind of torture by concept to see a Preen show, it can be worth it. Vast banks of retina-scalding white neon lights provided the agony this time, meaning that those without dark glasses spent most of the show barely able to open their eyes. Those who did manage to peel their lids back for a few seconds clocked the fact that Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton are also playing the reference-the-late-eighties game.</p><p>It's a very London thing. Where Christopher Kane and Marios Schwab have alluded to Versace, Alaïa, and, as of this week, Romeo Gigli, Preen are the first to make a bid to bring back Claude Montana. However consciously, something about their large, round-shouldered bubble-gum-pink blousons; cowl-hooded knits; and zip-bisected body dresses made an uncanny parallel to the commercial collections Montana used to design in Italy, right down to the top-tights-ankle-boot color coordination. In fairness, Preen can't be castigated for direct copying. They clearly put a vast amount of work into the horizontal pleating effects they used throughout the show, and into the huge number of fawn, purple, and black variations on their theme. As a matter of fact, they could save themselves a lot of trouble if they only did half the work. It would certainly have made for a more concise collection this season—and spared the audience a migraine.</p></div>"
153,fall,2007,f2007,pringle-of-scotland,"If there were any lingering doubts about Pringle¿s identity or the viability of another British revival, Clare Waight Keller went a long way to putting them to rest today. She opened the show with a look that nicely referenced the Scottish cashmere house's heritage: a double layer of slate-gray cable sweaters topping a short, flirty skirt with a ruffle circling the hips. In a season of luxe, chunky knits, hers were the best yet: dense and cozy, without being droopy. And they were innovative to boot. The yoke of a black A-line coat was cashmere crochet, the collar of a silvery lambskin jacket was an oversize mohair cable. Meanwhile, color-blocked fine-gauge cashmere layers—tunics over turtlenecks over slim skirts—looked almost weightless.</p><p>Riffing on and simultaneously moving beyond the company¿s foundations, Waight Keller used a woven fabric, printed trompe l¿oeil-style to look like an oversize knit, for a bubble dress and a lamp-shade number. Poufy volumes are still a fixation in Milan, but—credit her tenure at Gucci—she also cut a convincing skinny pant. And she nailed evening, too. A burgundy silk-satin top worn over a matching skirt with pleats and a banded hem balanced polish and cool in equal measure. Like other outfits in this show, it proved Pringle can give young women what they really want.</p></div>"
154,fall,2007,f2007,proenza-schouler,"Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough are fashion's early adopters. The Alaïa references that have been spotted on the runways this week? So last season. They've moved away from their Spring outing's essentially spare sensibility and rediscovered the interest in surface decoration that informed some of their best collections. Coats, for starters, were a veritable patchwork of materials, with wool bodies, popcorn-knit sleeves, and fur collars or fur-lined hoods. Some necklines were studded with patinaed crystals. Minimalists may find the overall effect a bit much, but the workmanship was beyond question.</p><p>Paul Poiret, the twentieth-century innovator whose many hallmarks included East Asian motifs, and whose oeuvre will go on display at the Costume Institute come May, could've been one of the show's touchstones. His influence was there in cocooning kimono jackets, the standout of which came in white-and-black fur-trimmed jacquard. And you could see it in the vintage-y twenties dresses dripping in jet. Other embellishments had a more modern dimension. Intricate pleats zigzagged up and down the fronts of chiffon dresses, or crisscrossed at the bodice in a way that resembled the bustier shapes for which this duo is loved. Radzimir dresses in luscious jewel tones were treated similarly.</p><p>If these rarefied clothes have a small target audience, that's sort of the point—especially now that the boys have proved they can reach a large Target audience any time they want with the instant success of their recent high-low collaboration. Exquisite details? Cheap chic? These two talents excel at both.</p></div>"
155,fall,2007,f2007,rag-bone,"David Neville and Marcus Wainwright have been honing denim for five years now, but they're still relative newcomers to women¿s ready-to-wear. This time, they cannily mixed equestrian and military references in with their unstudied-cool signature looks. Their reliably sexy stovepipe jeans, for instance, were paired with assured cutaway jackets and double-belted cardigans with elbow patches. Roomier tuxedo pants, with contrasting stripes, were topped by a boyish vest and crisp button-down, or a smart side-closure jacket that fell capelike to the waist.</p><p>More girly were the trapeze dresses over skinny pants. While hardly new—Sienna Miller sported the same in the front row—the look was strong: The pants were as thin and easy as leggings, yet scads more chic. The Rag &amp; Bone duo has always had an eye for luxe, but there was a noticeable uptick in their fabrics (especially the tan wool plaid that was cut into a short jacket and a pleated knee-length skirt to open the show). So it was a disappointment to see shoes that were clunky and, in one case, coming apart at the heel. Ultimately, though, they didn't weigh down a confident collection that showed marked strides in cut and fit.</p></div>"
156,fall,2007,f2007,ralph-lauren,"Leave the 180-degree turns, the frantic grasping for new ideas, to other designers. Ralph Lauren delivered one more in a line of self-assured collections today, and even better, proved he still has the power to surprise.</p><p>Returning home from last season's jaunt across North Africa and India, this urbane show began with suits—the first was long and lean, with a closely fitting, cropped double-breasted jacket and a skirt in the slim, three-quarter length that now looks fresh again. From there, he took the season¿s knit-dressing trend in a new direction. First, classic cardigan coats in hand-knit metallic tweeds cut a reliably elegant figure. Then—and here's the surprise—he whipped up strappy little cashmere dresses with short, kicky skirts. They had real youth appeal. The nipped-waist shape was echoed elsewhere in the collection—in slim turtlenecks worn with dirndls; in a chocolate flight jacket and matching flaring skirt; and in a couple of great-looking coats. These were slim on top and full to the knee, and the best one came in the antiqued gold that was the only flash amid the blacks, browns, and grays.</p><p>But in Lauren¿s world, after-eight dressing will always call for something sinuous. This season, that meant a pair of exit-making black gowns, one with a giant bow at the lower back and another with an organza ruffle from nape to ankle. Along with a daring, plunge-front dress in burnished gold lamé, they were surefire hits.</p></div>"
157,fall,2007,f2007,ralph-rucci,"Ralph Rucci celebrated his 25th anniversary in business last month with a retrospective at the Museum at FIT. It's quite possible that many of the pieces in tonight¿s show are destined for museum collections of their own, so remarkable is his workmanship and extravagant the embellishments. Rucci isn¿t content to cut a suit in copper double-face cashmere; both jacket and skirt are overstitched in gently arcing swirls of bas-relief. And a series of dresses from his Spring Couture collection, which constituted the second portion of this stately affair, were embroidered with curving shapes straight out of a Louise Nevelson collage.</p><p>Perhaps with an eye to his next quarter century, Rucci¿s loftiest creations were balanced by pieces with a rather more youthful appeal. Take, for instance, a natural Mongolian lamb chubby striped across its center with chocolate brown, or the beige chinchilla spiral jacket intercut with cognac leather macramé. It was easy to picture either of them draped over the shoulders of one of the fur-loving socials swanning about during fashion week. But the likeliest contender for the youth vote was a dress that fell in smoky tiers of organza to the floor, free of all embellishments save for a jewel suspended like a secret from a delicate back strap. For all that, if Rucci really wants to put a new generation under his couturier spell, he'll have to trim his overlong presentation, change the music, and lighten up the hair and makeup.</p></div>"
158,fall,2007,f2007,reem-acra,"With brilliant jewel velvets and golden jacquards, Reem Acra was shooting for ""modern decadence."" Her cleverest conceit for Fall was an unexpected play between front and back: Coco Rocha, for example, greeted the audience in a gleaming emerald silk charmeuse dress, but when she turned and headed back up the runway—hey, presto!—she was trailing a waft of chiffon.</p><p>Focusing on the vibrancy of these colors and textures, Acra kept decoration to a minimum, indulging mainly in Deco-beaded shoulder straps and belts on the pretty (if too numerous) velvet flapper frocks. There was a hint of Paul Poiret in a fur-trimmed manteau and a taffeta coat with a sack-back. But the bias-cut pants, in chiffon and velvet, had more of a matronly than vintage appeal.</p></div>"
159,fall,2007,f2007,reyes,"José Ramón Réyes, a native of the Dominican Republic and a Parsons grad, cited Elle Macpherson as the muse for his runway debut, an eighties sportswear-inspired collection that included exposed zips, drawstring waists (a mini-trend of the season), neoprene, technical nylons, and touches of fluorescent. Some of Réyes' more literal takes on the trend, like an exaggeratedly boxy striped ""kangaroo"" dress, seemed destined to go no further than the runway, but his sloped-shoulder utility tops and track pants had legs. You could imagine MisShapes regulars sporting the fitted or funnel-necked dresses at Don Hill's, while a velvet sack dress wouldn't scare off a leggy girl who spends Saturday nights at Tenjune with her investment-banker boyfriend.</p></div>"
160,fall,2007,f2007,richard-chai-love,"¿I remember coming to the city with my skateboard in the eighties,¿ said Richard Chai a few days before his show. ¿There was such an artiness to the way people dressed.¿ But the grittiness of the Amy Arbus and Nan Goldin photos from back in the day pinned to his inspiration board was only half the story. Chai enjoys the push and pull of opposites, so he attempted to marry to his original motivation a sense of airy romance and refinement.</p><p>A tall order, sure. But Chai, for the most part, was up to the task. Coats and jackets were the high point. They were many and varied, a chocolate-box assortment, from an edgy-cool patent-leather blouson to a wool chesterfield. Outerwear, it seems, best absorbs Chai¿s forward-thinking fascination with circular seaming and tweaked proportion. Elsewhere, he cut strict, skinny pants in shiny menswear jacquards—potentially a tough sell, but they paired well with chic popcorn knits and belted peplum jackets. As for the ethereal element, an Easter egg¿colored jacket worn with a white tulle tutu was a bit baffling; but the simpler pearlized organza-and-silk dresses in deep jewel tones were undeniably elegant.</p></div>"
161,fall,2007,f2007,richard-nicoll,"¿American football. Cheerleaders. Angie Bowie. Mr. Fish¿. These were the inspirations Richard Nicoll rattled off backstage before his show, adding for good measure, ¿It¿s joyful daywear inspired by eveningwear.¿ Actually, what he meant was that he¿d found some new things to do with shirts, specifically the signature striped, bib-fronted men¿s style for which he¿s received a lot of recognition these past two seasons.</p><p>The best pieces were the most elaborate, in black-and-white stripes falling to long, curved tails front and back, finished with piping details, corseted implants, pie-frill peplums, belts, and chunky Swarovksi buttons. Some had shoulder patches picked out in crystal, and others had stars appliquéd into their flanks. A couple of sweatshirt-inspired reproportioned knits with deep ribbing added a new dimension to the collection. Where he went wrong was with the fringe and cross-lacing. It might have seemed like ironic, playful Americana in the studio, but it messed up a few too many outfits to be funny.</p></div>"
162,fall,2007,f2007,rick-owens,"""I was looking at the work of the French cartoonist Sens, who did caricatures lampooning Poiret women as insects,"" said Rick Owens backstage before his show. That just might be the most meta inspiration of the season, given fashion's current fascination with the great couturier. It's certainly among the most unusual, and it produced one of Owens' most precise and accomplished shows yet. Paring back on the decorative confections of his last collection, the designer played with volume and texture to create what he called simple, primitive shapes. But if his skirt silhouette—a draped jersey design with the hint of a slit—remained unchanged from the first to the last of his 35 looks, there was nothing simple about the show's jackets and coats. Among them: shaggy mohair cocoons with stiff, rounded leather collars that arced away from the collarbones in a graceful ellipse; sleek sheared-mink vests with twin lapels falling to the same side; and other toppers with stand-up collars-cum-hoods and rounded backs that looked like a beetle's hard casing.</p><p>The highlights, though, were undoubtedly the shearlings. With their nipped waists, exaggerated face-framing collars, and cutaway tails, they deftly walked the barbarism/sophistication line that Owens has made his calling card. You could complain that the show was singular in its focus on outerwear at the expense of all else, but with looks as smashing as Owens' shearlings, why bother?</p></div>"
163,fall,2007,f2007,roberto-cavalli,"Glamazon looks are what Roberto Cavalli is famous, or perhaps notorious, for. But over the past few seasons, he¿s been reining things in at his signature line. Today's runway set looked straight out of old Hollywood, and the clothes like something borrowed from the soigné wardrobe of a Clark Gable and Carole Lombard flick. Models sported slim safari jackets, swaggering furs with toggle closures, and jodhpurs (OK, jodhpurs aren¿t the most flattering look invented) with crisp, mannish button-downs and matching ties. The Lombard part of the equation came in billowy dressing gowns in Liberty peacock prints, more structured forties-style dresses (a real Fall trend), and a great-looking silvery short fur over a demure satin dress that turned to reveal a thigh-high slit.</p><p>The masculine/feminine theme extended into evening, where Cavalli showed black smokings and boxier suits in white satin alongside the hot cha-cha gowns that are his stock-in-trade. Of the latter, a metallic-blue bustier number with an asymmetric strap and a green goddess dress crisscrossed with sequin bands looked light and youthful. A beaded-all-over halter and a clingy gold sequin column with a fishtail hem, on the other hand, looked less fresh, and brought flashbacks of the brasher Cavalli of yore. The designer, like his front-row star, Steven Tyler, may be a rocker forever, but he has been wise of late to steer his work in a more elegant, even decorous direction.</p></div>"
164,fall,2007,f2007,rodarte,"The Mulleavy sisters have a way of provoking strong reactions, pro or con. As always, the quality of their workmanship was meticulous for Fall; so much so, one editor commented, ""that it's almost painful.""</p><p>The show veered between two Mulleavian extremes: the fantastic and the classic. While the more radical experimentation with volume helps them stand out in the Manhattan fashion landscape—and was successful on the opening coat, for example—other pieces, though undeniably sophisticated, seemed almost too rare to touch.</p><p>The sisters collaborated with Swarovski, resulting in twinkling embroideries on Bianchini brocades from the 1920s and on some unusual laminated fabrics. The designers took joy in molding new materials into different shapes. A fake leather, for example, was worked into a lean, mean pair of pants, worn with a hand-knit sweater-vest and a lace top—all of which managed to look almost casual in relation to the Poiret-like lamp-shade dresses at show's end.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zxkk8j""></div></div><p>Needing less explication or argument were the goddess gowns. Jessica Stam wore a one-shouldered blush-colored one that clung about her like mist. Another featured twisted pendant trimmings with glistening oil-black jet beads. The finale dress, in ombré pinks, had pinked edges inset into wafty waves of pleats—and a sigh went up in the room. In the end, all of the talk and palaver is just further proof that fashion takes Rodarte seriously.</p></div>"
165,fall,2007,f2007,roksanda,"Back in the day of bias-cut mermaid dresses, Roksanda Ilincic was a lone London eccentric pumping up volumes in taffeta and duchesse satin. Now that the world is completely at ease with balloons, cocoons, trapezes, and megaflounces, her inflated shapes seem, if not exactly mainstream, then quite plausible for many a quirky party girl. ¿This season, I was interested in waves and motion,¿ she said, making flowy movements around her body with her long, pale fingers. The gesture made a good visual description of the bands of milliner's crin that served as volumizing decoration, rippling and whooshing along the edges of dresses, capes, and jackets.</p><p>Ilincic¿s appeal is in the spontaneity and refreshing lack of pretention she brings to her homages to old-world couture. The novelty of the frilly crin wore off with repetition, but there was something clever in the way it extended shapes (particularly shoulders) without adding bulk. Since her prices aren¿t astronomical, pieces like the flouncy capes and high-necked dresses are certain to be taken for many a whirl by girls who don¿t take their evenings too seriously.</p></div>"
166,fall,2007,f2007,rue-du-mail,"Martine Sitbon left the Paris runway scene in 2004, but judging by the arty crowd at her comeback show (her new collection is named after the address of her atelier), she's hardly been forgotten. One of the things she's remembered affectionately for is an edgy sense of romanticism, but at first today she worked more of a tough chic vibe. A streamlined black satin trench was followed by other tailored pieces with doubled collars and padded details on the sleeves.</p><p>There were also plenty of sweet dresses, though. They trotted out on wedges and stacked-heel pumps, and in keeping with the swing of things, hems were short and silhouettes were full. The weak link was a clunky number made from what looked frankly like a cream chenille bedspread. The best pieces were almost sculptural, with wire hems that circled the legs, curving gracefully at one knee to create an abstract flower and reveal asymmetric tiers beneath. In the mix were lots more bubble and lamp-shade shapes.</p><p>Her fans seemed pleased enough with all this, but it bears noting that the competition for attention in the crowded French calendar has become even more fierce since Sitbon's departure; to maintain the enthusiasm she was greeted with today, she may have to kick things up a notch or two.</p></div>"
167,fall,2007,f2007,ruffian,"¿If Nan Kempner hung out with Bob Dylan in the West Village in the fifties, this is what she would've worn,"" Brian Wolk said backstage at the National Arts Club, Claude Morais standing by as if about to jump in and finish his partner¿s sentence for him.</p><p>And, yes, you could absolutely picture Kempner, the late, rail-thin clotheshorse whose style is currently being celebrated at the Costume Institute exhibit, in the duo¿s second-skin (""molded,"" they called it) stretch-charmeuse top and high-waisted silk-faille trousers. She would¿ve just loved the ruffle flounces that traipsed along the lapel of a wrap jacket and down the neckline of a halter.</p><p>Ruffian has long bandied about the aspirational term ¿American couture,¿ and it's always seemed anachronistic that they should design for women of Kempner¿s generation and tax bracket. But perhaps their focus is shifting. While it was clear they hadn¿t exactly raided the bargain bin when it came to fabrics—all that polished wool, silk taffeta, and sequins—plenty of the pieces would look believable on, say, Olivia Palermo (the freshly anointed social darling who sat in the front row and, based solely on the number of shows she's hit so far this weekend, just might rival Kempner for fashion enthusiasm). In a Ruffian cashmere flannel A-line dress with snaps and exposed zippers, any twenty-first-century Nan would fairly glow.</p></div>"
168,fall,2007,f2007,saint-laurent,"If there is one connecting principle that ran through Yves Saint Laurent's hottest years, it was the way he picked up the beat of street ideas and transformed them into transcendent cut. For the first time, Stefano Pilati came close to nailing the essence of that bold philosophy, centering his collection on the mission to reshape form and give it a contemporary bite. That clarity of intent produced a fresh silhouette and a new proportion, designed around a precisely engineered upper-body volume—but that's just the technical side. Volume can be overwhelming, fattening, and fashion-victim-y, but here Pilati concentrated on offering chic women—and not just young women—a dashing, long-legged wardrobe eminently cut out for urban living.</p><p>The news was in the rounded, raglan-sleeved coats and menswear-derived jackets—and a multiplicity of textures scored, stamped, and bubbling up from concrete-gray and black surfaces (who else could make a gray ""fur"" out of knotted chiffon?). Before now, Pilati's enthusiasm for fabric innovation has run away with him, but he controlled it in the service of elegant shapes that stood away from the body. His jackets, starting with a gray, mannish blazer, captured the idea of ""oversized,"" but tailored it to form a bell-like volume in front—an idea that ended in a couple of sublime tuxedo jackets for evening (put on one of those, add a pair of black opaques, and you can forget the skirt).</p><p>If the achievement here was partly the sense that Pilati had rejected the burden of quoting too much literal YSL history, he also melded a significant reference into the collection that reached back to the radical beginnings of Saint Laurent's career. The subversive Left Bank spirit of the crocodile thigh boots that so shocked the establishment in the early sixties (and got Yves fired from Dior) rose again in a fiercely chic passage of black shiny nylon-look cloque, black hoods, gauntlets, and dark glasses. It was a timely reminder that all really new ideas are risky at first—before they get absorbed and worn by everyone months later. Pilati himself experienced that in the general panning his first YSL collection received, after which his belts, tulip skirts, and platforms were copied the world over. There's a chance that the newness in this show might stir up some of the same like-it-loathe-it controversy, but whatever the response, this much is already clear: Few designers in the world are applying themselves to modernity in this way, and that's an energy fashion sorely needs in order to go forward.</p></div>"
169,fall,2007,f2007,sari-gueron,"Sari Gueron isn't a designer given to grand themes or statements; she usually just prefers to make the kind of cool, unstudied clothes that girls clamor to wear. This season, however, she decided to give concepts a try. She described her starting point as an updated, woodsy fairy tale—an imaginary world populated with a Harry Potter book's worth of owls, images of which covered nearly every inch of her studio's inspiration board.</p><p>Still, Gueron is a pragmatist at heart, one who would never let concept trump wearability. For day, she mostly showed an urban take on cozy, countryside fare, all accessorized with black riding boots. Dark wool coats, capes, and dresses in slim silhouettes came piped with leather for a hint of subversion. Gueron is steadily shedding her reputation for being solely a dress designer, and here she delved further into separates, like the covetable chunky cardigans shown layered over her frocks. Along the way, the designer riffed lightly on her woodland theme; an ivory cotton-and-silk dress, its collar embroidered with abstracted owls, was both whimsical and chic.</p><p>Unfortunately, evening looks trimmed with a combination of jet crystals and glossy black feathers left one wishing for the slightly more low-key version of after-eight dressing for which Gueron is normallly the go-to girl. This show didn't strike as strong a chord as last Spring's, but with Gueron's first Resort collection hitting stores and a recent Fashion Group Rising Star nomination, she is still forging purposefully ahead.</p></div>"
170,fall,2007,f2007,sinha-stanic,"Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic have recently received a £60,000 business-development award. From the regimented looks on their runway, it would seem that the influx has them concerned with making sure the press and buyers are very clear about every option they have in their line. The show consisted of one basic shape—a short, body-molding template that appeared as a coat, a zip-front dress, or a skirt and shell—with a little (though not much) variety added by boleros and skinny, cropped pants.</p><p>In the London context, this is last year¿s silhouette. But the couple tried to add novelty by superimposing a Japanese samurai theme, using quilted leather, metallic fabrics, and cuts that mildly mimicked articulated plates of armor. A lot of handworked silver, copper, dull gold leather, and embroidery went into the finale coats, which turned out considerably more glam-rock than shogun. Still, they weren¿t enough to overcome the repetitious nature of what preceded them. In the end, this felt more like a literal-minded line presentation to financial types than an inspired fashion show. Sinha-Stanic may have had to do a lot of the former recently, but they shouldn¿t equate the need to prove their business savvy with an exciting proposition for editors.</p></div>"
171,fall,2007,f2007,sonia-rykiel,"In a season of absolutely massive sweaters, Sonia Rykiel proved that she can still knit and purl with the best of them. Her cardigan coats weren't made with the biggest needles of the season—as of now, that distinction belongs to Giles Deacon—but they were draped, tucked, and puckered more playfully than all the rest. In fact, the flowering necklines, ruffling lapels, and boxy pleats at the hips will make them challenging for all but the most willowy of sweater girls, so the designer applied similar motifs to candy-colored dresses in tulle and silk charmeuse.</p><p>It wasn't all soft and sweet, though. Rykiel also had the season's sexy peaked-shoulder jacket and pencil skirt. And she injected a touch of the <em>garçon</em>, with high-waisted wide-leg suspender pants worn over sheer gauzy tanks. Then, for the finale, she sent out every one of her girls in Mongolian lamb coats, colored hot shades of neon with contrasting holographic belts. These, of course, are one of the season's big trends, but they're also a Rykiel signature, and they made for an upbeat ending to a feel-good show.</p></div>"
172,fall,2007,f2007,sophia-kokosalaki,"Renzo Rosso, the Italian fashion magnate behind Diesel, Martin Margiela, and Dsquared, was the first to push backstage to tell Sophia Kokosalaki how many important editors were at her show, and how they're rooting for her. That must've been good for him to witness, because he's recently signed Kokosalaki to a business pact under which her clothes will be manufactured in his high-standard Staff International factory near Venice, thus liberating her from years of struggling to sort out production from her East London base.</p><p>Good news all round, then, and some of it is already apparent in her clothes. Kokosalaki's knack is in the balance between Greco-modern draped, pleated dresses and something cool but under-the-radar rocking in the outerwear. A giant black curly-haired lamb coat with goat-hair sprouting at the shoulder and a textured trench (silk, but made to look synthetic in the mood du jour) did the rocking, while the designer's newest dresses came in multipleated stretch panne velvet. With a business push behind her, Kokosalaki is carefully upping the luxury content of her collection while gradually figuring out how to extend her signatures to make a tight, special brand. It's not only press and buyers who are watching. One more immediate vote of approval came from Carmen Kass, who wore the best number here—an artfully twisted black satin dress. She was seen leaving the show with it tucked under her arm, singing Kokosalaki's praises.</p></div>"
173,fall,2007,f2007,strk,"""A runway show in New York?"" said an exhilarated (and slightly flustered) Camilla Stærk backstage. ""It's a big deal."" For Spring she had mounted a simple tableau vivant-style presentation of 12 looks on 12 models, but this week she put on a full-fledged show. It was an important move ahead for a designer who transplanted her studio here from London only months ago.</p><p>Stærk pointed to the experimental fifties filmmaker Maya Deren as an inspiration, for the artful way she dressed in that restrictive era. She also cited the ""isolated romanticism"" of Ian Curtis and Joy Division. Hence the New Order soundtrack, which momentarily conjured visions of the candy-colored gowns of Sofia Coppola's <em>Marie Antoinette</em>. Those expectations were soon swept aside by Stærk's austere looks, which offered subtle subversions of ladylike fare such as the shirtwaist dress and the matching shift and jacket. Shapely high-waisted skirts in white coated cotton were layered over bright T-shirts. A widow's-peak neckline gave a plain black sheath dress just a hint of wickedness. She even managed to make the Peter Pan collar look moodily sexy. Overall, it offered a more complete picture of what this designer's distinct vision is all about.</p></div>"
174,fall,2007,f2007,stella-mccartney,"The opening look at Stella McCartney—a frankly fake fur ingeniously fashioned from dense whorls of hand-tufted yarn—set the tone: Welcome to one of the least pretentious and most playful shows of Paris fashion week. The fun continued with knits, including a hard-to-miss oversize red-and-black cardigan woven into a polar-bear pattern. And last season¿s rompers grew legs, becoming fine-gauge jumpsuits in hot pink or sweatshirt gray.</p><p>It wasn't all games. Outerwear was sportif too, but also seriously chic. McCartney focused on loose, flaring, of-the-moment silhouettes like trapeze coats and capes. Hooded anoraks were adorably egg-shaped.</p><p>Fans of her sophisticated Savile Row suits, though, will have to content themselves with a satin-lapel smoking and a cropped, double-breasted jacket with brass buttons. The look at Stella is extremely young and very long on leg, which meant few pants and short, short, short hems on baby-doll smocks, petticoat dresses, and curvy bustier styles. For extra cheek, she paired them with ankle boots and socks. Count on McCartney to bring the charm.</p></div>"
175,fall,2007,f2007,tao,"Sporty knitting in neon pink and black—for Fall, that¿s the nub of Tao, the mini-collection designed by Tao Kurihara in her own separate nook at the house of Comme des Garçons in Tokyo. The designer bent her mind to layering cropped crochet tank tops over fine-gauge knits, running shorts, and sweatpants, then working in a substrand of black-and-white stripes and tiny, asymmetric ruffles. As a piece of condensed thinking about gym wear, it carried a lot of Kurihara¿s signature charm and accessibility, making it a part of Comme¿s output that¿s less a commitment to high-concept dressing and more a line of quirky pieces for young women to break down and incorporate into everyday wear. That, especially, goes for the big, wedge sneakers—not exactly designed for the running track, but, then again, one of the season¿s rare footwear compromises between fashion and comfort. For a crowd suffering from four toe-crushing weeks in platforms, they were a sight for sore feet.</p></div>"
176,fall,2007,f2007,temperley-london,"¿Beauty in exile,¿ said Alice Temperley before her show. ¿It¿s all about the Russian emigration to Paris after the Revolution.¿</p><p>Following a plain-Jane Spring showing, the invocation of Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes for Fall must have been sweet music to the ears of her steadfast fans. They¿re an international clique of girls who plunk down the plastic for her boho, ultrafeminine fare even in seasons when minimalism otherwise rules, and they¿ll likely love the crafty passementerie on the new blouses and dresses.</p><p>Shaking off her reputation for being solely a frock star, Temperley ventured further into more structured pieces: lean Victorian jackets, wide trousers, and tulip skirts. Tailoring isn¿t exactly her bag, but the jackets—especially a pintucked Le Smoking—were very worthy of attention. The ornate Byzantine headpieces were not: Such a costumey touch felt out of place in a line that is much more about wearability than grand gesture.</p></div>"
177,fall,2007,f2007,thakoon,"Thakoon Panichgul, recipient of a 2006 CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund runner-up award, showed a winning collection today at the Prince George Ballroom, building on the strengths of last season's flower-inspired show. As a former fashion journalist, the designer knows how to spin a tale, and one of the main characters in his romantic Fall story was Paul Poiret. Both the Frenchman's (in)famous lamp-shade dress and his house's signature rose were referenced, and Panichgul succeeded in modernizing the latter by working a floriated pattern in shimmering paillettes onto silk dresses.</p><p>However, rather than indulging in the 1,001-night fantasies Poiret favored, Panichgul focused on day and outerwear. Peacock-print silk dresses would work at the office or an art opening, while open-weave cocoon jackets and snappy seamed coats would be sure to stand out on the way to either. Panichgul even added a touch of sportiness, offering a chunky cashmere baseball cardigan—albeit one that looked better suited to a pitch meeting than the pitcher's mound. The terms ""tee"" and ""sweatshirt dress"" shouldn't be taken too literally, either, as the pretty items bearing these descriptions were sewn up in misty tulle and luxurious satin, respectively. The designer won't win points for some of his drop-waisted pieces, as they won't be flattering on many figures, but you can bet there will be a waiting list for the <em>coq</em>-feather dress and pencil skirt.</p></div>"
178,fall,2007,f2007,threeasfour,"Swapping the Dome at the Soho Grand for the swish environs of the National Arts Club, Threeasfour's Gabi, Ange, and Adi showed their most sophisticated collection to date. Pushing their signature circular cutting techniques and curving seams in new directions, they sent out an asymmetric pieced tank with a slimly wrapped tweedy skirt almost bourgeois in its tidiness. Then, fast on its heels, came an utterly cool metallic leather motorcycle jacket that tapered and draped from the model's shoulders as if she'd worn it for years.</p><p>Not all 21 looks were showstoppers. A gray silk gown spliced into heavy fringes drooped, and the head wraps don't have a chance off of the runway—likewise, let's hope, a fuchsia dress with cutouts at the torso worn by Lydia Hearst. But these were overshadowed by a number of better pieces. A quilted silk color-block jacket channeled the best of Koos van den Akker (whom insiders will remember was a big influence at Marc Jacobs and Balenciaga a few years back). And an ingeniously cut tendril of a dress had ruffles cascading from under the bust to the floor. When the model looped her hand under the strap ruffle at the shoulder and swung it out from her body, the graceful sweep of green silk crepe produced a collective sigh of appreciation.</p></div>"
179,fall,2007,f2007,todd-lynn,"Todd Lynn has chosen a narrow field in which to work: androgynous tailoring that works for both men and women. It's a smart decision, because apart from anything else, not many people have been doing that since Helmut Lang withdrew from the picture. It's also a bold decision, because as any expert cutter knows, it takes years to hone a signature in that exacting craft. So, the tightness and rigor in Lynn's second presentation was a pleasing thing to watch. It opened with a girl in a short, lean coat-dress, which, on a man, was worn as a jacket. That's Lynn's point: He adjusts the same shapes to fit both male and female, and mostly he managed to pull it off without turning either sissy or butch in the wrong places.</p><p>A short black wool jacket with a pointed front, worn with a white wing-tip collar, had an impeccable graphic punch on both sexes. The wide-legged trouser with a pleat implanted toward the outer leg was an improved reprise of a pant he showed last season, a refreshingly flattering alternative to the predictable skinnies. Meanwhile, shirts with subtle strips of lace running down the front and cutaway, high-collared jackets had something of a goth attitude about them—but minimal goth. Which is a good thing, because Lynn's prices are luxe-level, and these pieces are designed more to be keepers than overtly styled seasonal fashion. Even after two seasons, it seems clear that Lynn will be developing his cut by increments only—and the interesting thing is, that feels right.</p></div>"
180,fall,2007,f2007,tommy-hilfiger,"The last time Tommy Hilfiger showed on the runway, a year and a half ago, it was a party—the company's 20th birthday party, to be exact—with scads of celebrities, a movie, and a 100-look collection jammed with his greatest hits. But after a two-season break, Hilfiger has gotten serious. The Fall show featured a glossy black runway with a melancholy backdrop: the negative image of a redwood forest. There was a light smattering of celebs, but the front row lacked the zoo ambience of shows past. ""It's a rebirth, a new chapter in my life,"" Hilfiger said backstage.</p><p>To the bittersweet harmonies of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's <em>Sounds of Silence</em>, out came fresh-scrubbed sixties schoolgirls in toggle coats, tweed pinafores, and tartan trapeze dresses, all worn with knit tights. The sober New-England-in-winter color scheme was freshened up with flashes of primary color, to chic effect: a navy coat over a lemon-yellow dress and red shoes. Wool coat-dresses had an innocent, Katharine Ross elegance. Hilfiger has often mined an era or subculture for his ideas, but this effort captured the optimism of that decade without caricature. The clothes had a certain quiet refinement—all part of a well-considered repositioning of the brand. Asked whether this runway show will be followed by another, Hilfiger answered, ""Absolutely. It's good to be back.""</p></div>"
181,fall,2007,f2007,toni-maticevski,"""I have been working on pretty, floaty, feminine for so long,"" said Australian designer Toni Maticevski, who played Edward Scissorhands in his sophomore New York effort, slashing away at conventional notions of beauty and proportion. ""I felt I needed to add a bit more severity and grit.""</p><p>You could see echoes of thirties Hollywood in the long, sinuous lines and the embroidered balloon sleeves. But the fragile allure of these details was willfully sabotaged: Underneath a delicate ivory bias gown with beaded blossoms, for example, was a bondage-style bathing suit.</p><p>Intent on exploring the darker facets of his talent, Maticevski refused to give the audience what it expected. A simple black cocktail dress with a twisted neckline stood out, as did a minidress dripping with antique jet. But the choreography—with models aggressively (and strangely) clutching at their hips—was bound to be jarring for viewers who, after last season, came expecting a garden party. And the padded, Popsicle-colored puffer gowns brought ¿freak legend¿ Leigh Bowery to mind. Maticevski, explaining these last as ¿blow ups¿ of the thirties bias look, remained defiant: ¿You either love them or you hate them,¿ he said. For many in the audience, you suspected, it was a case of the latter.</p></div>"
182,fall,2007,f2007,topshop-unique,"The very English ritual surrounding the Topshop Unique show feels rather like the first day back at school. There are the weary seniors just arrived from the New York collections; over there are the fresh-faced enthusiastic juniors who've barely been to a show before; and there's Sir Philip Green and his family, Topshop's owners, observing who's present and correct. Then everyone knocks back cocktails and Champagne for an hour, and it's finally —oops, yes!—on with the show.</p><p>One notable absentee was Kate Moss, because this collection, designed by the in-house team led by Nick Passmore, has nothing to do with the model's forthcoming Topshop launch in April. Neither, in fact, has Unique much to do with the highly popular fast-moving merchandise that is Topshop's core appeal—it's more of a separate stab at a higher-priced collection available in limited quantities.</p><p>This season, the team settled on its own translation of a Biba-esque Art Deco theme. It was full of fit-and-flare dresses and coats with perked-up shoulders and belled sleeves, austerity-era geometric prints on satin, and long hand-knitted cardigans and vests. The best part of the show was the one item that leapt clear of all that—a pair of high-waisted black flared denims with deep, shoe-covering cuffs. Judging by the reaction—as all girls know, it's no mean achievement to come up with a newly flattering jean—Sir P. ought to be ordering them up in bulk overnight.</p></div>"
183,fall,2007,f2007,tory-burch,"She has what other designers spend their careers struggling to find: an eagle-sharp vision of what her line is and who her customers are, an unfailingly consistent aesthetic. Tory Burch is about easy-chic, modern-classic sportswear informed by the sixties and seventies. It might not be the reinvention of the wheel, but women from all walks of life go wild for it—in large part, because it¿s so reliably wearable.</p><p>Come fall, they¿ll be clamoring again. The show was presented in a raw loft space way over on the West Side, to tunes spun by the celeb-DJ trio the MisShapes. While maintaining her distinctly American sensibility, Burch flavored things up with a touch of Paris. ¿I was looking at French films and photos from the sixties—Catherine Deneuve,¿ she said. Again, it¿s not that the inspiration is unique—which designer hasn't cited the star of <em>Belle de Jour</em> at some point?—it¿s that the execution is so neatly done.</p><p><em>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</em> et al. were evoked in lots of great outerwear, from stylish trenches and peacoats to a slick black patent coat with fur cuffs and a three-quarter coat of striped, sheared mink. Burch¿s hit sequined minidress made another appearance, this time in light blue and silver. She showed her signature jacket in a delectable stiff brown silk, with crystals down the front, over a pair of insanely chic skinny white pants. Classic Tory…but isn¿t it always classic Tory?</p></div>"
184,fall,2007,f2007,tracy-reese,"""I like the shiny fabric, the rhinestones,"" said Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland, singling out several party dresses as Tracy Reese's models came out for the finale. The singer was attending a Reese show for the first time, but she said she had admired the designer from afar for her feminine fabrics and embroideries. This collection delivered those and then some. With baroque for a buzzword, Reese layered tulle over sequins and topped a hot-pink taffeta cocktail dress with a strawberry-red tunic coat. A flat bow decorated the hem of a boxy cropped jacket worn with a full skirt that had cartridge pleats marching down its front.</p><p>The hosiery got high marks from Rowland, too. But the polka-dot and striped tights that the designer made in collaboration with Hue—not to mention the heavy plastic bangles and earrings, and oversize fabric bows cinching the models' ponytails—were ultimately an annoying distraction from pretty clothes that could have easily stood on their own.</p></div>"
185,fall,2007,f2007,trovata,"The cat¿s out of the bag. Elisabeta and Nicolae Petrescu—the fashion week arrivistes who, along with their pet tabby, Leo, captivated New York's showgoers—aren¿t the Romanian artistocrats they've been pretending to be. Rather, they¿re a pair of aspiring actors, plus a professional feline, hired by Trovata¿s sole remaining member, John Whitledge, to model his new collection. They took an hour out of their busy appearance schedule on Wednesday to pose for Style.com¿s photographer.</p><p>Here¿s where it gets tricky. Whitledge¿s fall wares, like all of Trovata¿s previous collections, have a backstory, and it revolves not around twenty-first-century Eastern European sibling socialites, but a pair of New York City school teachers, Bridget Ann Davis and E.S. Barrington, circa 1981. The clothes, it follows, have a retro look ¿straight out of yearbooks from the early eighties.¿ Think shirtwaist dresses in colorful prints; stripey turtlenecks and full, dirndl skirts; chunky cable-knit sweaters; and wide-wale corduroys. But for their finer materials and signature charming linings, they wouldn¿t look out of place at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, where Whitledge once interned in the design studio. Can a collection like this sustain the interest and good will of New York¿s stretched-thin fashion community? Sure. But in order to keep elevating his basics, Whitledge will have to bring the same level of invention to his clothes as he does to schemes like the Petrescus.</p></div>"
186,fall,2007,f2007,tse,"""When you think about TSE, you probably think about a sweater, but of course we are so much more,"" Tess Giberson stated. She proved her point today with a spare and smartly edited Fall collection that included menswear for the first time. The strength of the show was the play of proportions. A fitted pair of stovepipe trousers, for example, formed the base of an ensemble that layered two long tops under a boxy jacket with dropped shoulders and cropped sleeves. Somehow, the effect was unforced.</p><p>That's not to say the collection was glitch-free—a series of droopy-crotched suspender pants come to mind, and it's doubtful the TSE customer will want to pay big bucks for a mini with deliberate runs, however clever the technique used to create them. ""We're not trend-driven,"" Giberson demurred. Then how do you explain the sexy fitted skirt (with the highest waist we've seen this season) balancing out a quilted puffer vest? Or the presence of that Fall 2007 must-have—a coat with sleeves of contrasting material—cleverly rendered here with a tweedy woven body and cable-knit sleeves?</p></div>"
187,fall,2007,f2007,tuleh,"Think of this pretty-pretty collection as an early valentine. Remember Bryan Bradley¿s luxe Vassar Girl collection a year ago, with its patrician air and pencil skirts? Well, Bradley says, ¿Now she¿s getting married."" (Hence the dreamy, sack-backed wedding dress that closed the show.)</p><p>These are good-looking pieces meant to appeal to the good-looking inhabitants of ZIP codes 10021 and 10012 alike. To win the hearts of the former (a.k.a. Park Avenue girls), there were snug cardigans and an hourglass jacket with fur-muff wrists. The kiss-print dress with a modern leg-of-mutton sleeve and the narrow pants that stretched sexily down over the heel would woo her art-collecting cousin below 23rd Street. As the line was conceived as a continuation of an earlier collection, it didn't stake out much new ground. Not every look was a winner, and we didn't totally lose our heads. But love was definitely in the air.</p></div>"
188,fall,2007,f2007,undercover,"In a season when the collision of the natural and the synthetic—and the inconvenient truth of global warming—seem to be hanging out there on the periphery of fashion-consciousness, Jun Takahashi has been quietly thinking things through in his own intelligent way. ""You can't tell whether a winter's going to be warm or freezing,"" he rightly observes. So now he's adapted NASA technology for the inner cladding of flimsy coats: His lightweight furs with climate-sensitive linings keep the body cool in heat and snug in a cold snap. He's also added waterproofing techniques to knits and wool coats designed to cope with the violent unexpected downpours that are increasingly part of everyday life.</p><p>Still, Takahashi isn't making any heavy apocalyptic weather of all this. True to the name of his collection, the content is mostly kept undercover, a secret understood only when you get up close. Outwardly, it's more about the clever and charming way he manipulates sporty knits, like gray jersey tracksuits, shorts over woolly tights, marled sweaters, knitted dresses with sheer yokes, and a cardigan dress made from quilted silver satin. For Undercover followers, there's still a signature subversion going on (check out the razor-blade paillettes at the end), but this collection is broadening its appeal from being a minority-taste art cult to something that is playfully accessible in an unusually smart way.</p></div>"
189,fall,2007,f2007,united-bamboo,"Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki were thinking about architecture. An origamilike building technique—¿blocks,¿ as they called them, of fabric folded in on itself to create a square—turned up in various guises, from the velvet-ribbon trim of an A-line dress to the waistband finish of a poufy plaid skirt. While striking on a navy coat and effective on a plaid shirtdress, in other instances all these folds didn¿t seem to do much but add bulk to even the slenderest of runway-model frames.</p><p>For the ironic hipster with a window office at an ad agency there were, as always, desirable revamped classics, like a toggle coat, a three-piece shorts suit, and tight gloves of shimmery, cyborg gunmetal. Black sheer stockings layered over opaque white tights, on the other hand, were a hard sell. An ensemble featuring a leather riding jacket and plaid jodhpurs was satisfyingly tough but seemed incongruous among dresses that looked like Edwardian children¿s clothes. The last look, a sequined frock with a petal-tiered bell skirt, was described in the program notes as ¿geodesic¿—as in Buckminster Fuller¿s dome—but might more simply have been labeled an homage to Paul Poiret.</p></div>"
190,fall,2007,f2007,valentino,"Watching a Valentino show, it's hard not to be overcome by a wistful attack of the ""if onlys."" If only we women really were that precious and adored. If only we had leisure to get together the Veronica Lake hairdo and the immaculate makeup. If only there were still gentlemen to put us on that pedestal…</p><p>Of course, its a wildly difficult stretch to imagine such a thing today, but in a season when so many designers are referencing forties movie-star glamour, Valentino Garavani is one old-school master fully qualified to take us there—if only for a few fabulous flashbacks. Once past the daywear—where he worked on puffing up the shoulders of shifts with fur sleeves, and glamorizing tunics over pants—the gorgeousness flickered intermittently into focus. But you had to keep your eye on the ball—or at least, the right ball gown: Valentino is one of the few designers still operating who persist in showing 70 outfits on a runway—a distinct challenge to a modern audience with an attention span permanently set to ""tell it to me quick."" Still, the lettuce-green satin dress, delicately ruched in the front with a sparkle on the shoulder, the cream column with a draped knot in the bodice, a hyacinth off-the-shoulder gown, and, of course, the showstoppers in Valentino's signature red made it well worth the wait.</p></div>"
191,fall,2007,f2007,vena-cava,"According to their program notes, Lisa Mayock and Sophie Buhai were thinking about gonzo bohemian excess and the hard-living adventurers Hunter S. Thompson and Ernest Hemingway, men whose lifestyles embraced ¿humor, liquor, depression, peyote and red wine, Paris and Big Sur.¿</p><p>That's not the sort of backstory you hear every day, and it was always going to be a hard concept to pull off, even for a pair of designers who have won a place in the hearts of fashion critics with their quirky charm. And in fact, it was mostly the quirk that was in evidence today. Sheer chiffon tunics and rumpled denim vests were bulked up with cargo pockets, a look unlikely to be embraced by many women. Two awkward dresses—a black flared knit and an olive silk shirtdress—came across as frumpy.</p><p>It was with simpler looks that the designers regained their footing. A stiff cotton-twill suit, belted at the waist, felt just right, and the tiered silk dresses were fresh, especially the short black number worn under a supple fawn-colored leather jacket. And there was nothing gonzo about the slim column gown that closed the show.</p></div>"
192,fall,2007,f2007,vera-wang,"Soft-focus romanticism is Vera Wang's stock-in-trade; she was a bridal designer first, after all. Whether she borrows from the ballet or travels back in time to early-twentieth-century Russia, as she did for Fall, there will always be embroidered tulle, metallic brocade, and glossy duchesse satin.</p><p>To these pretty Vera-isms, she added stiffened jackets belted and bustled in the back with a taut military elegance, and fabulously thin shearlings in black and midnight cropped high above the waist. For accessories, there were gloves that inched their way up the biceps and sturdy boots with medallions on the calves. In case this all proved a little moody, a little dark, for the luxe-loving Vera Wang girl, the designer embroidered the skirt of a cage dress with enough gold and bronze bullion to fill the Romanovs¿ coffers. She added panels of densely embroidered paillettes to dresses, then veiled them with net.</p><p>Babushkas aside, there was a lot going on in these looks. If her artsy layers didn¿t have the same effervescence as last season¿s did, chalk it up to her starting point: Yes, she mentioned the Bolsheviks in her program notes. But no matter: Pulled apart and taken piece by piece, there was real beauty to be found.</p></div>"
193,fall,2007,f2007,veronique-branquinho,"The wide-leg trouser is giving the sexy, skinny pant—dominant for the last couple of seasons—a serious run for its money. Veronique Branquinho, the Belgian designer with a knack for chicly understated tailoring, made them her focal point for Fall.</p><p>""I was interested in new volumes,"" she said backstage. ""Wider, A-line shapes for dresses, coats, and trousers."" She dismissed the idea that she was referencing the seventies, but hints of the Me Decade could be seen not only in the elongated silhouette created by ponchos but also in the muted, but not somber, color palette and in the socks worn with chunky high-heeled sandals. Still, Branquinho was right that there was nothing retro about this collection.</p><p>This is one of Paris' quieter shows, and due to inconvenient, out-of-the-way locations and an overcrowded schedule, it doesn't always get the attention it deserves. But loyalists have been wise to stick with her. The cocoon made from interlocking diamonds of wool, cashmere, and other knits; the forest-green cape with the foreshortened, peaked shoulders; and the sophisticated way she cut and matched plaids all showed a renewed confidence. This was one of her strongest shows in years.</p></div>"
194,fall,2007,f2007,versace,"Donatella Versace was the first person to find a good name for the elusive chemical-bright turquoise that has shot through the best collections of Milan: She called it litmus-paper blue. Her use of it was spot-on, as was a startling red and a single bolt of sulfuric green, as well as chic contrasts of black, camel, and white. Is this the most important news to come out of Versace? Maybe: Bold color innovation combined with a pared-down, superprecise shape can make a collection jump this season. It cross-references with both Prada and Jil Sander. Perhaps this is becoming the twenty-first century's first run at making minimalism exciting—and who would have guessed that Gianni Versace's little sister would be involved in that?</p><p>But she is. Donatella Versace has stripped off the gold Medusa heads, canned the scarf prints, and set about cutting a strong, feminine silhouette. ""It's about a bell shape. Controlled volume. Black and white—and color to put the life in,"" she said. The ""bell"" is actually a kind of molded hourglass, emphasizing the waist and hips, but constructed in a demi-couture manner that neatly avoids constricting vulgarity. Versace used it in techno-fabric dresses, jackets, and tailored coats, and in one amazing dyed red fox that had been shaved into that shape in the midsection.</p><p>Not that Donatella has fully restrained herself from channeling the more-is-more essence of Versace. You still see it at full vent in her varnished gunmetal crocodile coat with short flared mink sleeves, the hilariously excessive white powder-puff fur-and-patent bag, and, of course, the chain mail and draped, slit evening gowns. Still, the picture of what Donatella has to say is becoming clearer by the season. It's a cleaned-up image of a strong, expensive woman completely in charge of herself, and though there is eye-poppingly luxurious technique involved, the most striking development is just how wearable most of the clothes are beginning to look.</p></div>"
195,fall,2007,f2007,viktor-rolf,"Should anyone have the idea that today's models are a limp and weedy bunch, they might take a look at what they had to put up with—literally—at Viktor &amp; Rolf. First, the girls had to shoulder heavy steel rigs, further weighed down with tungsten lights and speakers, some of them built up high above their heads. Then, unable to bend or use their arms to balance, they were asked to walk the runway wearing giant, clunky high-heeled Dutch wooden clogs. As the rigs got bigger and the girls' expressions more frozen with fear, involuntary gasps escaped from the audience. ""Oh my God, she's listing!"" hissed one observer. ""I can't look!"" cried another. ""That poor girl's slipping!"" shrieked someone else.</p><p>By pure luck, no one did fall, and when the applause came, Viktor &amp; Rolf may not have realized it was all for the models' heroic endurance, rather than for them. The mild-mannered and scrupulously polite Horsting and Snoeren can hardly be suspected of being closet sadists, but in this case their concept crossed over into cruelty. At the end, if they'd come out rigged up themselves—in clogs—they might have gotten away with it, but whatever point they were (perhaps) making about how each of us walks through life in her own imaginary fashion show, it couldn't override the discomfort of the spectacle. Worse, no one was talking about the clothes as they left the show. In fact, they were inspired by Dutch folk costume: tapestries, checks, and pure white buttoned-up blouses, with a smattering of basic sportswear corduroy cropped pants in between. There was also something in the way that some of the skirts and evening dresses were hooked to the rigs that seemed fleetingly reminiscent of the manner in which costume dolls are pinned into packaging in souvenir shops. Unfortunately, though, it's almost impossible to concentrate on finer points like that when you're anxious that a young woman might be about to break her neck in front of you.</p></div>"
196,fall,2007,f2007,vionnet,"As a small but intense addendum to the season, what's going on at Vionnet deserves recognition. The name has been revived in a very rarefied, technically accomplished way by Sophia Kokosalaki, who was hired by the French owners of the dormant brand last season, in arrangement with Barneys New York, who are, for the moment, the sole stockists. ""It has to be French, formal, and pure,"" Kokosalaki said. ""I avoid festoonery and anything to do with cool Britannia, which I can do in my own line."" Following in the footsteps of Madeleine Vionnet, who laid down the fundamentals of twentieth-century dressmaking, is a daunting task, but Kokosalaki has taken it on in a way that shines a subtle sidelight on fashion's pent-up desire for simple-seeming but ultrarefined minimalism.</p><p>Sophia herself likes trenchcoats and dresses, and that's what she showed in her low-key, appointment-only presentation. It gave a close-up of some exceptional things. There was a pliant brown shearling coat with a small waist and a soft, undulating bounce in the skirt, one of the best of its kind seen all season. The draped, twisted, and knotted evening dresses, especially the one in silver silk lamé, gave a quietly impactful alternative for women who prefer to pass under the radar of red carpet branding. Integral here is the manipulation of superluxe fabrics to trick the eye: patinated silk that looks like leather, textured cloque that could be astrakhan, and minute dustings of pearl Lesage embroidery (taken from an original Vionnet sample) that, as Kokosalaki puts it, ""make it look as if you've been snowed on.""</p><p>The fact that the designer has taken lessons from the authority on Vionnet's complex cutting techniques is part of the magic, though she's intelligent enough to see that it isn't about being slavishly referential. In this collection, Kokosalaki worked on Vionnet's ""barrel"" shape rather than bias cutting. It produced, for example, a square-cut coat with a collar that can fold into place, or be left loose to create a standout shoulder line, according to whim or weather. The price tags are some of the highest in ready-to-wear, but so far the cost is proving no deterrent. Within three weeks, the spring delivery of Vionnet's little-publicized first collection had sold out, an indication that Kokosalaki's woman-flattering approach is very much on the right track.</p></div>"
197,fall,2007,f2007,vivienne-tam,"Paul Poiret has been cited by a zillion designers this week. This is partly in anticipation of the upcoming retrospective at the Costume Institute, but also simply because those waistless Poiret pear shapes are an inevitable next step in the Darwinian evolution of the silhouette. But of all those shows where his name was invoked, at Vivienne Tam it was the most difficult to see any actual evidence of Poiret in the clothes.</p><p>Season after season, Tam reworks the Chinese <em>qipao</em>. This go-round, she developed a <em>qipao</em>/twenties hybrid and overadorned it with ruffled bibs and geometric shapes ¿slashed¿ to expose flashes of the underlayering—and then added clunky, studded wood platform shoes for good measure. It was difficult to imagine where anyone could wear most of this: A lot of it was too fussy for the office but still not quite right for a night on the town.</p><p>A copper-sequined mesh dress was an exception, as was a satin trench with a quilted skull on the back, and a dress with a dragon-embroidered overlay and fur trim at neck and hemlines. Those worked because, unlike much of the rest, they were straightforward looks that hadn¿t been forced through some esoteric fashion filter.</p></div>"
198,fall,2007,f2007,vpl,"""I wanted to do this even before Nancy Pelosi was voted in,"" said VPL designer Victoria Bartlett, whose show—dubbed ""Modern Suffragettes""—was a sartorial homage to pioneering women through the ages. Drawing loosely from women ranging from Victorian suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst to Guardian Angel Lisa Sliwa, Bartlett gave herself a broad aesthetic palette, while keeping the utilitarian slant that has always enabled her collection to evoke the strength of the female form. This show built on the designer's longtime love of the details on uniforms and institutional garb, with a new and mostly successful emphasis on more literal military inspirations, such as well-tailored wool pieces liberally detailed with patch pockets. These were mixed with the forward-thinking, fluid jersey pieces that are a VPL mainstay, while styling touches like berets and boots underlined the march-for-a-cause theme.</p><p>Bartlett is doing some pioneering of her own. Having just garnered a Fashion Group nomination, and having joined up a year ago with a Japanese silent partner, this stylist-turned-designer is turning what began as a sideline lingerie label into a complete business. Bartlett's wider focus was apparent in the specially commissioned shoes made with Jean-Michel Cazabat and her great slouchy handbags in lightly distressed leather. They were big enough, of course, to hold everything for a woman who is busy changing the world.</p></div>"
199,fall,2007,f2007,wunderkind,"You couldn¿t help but feel a twinge of déjà vu: This was the second Paris showing for the peripatetic Wolfgang Joop, and it was an improvement on his first, but at times it felt like too unsubtle an homage to Alexander McQueen—from the models¿ frizzed and upswept hair down to the handkerchief hems of the bias-cut and asymmetrically draped frocks. Among the more obvious references were chiffon dresses with soft little bustles at the lower back and pleats fanning out from upside-down U-shaped seaming at the torso.</p><p>Like McQueen, Joop enjoys a bit of severe tailoring, and this collection had that, too, in the form of a black peaked-shoulder double-breasted jacket worn with a wrap skirt and net underlay, and coats so minutely studded with beads that they resembled shagreen. He isn't the first designer to propose jodhpurs this season, but that doesn't mean women are likely to go for them. On the other hand, a forties-ish dress with almost New Look proportions was a winner. Joop smartly lightened up on the accessories in general, but those PVC tights, especially in prophylactic nude, were a definite don¿t.</p></div>"
200,fall,2007,f2007,y-kei,"In case you hadn¿t noticed, there¿s been an Australian fashion invasion lately. And though you wouldn¿t expect that the Seoul-based husband-and-wife team Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang would be part of it, their new collection was in fact inspired by a trip Down Under. Specifically, they took as their central concept an intricate patchwork modeled after Lab architecture¿s glass-and-metal mosaic of buildings in Federation Square, Melbourne.</p><p>Though beautifully made, these patchworks—circling the yoke of a chemise or banding the bust of a silver jumper dress—didn¿t have much resonance. But that isn¿t to say the collection didn¿t have appeal. Especially interesting were the tight pants with buttons at the back of the heel, and a black silk-taffeta moiré tuxedo with four large bone buttons that would even turn Beau Brummell¿s head. The slinky, silky champagne-and-caviar dresses were pretty, too.</p><p>But the best looks were the more substantial, tailored ones: coat-dresses (a red moiré and a black double-breasted one) and a jacquard trapeze jacket with a drawstring closure. The pièce de résistance was a short, black sheared-mink coat with puffed sleeves. It fairly bloomed with fur roses.</p></div>"
201,fall,2007,f2007,y-3,"Now in its fourth season in New York, Yohji Yamamoto and Adidas' love child, Y-3, has become a fully entrenched part of fashion week. For Fall, the gymnasium at Hunter College was transformed over three days into an orange Y-3-logoed basketball court flanked by glossy black runways linked by a moving walkway. Digital clocks on either end counted down to showtime. (Shouldn't every designer have one of these?) Popcorn and orange vodka drinks were passed around. (Shouldn't every designer serve some of these?)</p><p>The show, however, didn't inspire the breathless raves that followed the fresh and energetic Spring effort. From the first look, a dark nubby cape knotted over an even darker sweater dress, it was clear that this was Yamamoto in moody mode (even with those orange leg warmers). Everything was layered to the hilt, with roomy knit dresses, mohair skirts, long zip cardigans, caps, leggings, and leg warmers over aqua socklike sneakers and boots. Colors were on the dark side, too, with pops of orange, red, and royal blue. Basically, it was an approximation of the consciously haphazard way teenagers dress themselves. But if that didn't make for one of Yamamoto's more fully realized presentations, it should yield plenty of salable items in the stores.</p></div>"
202,fall,2007,f2007,yigal-azrouel,"This Israeli designer's evolution from simply a special-occasion man to a full-fledged downtown designer continues apace. He has gained enough confidence, for one thing, to dip into accessories for the first time, with the introduction of a roomy patent-leather tote.</p><p>Azrouël's recently launched menswear line was also making its catwalk debut here—so perhaps it¿s not surprising that there was a masculine/feminine theme running through the show. ""This is a superpersonal collection,"" he said before the show. ""It¿s based on what I wear and what my girlfriend is going to want to wear."" For women, oversize chunky knits, some with elbow patches, looked like the sort of going-steady sweater worn to a high-school football game, circa 1950. Layering, which played an important role in the Spring collection, returned for fall, and a fine merino turtleneck worn under a pewter chiffon dress was one pairing that worked particularly well.</p><p>Mixed among the all-American collegiate looks and the studied casualness of the loose, layered jersey pieces (many printed, Margiela-fashion, with words and serial numbers) was a sporty herringbone coat with a huge buttoned collar. That one cool topper—plus a few precision A-line dresses in heavy fabrics—added the sharp bite that the collection might otherwise have lacked.</p></div>"
203,fall,2007,f2007,yohji-yamamoto,"The first look sent a ripple through the stunned audience. Out came the model in a leather coat and matching rolling suitcase printed and embossed with a double-Y logo that seemed to be poking rather obvious fun at the Louis Vuitton monogram—and taking a swipe at the corporatization of fashion in general. (Whatever Yamamoto's intention, it struck a wrong note.) More logo-leather tail coats followed, along with intarsia sweater dresses and biker vests, all layered over skinny pants and topped off with printed head scarves wrapped, knotted, and braided into the models¿ hair.</p><p>Next came an interlude of black-and-white polka-dot hoop skirts that at the touch of a switch revolved, the tiers of the most complicated one turning in different directions. Despite the inevitable comparisons that will be made to Hussein Chalayan (who sent out his own motorized showpieces last season), you could feel the audience breathe a sigh of happy relief. This was more familiar territory.</p><p>After a bride in a camel-on-white version of the logo pattern, Yamamoto returned to his signatures again in the show-closing series of strapless dresses variously tucked, pleated, and gathered, and worn over an array of pants, some cropped below the knee, others zipping narrowly at the models¿ Dr. Martens¿clad feet. The beginning of the show was off—Yamamoto¿s too sublime a talent to indulge in such unsubtle lampooning—but by the finale he was back at his best.</p></div>"
204,fall,2007,f2007,zac-posen,"This season the young-designer-struggling-to-find-a-voice has become a mini-theme, so Zac Posen¿s focused Fall show was a reassuring development. In his five-and-a-half years on the runway, the 26-year-old has made a signature of forties-inflected tailoring. And today there was a new polish to his suits, evident in their strong lines—some jackets had nipped waists, others flared capelike from the shoulder. A coat that was all collar, and a fur with ruffles—never the best idea—were rather less reliable. But a tweed day dress was a winner. With curving seams piped in black patent, it was cut to smartly maximize his model¿s hourglass potential.</p><p>When it came to eveningwear—Posen¿s first love—he reined in the exuberance that can sometimes get him in trouble. Still, he couldn¿t resist a statement gown or two—this season Agyness Deyn was charged with pulling off the requisite show-closing dress with the stiffly voluminous skirts. But Posen mostly stuck to slimmer silhouettes in body-loving stretch silks and colors that the camera adores. These—unlike some of the more showy pieces—have serious red-carpet promise, and the crowd ate them up.</p></div>"
205,fall,2007,f2007,zero-maria-cornejo,"¿Sex is overexposed,"" Maria Cornejo said. ""I want to express sensuality in a subtle way.""</p><p>She actually approached her goal in two ways. The first was through what were, for her, surprisingly delicate, feminine touches: a grosgrain-ribbon cascade that rippled down the front of an evening gown, or a slip layered under a gauzy dress. The second, via androgyny—though in this case it was less about girls looking like boys than about how they look in their boyfriend's clothes, and the interesting proportion play that ensues.</p><p>Perhaps because Cornejo's at her best when she's creating strong new geometries and silhouettes, she seemed more comfortable with the second approach. Working partly with high-tech fabrics—one a taffeta, the other a metal material that takes the shape of the wearer's body—she crafted cocoons, straight-arrow shifts, and pantsuits. Standouts included an astrakhan ""cuddle"" coat with a satisfying heft; a softly sacked back; and big, buttery leather caplets with zippers that ran from the cuff to the shoulder. Another was a draped tartan dress to wear with riding boots on a drive upstate to Dia:Beacon. An art gallery is exactly the sort of place you'd want to wear one of these artful experiments in shape.</p></div>"
206,fall,2007,f2007,3-1-phillip-lim,"""Clothes people wear."" With that deceptively simple mantra as a guiding principle, Phillip Lim has built an impressive contemporary label that other aspiring young designers might be wise to study. Not only because he does a bang-up business, but specifically because he somehow succeeds in making clothes that look much more expensive than they actually are—not, as is too often the case, the other way around.</p><p>With <em>Grey Gardens</em>' Edie Bouvier Beale as inspiration—""pedigree minus prudence,"" Lim called it backstage—the designer showed his most ambitious collection by far. It opened with a prep schooler's bow-front shirt, plaid skirt, and double-breasted coat and it closed with an ivory debutante dress in laundered silk gazar. In between, Lim perfectly evoked the studied insouciance of the swish set with a short metallic shift over a fitted tee, a white boyfriend blazer worn with a strapless turquoise cocktail dress, and a tough leather jacket topping a pinafore. And even with all those layers, a head-to-toe look could still run less than a blouse on the designer floor.</p></div>"
207,fall,2007,f2007,6267,"The extent to which upscale American and British retailers are betting on 6267 as the great hope for Italian fashion's future could be gauged by the impressive lineup in the front row. ""We're here because they're the only young ones coming up, and people are talking about what they're doing at Malo,"" said one buyer. No one had exactly laid out the welcome mat for the audience, though. It was after 8:30 by the time everyone battled through two major door crushes, and polite expressions were wearing off.</p><p>To be fair to Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, the clothes on the runway weren't as shambolically amateurish as the hospitality arrangements. The collection was strong on coats, starting with an enveloping gray cashmere edge-to-edge wrap, and a camel man-tailored coat, seamed at the torso. The designers also came up with good showpieces at the end, like extra-chunky cable knits and a shaggy goat-hair chubby. But the middle of the show was too wobbly—it was derivative of Azzedine Alaïa in the sculpted, big-shouldered, tiny-waisted gray jackets, while the overcomplicated dresses read as a clumsy homage to everything Alber Elbaz had covered far more prettily last season.</p><p>Edited by world-class buyers, what 6267 has to offer might still respectably fill a niche. But to up their game, this pair needs to hire advice on presentation and making sure their identity comes through more strongly.</p></div>"
1,spring,2008,s2008,a-f-vandevorst,"Asking your audience to descend a steep, treacherous staircase in the main arena at the Palais Omnisports Paris Bercy in their stiletto heels is no way to endear yourself. But who were we to complain? An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx sent their models down those same stairs, with spotlights shining on them to boot.</p><p>The first group of girls wore clear plastic trenches and macs, some lined in nude jersey, others flashing the retro bras and hip-hugging briefs that are the Belgian duo's stock in trade. Lingerie touches were sprinkled throughout: Fine-gauge sweaters came with built-in bra cups, cowl-neck halter tops left the models' backs exposed. (There were also bustiers over puff-sleeve blouses, but these were comparative duds—bulky and hardly sexy.)</p><p>Some of the best pieces were tailored: boxy jackets with paillette-covered lapels, trim shirtdresses nipped at the waist with wide patent belts, and black or white button-downs worn with matching full trousers cropped above the ankle. As a contrast, there were also some of-the-moment draped jersey dresses, the prettiest in pale lemon yellow. It all added up to a strong collection for this husband-wife team… and we forgive them for the stairs.</p></div>"
2,spring,2008,s2008,abaete,"In her program notes, Laura Poretzky invoked the fashion mash-up of ""Miami Deco meets Gene Tierney."" It's a retro pairing that could very quickly turn campy, but it soon became clear that the many hours Poretzky has logged on chic beaches have not been in vain.</p><p>She merged the two elements into a fresh, uncluttered collection that could coherently take a girl from tropical boardwalk to city sidewalk. (And in the case of a couple of Deauville looks, onward to the Norman Riviera.) Color-block dresses in the sun-drenched hues of South Beach came in a candy-box assortment: There were flowing bohemian maxis, smartly tailored shifts, a sexy draped strapless number, and a fifties party frock.</p><p>High-waisted pinup bikinis didn't appear entirely seaworthy, but they were clean-lined enough not to fall into the dusty vintage trap. Other ideas—both good (a palm-print shirtdress) and bad (a perforated-leather sheath)—were scattered here and there, breaking up the slight monotony that was the only real fault of a collection with great commercial potential.</p></div>"
3,spring,2008,s2008,adam-lippes,"Witness the buffing and polishing of a young sportswear line: In August, Adam Lippes announced he'd be changing the name from Adam + Eve to the more user-friendly ADAM; this week came his first runway show, after three seasons of lower-key presentations; and later this fall, the doors to his first freestanding store, in New York's Meatpacking District, will swing wide.</p><p>And while the wheels of his business have been strategically churning away, Lippes has, of course, been at work designing Spring. He showed a relaxed easy-dressing collection in a scheme of mostly cream and beige shot through with bright color. Japanese influences were evident in the kimono sleeves and obi belts, while gestures in the direction of the Abstract Expressionist Morris Louis—colored stripes and the like—rounded out the agenda. Pairing breezy, to-the-floor dresses and wide-leg pants with chic flat sandals and gauzy head wraps, he set a laid-back tone sure to strike a chord among the contemporary Adams and Eves who buy his clothes. It was appealing and wearable—exactly what contemporary sportswear should shoot for. The hand-painted, striped knit pieces and the dégradé silk dresses will blow out of stores come spring.</p></div>"
4,spring,2008,s2008,adidas-by-stella-mccartney,"It was a very English scene at Stella McCartney's Adidas presentation: a local sports center under the Westway flyover, then a hall inside, turfed over like a provincial seaside park, with golf driving ranges and a mini-pool with a pink plastic raft floating in it and a fake flamingo on the side. There were models running around in long jersey shorts with rolled hems, shiny hoodies, and sheer white parkas, some others dangling their feet in the pool wearing black cutaway swimsuits, and the rest goofing around whacking golf balls in stone-colored Bermudas, T-shirts, and the odd belted jacket. As they were doing this, folks were milling about, drinking cocktails, listening to Ronnie Scott's house band, and watching Paul McCartney, Peter Blake, Justin de Villeneuve, and, randomly, Debbie Harry mill about, drinking their cocktails, too. Fun, if you were in a party mood, but it sort of sold McCartney's line short. This collection is one of the most functional, fully thought-out sportswear lines for women that exists—and certainly the best-looking. Had it been shown on athletes, it would have displayed the designer's competitive edge to better effect.</p></div>"
5,spring,2008,s2008,akris,"Albert Kriemler finds himself in a tricky position: As the creative force behind Akris, he dresses seriously chic women—Diane Sawyer, for one—in seriously chic clothes that are fashionable without being fashion-y. No small accomplishment. But he wants to be taken seriously as a designer, too, which means setting trends, not simply setting his focus on the timelessness of a well-cut suit.</p><p>He made a stab at it for Spring, using sailing as a leitmotif. The wooden runway, for starters, was made to resemble a high-tech yacht, and within this setting the designer loosely interpreted the sailor suit as a vertically striped sleeveless blouse worn with high-waist full-legged pants. Elsewhere, the maritime concept was given a full-on spin in tailored jackets with the squared-off back flaps of naval uniforms, and a two-piece dress stitched from strips of leather to resemble decking.</p><p>Unfortunately, the conceit often came across as contrived. A poppy-colored organza dress adorned with laser-cut square pennants was like a red flag: Danger! Kriemler would do better for himself and his customers by sticking to the sophistication for which Akris is known.</p></div>"
6,spring,2008,s2008,alberta-ferretti,"When there's any drift toward romance and softness in the air, Alberta Ferretti, Milan's queen of chiffon, is going to catch it one way or the other. This season, the way was quite lovely and not so obvious: Ferretti steered her collection in the direction of Greco-Roman imagery, all goddess drapery, toga-tunics, and mini gladiator skirts.</p><p>The show began with a T-shirt dress—a slightly asymmetrical cream jersey rectangle with a patch of oxidized crystal jeweling on one shoulder. It was an opening that heralded some good things in the way of subtlety and simplicity. Ferretti's palette, taken from the faded colors of ancient temples and frescoes, included verdigris greens, used to tint beautifully pleated dresses and floor-sweeping draped goddess gowns. The theme even managed to stretch to the house tailoring—jackets and coats were vertically pleated to echo Doric columns; shadowy bands of print inspired by Roman friezes edged a chiffon top. The most memorable looks, however, were the dresses that were unembellished, relying totally on draping for their desirability. The best was worn by Lily Donaldson, in cream jersey, which crossed in front and swooped and looped in the back: a quietly stunning entrance- and exit-maker par excellence.</p></div>"
7,spring,2008,s2008,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua said he'd been inspired by the Japanese photographer Araki, and we know what that means: ""art"" photos of bound girls in sleazy interiors, a lot of clear vinyl on cheap upholstery—that sort of thing. Maybe that makes it sound a bit too racy, though. This wasn't exactly a specialist erotica show, although plasticized transparencies, rubber embroideries, and lingerie details were worked alongside couture lace, tulle ruffles, and ostrich feathers. Though the show opened with three exits of bras, big panties, and organza boleros, it was, as always, essentially a dress collection, styled this time as a body-con take on the cheongsam-and-obi look. Oddly enough, it was the one random graphic white shift, with a Chinese neckline fastened with silver hooks and eyes, that drew the applause. Apart from that, the show didn't touch on anything Prada and Dolce &amp; Gabbana (or even Helmut Lang in his rubberized dress collection) didn't do ten or so years ago, but Dell'Acqua's fans are probably young enough to enjoy the revival—or simply to not give a damn.</p></div>"
8,spring,2008,s2008,alexander-mcqueen,"First, what must be said: Alexander McQueen's Spring collection was a tribute to the late Isabella Blow, the woman who discovered him, famously propelled his career from a student rack to a couture house, and faithfully wore his clothes—and Philip Treacy's hats—in their most extreme manifestations. Second, though: All terrible emotions apart, McQueen, like every other designer, can only be judged in the unsparing light of the general arena of fashion. To put it bluntly, this collection—after an off season last time—was going to stand or fall based on whether his clothes were any good.</p><p>It stood. McQueen mustered the clarity to dispense with smoke and mirrors and show his capabilities in cut, drape, and feathered flourish to an audience near enough to inspect every detail. He stepped up to the plate by running through all his archived knowledge—Savile Row tailoring in Prince of Wales menswear check jackets and strict, strong-shouldered suiting, combined with the legacy of his couture experience in fan-pleated chiffon, goddess-y drape, and hand-crafted drama. The theme of birds—particularly symbolic of Blow—held the show together through a reprise of all the highlights of McQueen's career. The molded-hip silhouette of a jacket and dusty, twisted georgette gowns came from his Barry Lyndon show; the floating bird-of-paradise prints, from his ""shipwreck"" season; the ombré-printed vast-shouldered kimonos, from his Japanese couture collection for Givenchy; the trapezoid shapes, transposed from the tricorne hats of his ""highwayman"" moment; the lace stockings, reprised from his <em>They Shoot Horses…</em> performance. And so on.</p><p>But this isn't really the point. McQueen has indulged in self-referential wallows in the past before, but this, for the most part, avoided that feeling. If some of his carapace-stiff shapes are as unviable as they ever were, the airy rainbow-bird-wing-printed pleating, an Art Nouveau-patterned blouse, and his romantic fairy-goddess chiffons put him back in the game of current trend (though they'd have been better without the fierce waist-cinching belts that looked like a hangover from winter). In all, McQueen honored his mentor by striving to bring out the best in himself.</p></div>"
9,spring,2008,s2008,alexander-wang,"When model Iekeliene Stange arrived at her Alexander Wang fitting the week before the show, the enchantingly off-kilter beauty walked up to a look intended for her and proclaimed it ""exactly what I want to wear."" For Wang, that moment is the fashion equivalent of a slam dunk. Simply put: The 23-year-old designer loves to make cool, chic clothes that cool, chic girls love to wear.</p><p>Wang said he had been thinking about the film <em>Working Girl</em> and Giorgio Armani's eighties-era power dressing. ""It's about a humble girl who came from nothing, making a living,"" he explained. But his real muse is his customer, particularly the insouciantly ultra-stylish being he calls the M.O.D. (Model Off-Duty). This time around that included the show's stylist, semiretired runway star Erin Wasson.</p><p>The result could best be described as a refined vision of what might happen if a pack of catwalkers plundered the career floors at Bloomingdale's circa 1987 and wove the loot into their own wardrobes. Naturally, it would mean looks like an oversized gray blazer with sleeves jammed up to the elbows over a wife-beater and shredded cutoffs, or a lace-trimmed bustier paired up with the trousers that once partnered with that aforementioned jacket. Beyond those easy-to-fathom ensembles were polished dresses cut in menswear wools and shirting along with casual wardrobe essentials, like the elusive just-right, thin heather-gray T-shirt and terrific, slouchy light denim jeans. These soon-to-be-staples made up for a few looks that should only ever be worn by professional mannequins.</p></div>"
10,spring,2008,s2008,alexandre-herchcovitch,"It's telling that Alexandre Herchcovitch's shows are blessedly free of the publicity-seeking D-list swarm and the accompanying camera-wielding circus. Instead, sneaking in just before the lights went down was a cooler sort of customer: It-model Agyness Deyn, who joined the MisShapes' Geordon Nicol and Leigh Lezark, the latter looking chic in the Brazilian designer's eyelet Tyvek dress from last Fall. Herchcovitch is one of the few remaining independent young talents in New York who still explores the sort of ideas that whet the arty appetites of the downtown set while maintaining a strong enough business to get his clothes onto boutique racks.</p><p>In a curiously dark (though stylish) turn for Spring, Herchcovitch trained his scissors on the tuxedo, carefully dismantling it and stripping it for parts. ""I want to transform the classic men's wardrobe, but in a very feminine way, forgetting about the clichés,"" said the designer backstage. It's a challenging agenda to set, considering that the masculine/feminine theme is well-trodden ground. But Herchcovitch managed an original take, splicing classic formalwear elements with punk details and flashes of crimson and chartreuse for added edge. It was best seen in tailored looks, such as a sleeveless waistcoat over a rolled-sleeve T-shirt and pegged pants, or a slouchy washed-silk tuxedo dress. These were miles ahead of the frothy, cummerbunded cocktail frocks that closed the show. They rounded out Herchcovitch's concept but probably won't make it into the closets of Lezark and company.</p></div>"
11,spring,2008,s2008,allegra-hicks,"""I'm here for the girlfriends. This is my block,"" said a PR girl at the door of Allegra Hicks' show. She was gesturing to a wide expanse of the seating, and it was full: India Hicks and her mother, Lady Pamela Hicks; Becca Cason Thrash; the Countess of Albemarle; Cosima von Bülow; Suzanne Kapoor; Andrea Dellal. They were there, of course, to support a dear friend, and maybe to shop for next summer's vacation wardrobe. For the press, opposite, it was a bit more puzzling. For apart from the people-noting (these ladies don't turn out just anywhere), it didn't seem like a fashion show at which it was possible to note much fashion going on. Allegra Hicks does caftans, full-length and short, of the kind that hit the high street two years ago—more expensive, maybe, but no news now. She also has a way with pretty leafy prints, summery high-waisted halters, jersey dresses, and then a couple of gowns, one in pale chiffon suspended from crossover spaghetti straps, another in liquid copper. Rather than make it an official on-schedule press show—at the end of a week in which there has been so much innovative design—she would probably do better next time to present her collection in a more private, at-home setting among her friends. That, or regroup and come back with a design statement that feels stronger than this.</p></div>"
12,spring,2008,s2008,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"She may have always worn her politics on her sleeve, but this season Vivienne Westwood wore her politics everywhere, distributing a manifesto along with bottles of her new perfume, Let It Rock. Portions of the manifesto were printed on bedsheet-size scarves that the models unfurled to reveal the designer's signature dresses, those of the deflated bosoms and exaggerated hips. The show, which was named 56 after the number of days the British Labour government proposes to hold terror suspects in jail without trial, was also ostensibly about an imaginary sex-filled marriage between Marilyn Monroe and an English lord—or so the program notes said.</p><p>That's a lot of meaning to jam into a collection, and, likewise, there were a lot of different, seemingly unrelated looks packed onto the runway. Cardigans were pulled on with buttons askew over unfastened dresses; jackets with portrait collars and puffed sleeves were worn with drop-crotch pants; and among Westwood's twisted ball gowns—and other greatest hits—were a holographic sequin dress with padding at the hips and bum, propaganda T-shirts over stuffed bras, and even a couple of beaded show-girl numbers with matching headpieces. A beautiful mess? For members of Westwood's tribe, yes. But to the uninitiated? It just looked nutty.</p></div>"
13,spring,2008,s2008,andrew-gn,"Some designers chase after cool; others are content to let the ladies come to them. And come they do to the Paris house of Andrew Gn. Inspired, he said, by the complete volumes of Buffon's <em>Histoire Naturelle</em>, he looked to flora and fauna to provide the luxe decorative motifs for his lunch suits, short cocktail numbers, and hostess gowns. White patent-leather butterfly appliqués appeared on a black linen dress with kimono sleeves, and embroidered black roses decorated a white linen coat with a Watteau back. The lilacs on an A-line coat-dress were so densely embroidered, they were a better-than-fair representation of the real three-dimensional thing. Such couture-grade handwork obviously doesn't come cheap, but then, his clients have deep pockets—and no inclination to hide the fact.</p><p>But it wasn't all embellishment all the time. Gn showed a new restraint in colorful silk dresses with little to distract from the flirtatious cut except frills of pleats around the armholes or lining the deep V-necks. Even more elegantly streamlined were the flowing one-shouldered silk dresses (one to the knee, the other floor length, both with floating back panels) that each came with a single black bow at the clavicle. The finale gown, white silk with long puffy sleeves and a black rose corsage at the cleavage, would make a lovely wedding dress. Looks like a new generation might come knocking.</p></div>"
14,spring,2008,s2008,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester, to the relief of her many followers, is by nature a trend refusenik. She carved out her aesthetic—that slouchy, layered, definitively Belgian thing—long ago, but still, there's always something subtly permeable about her parameters. This Spring, there's a floppy flowiness to her masculine-feminine design that picks up a sense of the thirties, and plays on bold stripes, fringing, feathers, and languid washed satin.</p><p>All this, of course, happens within the established template of Demeulemeester's tailoring—monochromatic soft linen coat jackets, elongated vests, and pants. This season, she's worked up a doable translation of a jodhpur and also turned her attention to the new wide-legged satin pajama trouser of the Marlene-gone-modern kind. Something of the glam, playful, and luxurious has even filtered in along the way. There are cock-feather borders on vests, a hint of showgirl razzmatazz in the fringed shorts and flapper shifts, and, if you look very closely among the multiple chains strung around the models' necks, a few transparent lockets filled with crystalline grains that are actually real diamonds—evidence of Demeulemeester's first foray into fine jewelry.</p></div>"
15,spring,2008,s2008,anna-molinari,"In the context of the somewhat hidebound system of seasonal trend chasing that beleaguers Italian fashion shows, Rossella Tarabini deserves more recognition for breaking free from constraints. ""I don't want to do a show just for the sake of it,"" she said. ""I've fought with myself to do something young women will really want to wear, that has consistency."" For the second season running, Tarabini followed her instinct for an edgier point of view at Anna Molinari. Instead of casting around for an overt change from Fall, the designer continued where she left off, working with short black-and-white striped knits, now layering in tiered schoolgirl box-pleat skirts and menswear-derived jackets and vests. That doesn't fit the mold of theme-led passages that used to prevail at this label, but it's a wise move. For the first time, Tarabini is giving the brand a chance to speak to a broader international twentysomething audience, and she should keep the resolve to develop it further.</p></div>"
16,spring,2008,s2008,anna-sui,"A fashion mash-up artist of boundless enthusiasm, Anna Sui picked Busby Berkeley musicals and Biba as her Spring influences. Mixed together, they produced one of her most dressed-up collections in seasons: all acid-bright sequins, neon prints, and silvery feathers. Adding to the fun was a chorus line of models in short punky wigs or Manic Panic streaks, wearing platform sandals à la Terry de Havilland.</p><p>The show began with high-waist shorts and a tie-front blouse topped by a net bolero that evoked Jean Harlow. Next was a glen-plaid jumpsuit worn with a matching jacket and a print top that was pure Barbara Hulanicki. An eclectic parade of nail-head embroidered boleros and bathing suits, color-blocked matte jersey frocks, and striped chiffon onesies followed. By the end there were showgirl dresses in mesh decorated with metallic paillettes and plumes. If the sheer numbers didn't seem very wearable, Sui balanced them with an extensive array of little silk shirtwaist dresses with puff sleeves and hems ending several sexy inches above the knee. How does it all fit in with the rest of the season? With the seventies quickly becoming a recurrent motif, Sui's show looked on the money.</p></div>"
17,spring,2008,s2008,anne-klein,"""My inspiration?"" mused Isabel Toledo after her sophomore outing at Anne Klein. ""A collaboration with a husband. A creative bouquet."" Indeed, the collection had many stories woven into it, including an ""Art Attack"" print inspired, Toledo said, by an incident in which her artist husband Ruben accidentally smeared a dress with paint. It also veered between classic Americana in the Anne Klein tradition—exemplified by a striped bathrobe dress, a knit tennis number, and the slightly fifties nipped-waist silhouette—and the more artful dressmaker look that characterizes Toledo's own line. Clearly, the balance between the two is still being worked out.</p><p>In the meantime, slick-as-oil lacquered-cotton pieces mingled with silver plissé separates, and transparent-pastel glazed raincoats topped hand-painted haute hippie broomstick dresses. The draped jersey dresses were standouts. If overall the collection was somewhat scattered, Toledo's pleasure in creation and materials was evident throughout.</p></div>"
18,spring,2008,s2008,anne-valerie-hash,"Hash just made the jump from couture week to the ready-to-wear schedule, and it was good timing on her part: The frilly, romantic things she does added another dimension to the pretty picture coming into focus for Spring.</p><p>The main idea here was to layer strapless dresses and jumpsuits over blouses. Sheer and in silvery shades of gray and pink, with high collars and puff sleeves, the tops gave her looks a demureness they might otherwise have lacked: No matter what kinds of embellishments they came with—and they came with plenty (braiding, pleats that zigzagged every which way, lace)—her frocks were seriously abbreviated.</p><p>In fact, it was easy to forget that Hash started her career picking apart and reconstructing menswear. Yes, some jumpsuits came with suit lapels, but she showed more bed jackets than blazers, and some of these were encrusted with rock crystal. Ironically, it was the organza dresses that hinted most at her background. They looked like nothing so much as jackets (or maybe crisp shirts) tossed on back-to-front, the collars draped elegantly across the bust, with the lapels meeting somewhere off-center in the rear. All in all, this was an interesting addition to the calendar.</p></div>"
19,spring,2008,s2008,antonio-berardi,"""It's much more minimal than last season,"" Berardi promised before his show. ""But there's still lots of work."" Inspired by a child's kimono, he said, he built the collection around squares and circular shapes. On the literal side, that made for silk kimono coats and jumpsuits. More abstractly, there were thirties-style bias dresses in blood-orange silk that came with round-peephole backs or trailed by long ovoid capes, and strictly cut jackets with geometric-paneled lapels and skirts with short, kicky hems.</p><p>The ""work"" he spoke of was evident in the bugle beading that made zigzag paths across dresses and tops—an artful play of matte and shine—and in the hammered chiffon that created subtle intarsias on the fronts and backs of tunics. The only missteps were a pair of sheer columns heavily embroidered with Swarovski crystals that dropped to the floor as the models tiptoed by, leaving a shimmering trail in their wake. (They tiptoed because of the unusual way Berardi's heel-less platform shoes were engineered.) But, fetish-y footwear aside, there were plenty of sexy-looking pieces here.</p></div>"
20,spring,2008,s2008,aquascutum,"""It's like a metamorphosis,"" said Michael Herz, pointing at the Polaroid lineup of the Spring collection he designed with Graeme Fidler. ""She starts off with the sober recognizable raincoat, and then gradually there starts to be color, and then she becomes a butterfly."" Well, not literally, but you could see his point. Following the slate gray mac, lovely dresses kept on emerging amid the more sensible tailoring. There were fitted shifts, one woven in painterly blues ""like a seascape,"" another in white organza with black cream and ivory appliqués. An asymmetric T-shirt dress introduced an easier, younger line, and then, at the end, hand-drawn fifties-style rose prints broke into full bloom. Charming, wantable, and very wearable.</p><p>The clever thing is that none of it looks weighed down by the idea of ""English heritage,"" which is one of the burdens that sometimes scuppers young designers charged to revive a classic brand. In its old sense, Aquascutum is a carapace that needs to be broken away from, though not entirely. What the Herz-Fidler team has decided to retrieve and update is the label's reputation for quality and workmanship, and in their hands, it's rich and quirkily done. Embroideries based on abstractions of the traditional paisley turn out to be made of silver hooks and eyes or stitched in multicolored strands of chiffon. Thanks to surprisingly luxe moments like this, plus the sense of youthfulness and ease they're now playing up, the pair is gaining confidence and respect. As Herz says, it's like a metamorphosis.</p></div>"
21,spring,2008,s2008,armand-basi-one,"One bellwether for the way things are blowing in London is the appearance on the official schedule of Armand Basi, out of Barcelona, Spain. The welcome mat has been rolled out not just because Basi is a successful 20-year-old family-owned knitwear business, but because the Londoner Markus Lupfer has been hired as its chief designer. For Lupfer, who closed his own label some time ago, it's a happy comeback. And for the Spanish brand, London is a stage from which to project its readiness for international action.</p><p>""There's no really big heritage, so they've let me find a look, and push it a little bit,"" said the German-born Lupfer, who had already test-driven the collection twice during Barcelona fashion week. Result: some experimental Japanese-via-the-eighties looks, a nice sense of color, and a bit of playtime nuttiness supplied by his housemate, the accessory designer Katie Hillier. Lupfer wove raffia through the show, principally in the fabrics, which had an airy structure, and more literally in the ""Mohawk"" heeled shoes, tutus, bags, bangles, and near-spherical pompom finale dresses. By the end, the audience was laughing—in a good way—which is quite an accolade for a show slotted for first-thing Sunday morning. Those who turned up got to show off about it to laggards all day long.</p></div>"
22,spring,2008,s2008,badgley-mischka,"The 1920's French Riviera of <em>Tender Is the Night</em> is friendly territory for Mark Badgley and James Mischka. The beads, the fringe, the Champagne-soaked nights—what better era to mine for the red-carpet dresses that have long been the duo's bread and butter? For Spring, they reinvented a drop-waist flapper dress in blush tulle and satin. In a more indirect reference to their inspiration, the designers studded the front of a plunge-back maillot and a halter-neck, sleeveless dress with crystals in a geometric, Art Deco style.</p><p>The seventies tailoring and structure of the Charlie girl are less familiar to Badgley and Mischka, who are still relatively new to the sportswear game. But, the pair said before their show, they were taken with ""the way that decade's clothes were put together and polished, yet didn't grab the body."" So they showed fluid suitings and jumpsuits in washed shantung and the maxidresses associated with the period in cotton gauze. A purple silk strappy dress, gathered and draped casually at the hips, was one of their strongest Me Decade riffs.</p><p>Altogether, though, these inspirations made for an unusual and sometimes jarring combination. Badgley and Mischka would do better for themselves to refine their message next time.</p></div>"
23,spring,2008,s2008,balenciaga,"""I'm exploring new territory, within the references of the house,"" said Nicolas Ghesquière before the show. ""I've done prints before, but I never went to the flowers."" So this was Balenciaga in full bloom: a splashy riot of hypergorgeous hydrangeas, pansies, peonies, daffodils, and anemones—some of them Cristobal's own—but compressed into another of Ghesquière's short-sharp revolutionary essays in couture technique.</p><p>The shapes, with their standout shoulder lines, hand-span waists, and belled (almost panniered) hip volume, marched in on vertiginous knee-high woven-leather gladiator boots. ""Instead of a put-together thing like last season, I wanted total looks—ensembles, as we say in French,"" Ghesquière explained, ""with graphic volumes like car bodywork. Sports cars!"" Each look came with its undulating folds sutured together with curvilinear topstitching, the sculptural surfaces backed with sports-derived foam, and the hems sliced short by a high-tech ultrasound machine. There were dresses and matching ""ensembles"" articulated as jackets over mini-pelmets, over tiny shorts.</p><p>But would this be wearable? What a silly question. If Ghesquière's extreme embroidered ""robot"" leggings can sell out for squillions of dollars apiece, and last season's jodhpurs, blazers, scarves, and ikat prints can fuel a global industry of knockoffs, what has he left to prove? By the time you read this, the flower-printing mills of the world will have been activated overnight. Even when Ghesquière turns to intensely rich, rarified ""explorations"" of detail—check the cloisonné bejeweled heels of those boots—there is something so relevant in the execution that it is capable of turning on the fashion fanatics to whom price is no object, while also sending the mass market into overdrive. In that way, Nicolas Ghesquière is one of the very few who can have his cake, sell it, and sit back and watch the rest of the market scramble for the crumbs.</p></div>"
24,spring,2008,s2008,balmain,"""It's a mix of Native Americans and India,"" said Christophe Decarnin before the Balmain show. ""It's also about freedom."" Jumping headlong into the season's nouveau boho trend, he opened with a strapless dress, its bodice densely beaded and its long, flowing skirts rendered in a soft, pastel floral shot through with gold Lurex. From there, Decarnin wandered through ponchos, one with a beaded eagle emblazoned on the chest, as well as sequined smocks and mirrored mosaic suede vests worn with slouchy tees and flaring jeans. He carried on into more familiar body-con territory, though even his signature hourglass dresses got the hippie treatment. Barely grazing the models' bums, they came in tie-dye, a feather print, or beaded macramé. Evident throughout was the designer's unbridled affection for embellishment. Confronted with an unadorned surface, he'll add studs, fringe, or lacing—anything to make his girls sparkle after dark. As one editor put it, should Roberto Cavalli's clients need a fix now that he's gone all gentle on them, Decarnin just might be their new man.</p></div>"
25,spring,2008,s2008,barbara-tfank,"Empty seats suggested that some invitees had found the early hour of this off-off-Bryant Park show, first thing Saturday morning at the Carlyle hotel, a tad uncivilized. But the scene in the Versailles Suite was, in fact, one of faultless propriety, with croissants and strong coffee served to longtime supporters.</p><p>A former costume designer with a husband who is a film professor, Tfank likes to mine cinema history, and this season she found her spark in the dark-eyed elegance of Anouk Aimée, darling of the 1960's art house, star of <em>Un Homme et Une Femme</em>. The designer's stock-in-trade is opulent French and Italian fabrics, often rich brocades, beautifully cut into soigné silhouettes that recall a time when the women who wore hats weren't Mischa Barton or Ashley Olsen. Tfank added fluid jersey dresses to the final cut for the first time; it would be nice to see more such experiments in the future. The hushed scene and the models' ladylike pace allowed viewers time to study points of interest. Many of these came as models strode away: the low, curved nape of a jacket; the Watteau back of a dress. Like a well-timed dose of espresso, a nearly fluorescent geranium pink added a welcome jolt of color to the genteel palette of icy pales.</p></div>"
26,spring,2008,s2008,bcbg-max-azria,"""We just decided to strip everything away,"" said Lubov Azria backstage after the BCBG Max Azria show. ""Last season was very dark, so we went toward the light.""</p><p>And so, out went the slightly witchy trappings of Fall, and in swept yard upon yard of airy organza, sheer tulle, and liquid jersey. The Azrias played with a familiar feminine dichotomy: the lady and the tramp. The former was a real grown-up in belted silhouettes—no infantile tent dresses here. She demurely kept her hems below the knee and often wielded an envelope clutch. The latter favored minidresses with bustier tops and flippy skirts (some veering dangerously close to lingerie territory) that nodded to the grand master of sexed-up fashion, Azzedine Alaïa. According to Mrs. Azria, customers will want to tag-team the looks depending on their varying moods. It's true enough that we dress to suit our mindsets each morning, but here the two extremes were a bit jarring.</p><p>The fresh new mood chez Azria did shine through in a palette of breezy pales and cool, washed neutrals. However, the show's grander themes of ""luminosity"" and ""layers of transparency"" at times got the best of them. It's safe to bet that a sheer, layered trench with printed patch pockets won't ever see the fluorescent light of a department store. Still, come spring there will be more than enough of the pretty dresses that are the collection's bread and butter to please its fans, no matter who they might want to be that day.</p></div>"
27,spring,2008,s2008,behnaz-sarafpour,"Can eco-friendly fashion be truly luxurious? That's the question Behnaz Sarafpour attempted to address in her Spring show, which included a capsule collection of limited-edition green looks that made use of organic fabrics and natural dyeing techniques.</p><p>To her credit, she did her best to chase any granola-and-hemp clichés away from the waffle-weave cotton that she printed with tropical palms and cut into dresses and coats. But their unpolished look indicated that the answer to the above question is: ""Maybe not this season."" The high-end customer doesn't want to sacrifice elegance in order to literally wear her good deeds on her sleeve.</p><p>Even beyond the green wares, the collection maintained a fresh-scrubbed, holistic vibe with crispy white cottons; coarsely textured rattans embellished with wood, turquoise, and coral beads; and leaf-print matelassé. Sarafpour ran the gamut with her many dresses but seemed bogged down in vintage silhouettes like the shirtwaist.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""nujzha""></div></div><p>More imaginative and modern were a pair of ombré pleated tank dresses.

28,spring,2008,s2008,benjamin-cho,"Ben Cho, a nerd? Mmm…not quite. But it was interesting to learn that he is ""really into nature and rock collecting."" That's not the first thing you'd expect to hear from a designer with such a cool following. (Today we spotted the MisShapes, Ryan McGinley, Chloë Sevigny, Jeffrey Deitch, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, who joshed about wanting to recruit their competitor to work for them.)</p><p>Spring was conceived as an extension of Fall. So last season's mirrored hearts and butterfly zippers were succeeded by a top in the shape of an orchid, and twisted ropes and geodes lashed to and suspended from garments. ""It's a basic idea I could have come up with when I was five years old,"" Cho told Style.com, ""but [until now] I never thought of making into something more beautiful.""</p><p>However, this <em>wunderkammer</em> of natural rarities was a bit too rarefied, the scope too limited. The silhouettes were mostly restricted to minidresses and narrow pants. Essentially, Cho's ""rolling stones"" were one-offs that probably would have been better served by an intimate showroom presentation than a full-on runway show—even if half of downtown did turn out to applaud.</p></div>"
29,spring,2008,s2008,berardi,"Antonio Berardi, a mountaineering and surfing guy? You wouldn't necessarily expect it from a designer known for his taste for the ornate, but those kind of active pursuits were the starting point for his secondary line this season. ""I'm in Tokyo a lot, where this collection is made, but it doesn't feel fresh there anymore,"" he said. ""What does is American sportswear, so I decided to do it in Japanese fabrics like treated papers and nylons."" Working with those materials, the kind that are designed to fold and pack away, and sticking to a cement-gray palette, Berardi sent out one sporty street coat after another—from a cropped windbreaker to a short trench to a parka cut full through the back like a cape. Underneath all of the great outerwear, there were drapey T-shirt dresses in fine cotton voiles. The outdoorsy vibe came across in indigo, acid yellow, and white tie-dye apron dresses, tank tops, and short skirts, as well as in a group of awkwardly stiff clear plastic coats and jackets. Strictly runway material, Berardi assured. There's a more supple plastic back in his Japanese factory. All in all, showing in New York seems to have given the European designer an energy boost.</p></div>"
30,spring,2008,s2008,betsey-johnson,"“Life is just a prom. No matter what she’s wearing, she can’t get out of her prom state of mind!” Thus did Betsey Johnson explain the giddy mindset of her quintessential “girl.”</p><p>The invitation featured Johnson’s own 1958 prom-night photo from Terryville High School in Connecticut, and the show was organized decade by decade, from the fifties (huge crinolines) through the sixties and seventies (Empire waists and daisies) to now. It consisted almost exclusively of petticoated party dresses dashed with decorations like sprinkles on a cupcake (sequins, hearts, laces, and lamé).</p><p>This was a deliberate act of indulgence. Johnson may have stores to fill, but most of the range didn’t come down the runway. A controlling interest in the company was sold to Castanea Partners just three weeks ago, and Johnson, never needing much of an excuse to kick up her heels, was in a real party mood. “We can get slammed,” she told Style.com, “but I have to do this show.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""emmu1a""></div></div><p>Held on the sixth anniversary of 9/11, it closed with looks representing the mood of the country today. There was a red-white-and-blue “Miss America” dress, and flowered headbands with paper flags stuck in them. For a surprise finale, four models came out and took off their shirts. Each had a letter on her back, together spelling out V-O-T-E.</p></div>"
31,spring,2008,s2008,bill-blass,"The revolving doors at Bill Blass haven't quite stopped spinning—although Peter Som has been named as Michael Vollbracht's successor, his first collection will be for pre-Fall. The clothes shown today at the Celeste Bartos Forum in the New York Public Library were the work of the design team of Prabal Gurung, Ana Carolina Coelho, and Tyler Rose. For this interim effort, the trio dug into the house's archives and honed in on the party dresses they found there. Some of the results simply looked liked dusted-off versions of the originals, while others—like a chiffon frock with embroidered scallops, a shantung gown with a sweetheart neckline, and a flounced-hem L.B.D.—had a bit more appeal. The stage is set for Som's entrance.</p></div>"
32,spring,2008,s2008,blumarine,"Anna Molinari designed her collection for a holiday in Saint-Tropez. But it's not the Brigitte Bardot-era Riviera we're taking about; it's the flashy twenty-first-century Med, complete with silk-and-lace nighties made almost plausible for the boardwalk with hip-slung belts and cropped leather jackets, the sleeves pushed up past the elbows…and midriff-baring waffle-knit polos…and micro shorts in neon brights…and cashmere or chenille track pants with sequined athletic stripes down the sides to go with matching embroidered tank tops. Track pants, of course—it takes hard work to get the body you need to wear revealing clothes like these.</p><p>Evening—often an opportunity for romance and ruffles at Blumarine—was racier still. Jersey goddess gowns with hip-high slits made those short shorts underneath a must. (The show's countless caftans and cover-ups in hothouse prints were a welcome note of modesty.) Were there any clothes for girls not on permanent vacation? Animal-spotted pony-hair jackets and A-line skirts, along with a few flower-print sweater dresses, ought to appeal to the city-bound Blumarine customer. But should she require something more than that, she might have to turn her eyes elsewhere next season.</p></div>"
33,spring,2008,s2008,bottega-veneta,"Tomas Maier's Bottega Veneta is one exemplary illustration of how the principles of restrained, minimalist, functionalist design—the discipline that's been cast into the shade since the nineties—can not only be relevant for now but, frankly, delicious with it. How so, when a collection is virtually colorless with no overt story to broadcast? It doesn't take a Ph.D. to analyze. Scan the section of flowy, crinkle-creased shirtdresses and goddess draping (how about the gray-green one with the crepe caught into a kind of garland in the neckline?), and you'd need a heart of stone not to think, <em>There goes something gorgeous</em>.</p><p>Backstage, Maier described the collection as a balance between ""rigor and anarchy,"" imagined along the attenuated lines of a Giacometti sculpture with a side thought for the attitude of Madame Grès, ""except loosened, and then I pinned and tucked the pleating on each girl irregularly, just where the body asks for it."" More importantly, as a Miami-dwelling world traveler, the German-born Maier understands summer dressing. He knows where his women are going in his clothes (airplane, work, dinner) and how to make such things as a spare shift or a pragmatic trench elegant. Maier's expertise as a swimwear designer also leads him to design from the inside out, so he will automatically—and considerately—build an invisible holding under-layer into his breezy transparencies. It's doable, believable, and, if you have the funds, eminently buyable. Credit Maier for the fact that the clothes are now vying with the accessories for attention in this luxury house founded on woven leather goods (for the update on those, check the wedges and the oxidized-leather belts and bags).</p></div>"
34,spring,2008,s2008,brian-reyes,"This was a generally unfocused Spring collection, unified only by some exciting texture and color combinations. Reyes showed a lot of leg—mostly with short dresses—on models with witty, Marge Simpson-esque updos. Hip-length coats with peaked shoulders looked (literally) square, nearly as wide as they were long. A chartreuse moiré strapless gown with a pieced skirt and haphazardly ruched bodice lacked the expert finishing it needed in order to work. On the brighter side were the designer's simple chemise dresses, one in a great nubbly plaid, and a shocking-pink silk dress that would do equally well for the office as for cocktails. And a red-carpet radical might want to scoop up the black column dress aflutter with head-to-toe chiffon tabs. Hopefully next season Reyes will continue to run free with fabrics while sharpening his overall theme and concentrating more on shape and construction.</p></div>"
35,spring,2008,s2008,bruce,"This was Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli's second season back on the runway after a three-year gap. Everybody loves a comeback; the challenge for the designers going forward will be to sustain the enthusiasm that greeted them last time out. How are their chances? Very good, from the looks of the little black dresses and casual-chic tailoring they showed today. Backstage the duo insisted, ""Our look is simple."" That's only partly right. There are no extra bells and whistles in Bruce's designs, but there are plenty of special details, the kind that cause the style cognoscenti to sit up and take notice—the razor-sharp knife pleating in the bodice of a strapless dress, the dense jet beading on a white silk top, and the ever-so-subtle padded shoulders that turned the otherwise straightforward sheath that opened the show into a power dress.</p><p>This season's standouts included a long jacket and a slim shin-grazing pencil skirt worn with an ikat-like print scarf, a shocking-pink cocktail dress with tiers of pressed ruffles on the bodice and a deep scoop back, and a plunge-front dress with an embroidered neckline. There were shades of the seventies in a washed-silk safari jacket and in an off-the-shoulder dress, but Gutierrez and Noselli had better success than most at making those classics look fresh and modern.</p></div>"
36,spring,2008,s2008,bruno-pieters,"One glance at Bruno Pieters' Spring collection and you can see why Hugo Boss hired the 30-year-old Belgian up-and-comer as the art director of Hugo, the company's most fashion-forward label. Pieters has an eye and hand for tailoring that takes his jackets, pants, and shirts beyond the mundane. Working along similar lines to Raf Simons at Jil Sander, he cropped his boleros right below the bust and layered them over short bustiers that exposed an expanse of jersey-covered midriff above hip-slung pants. A coincidence, surely, but one that worked to Pieters' advantage.</p><p>Amid the sharply cut denim anoraks, collarless coats, and a great short-sleeve tux, the designer threw in a pair of puff shoulder, drop-waist dresses, one white, one black, both sheer—a nod in the direction of the transparency motif that's been kicking around since New York. Also timely, playing as they did into the boudoir trend, were the beaded cummerbunds-cum-girdles that peeked out above the waistlines of shorts and pants. Tricky, over-styled accessories aside—at Hugo, Pieters will have to break the habit for such frivolities as sequined stirrup pants and opaque white tights—this collection showed quiet promise.</p></div>"
37,spring,2008,s2008,burberry-prorsum,"""She's a luxury warrior. It's a bit more rock,"" said Christopher Bailey, laughing. ""I've been listening to a lot of Deep Purple and Iron Maiden."" Well, you could feel the vibe. This was the sexiest version of Burberry yet, all ruched chiffon, leather belts studded with military medallions, and stacks of chain bracelets—an accurate riff on nineties body-con dressing and the stirrings of the heavy-metal revival that's coming out of London. In Bailey's hands, though, it scrubbed up remarkably. Never a down-and-dirty club kid, the designer knows how to pick his way through a theme at Burberry and play it to an international audience like a pro.</p><p>Essentially it was a collection of short, highly worked chiffon, tulle, and organdy dresses, under puffy peplumed jackets and an array of lightweight coats that ran from rockin' to super-rich. The house trench has segued into an ""armadillo"" hourglass silhouette with a built-up shoulder line of triple-layered storm flaps and pocket details to emphasize the hips. A butter-soft ivory leather coat came aerated with perforations, and a papery white coat was edged with thick crunchy bands of granulated beads. Somewhere along the way, the collection picked up a passing sense of the Tom Ford years at Gucci (where Bailey, remember, cut his teeth as a designer), or maybe of the high Versace times (a bright turquoise neoprene coat came with black crisscross lacing to nip the waist; a gunmetal coat was laden with a tracery of studs).</p><p>The point, though, is how easily it all separates out into pieces: pretty-edgy for those who like it that way, pretty-normal for others, with a slew of strong accessories as optional extras. That's Christopher Bailey's skill, and the essence of Burberry's ongoing success.</p></div>"
38,spring,2008,s2008,calvin-klein-collection,"Francisco Costa's strong Fall message meant expectations were high today at Calvin Klein. The collection began with an all-white passage: a lean, chalky jacket, bodysuit, and high-waisted skirt; a shift with nothing to interrupt its lines from shoulder to shin but the model's narrow curves. Slowly working color in, Costa showed a short-sleeve leather jacket decorated in a barely traceable graphite pattern with slim, tapering pants and followed that look with a gray wrap dress softly draped at the back. A trio of long T-shirt dresses with seamless shoulders in pretty, vivid shades of blue and green stood out, but Costa seemed to prefer neutrals. A bias-cut backless halter gown that closed the show was a shade of buff that barely registered.</p><p>Here and there, a curving seam interrupted the spare, clean canvas of these clothes, as did the extra panels on the fronts of the dresses. It wasn't enough, however, to alleviate the quiet repetitiveness of the collection as a whole. Yes, it was minimalist in the style of old-school Calvin, but there was a whiff of Raf Simons' Jil Sander here, too. Now that Costa has proven he has original ideas, we expect something more inventive from him.</p></div>"
39,spring,2008,s2008,carlos-miele,"Blame it on the bossa nova.</p><p>OK, forgive the cliché, but business is swinging cool for this Brazilian designer. Backstage, Miele energetically rattled off all the news: The first store for his second line, Miele, will open in Miami this December; there are plans for 20 more in the next year, including one on swank Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris; and the international ad campaign for his signature line will be shot by <em>Vanity Fair</em>'s fashion director, Michael Roberts.</p><p>Out on the runway it was a more serene scene. After last season's whirlwind runway tour of three cities (a slightly strange trip), Miele had found himself listening to Sinatra, from back in the days when Old Blue Eyes brought Brazilian jazz to world attention and introduced us to the Girl From You Know Where. And so Miele returned to his roots, to the warm colors and chill culture of his beloved country.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dkjr8p""></div></div><p>This time, Miele restrained himself a bit. It was a case of the same ingredients, but an improved recipe. Balance was the name of the game. Dresses that made ample use of the handworked pleating that Miele has long favored, produced in São Paolo's <em>favelas</em>, were unembellished. Grand gowns were quieted by a pale, pearly hue. And when he did use bright color, he held back on beading. Naturally, this being Miele, there were a few moments of overexuberance.… But, well, you know where to lay the blame for that.</p></div>"
40,spring,2008,s2008,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera said she was inspired by the watercolors of Jeremiah Goodman, the interiors illustrator to the smart set, whose book, <em>Jeremiah: A Romantic Vision</em>, was published earlier this year. Diana Vreeland, Elsa Peretti, and Pauline de Rothschild were his clients, so you can imagine how lavish Herrera's fabrics were today. And she wasn't content to leave her floral silk failles be; she'd decorated them with artful swaths of jet beads.</p><p>She set the refreshing new mood—last season, by contrast, she'd cited Edvard Munch—with the first look: a flower-embroidered white top with billowy black cocktail shorts. Moving on, there were shirtwaist dresses and cocktail styles topped with sporty cardigans; a new perspective on the suit with those shorts again; and one solitary pair of pants, shown with a vibrant floral silk tunic.</p><p>But Herrera's heart was in her eveningwear. An overlush gown or two could've benefited from a paring back, but there were stunners aplenty. A pool blue and green polka-dot silk chiffon dress stood out for its simplicity, a corseted gazar number with a ruffle at the knee for its grandeur. But a cream crinkle chiffon top and black dévoré ball skirt with a coral belt best captured the show's lighthearted yet still soigné look.</p></div>"
41,spring,2008,s2008,catherine-malandrino,"La Colombe d'Or, hidden in the cool hilltops above Nice, is one of Catherine Malandrino's favorite hotels. It's a famously charming spot, beloved by artists past and present, where you can sleep with a Modigliani above your head or eat wild mushrooms under a mural by Léger. It was there that she began to weave the story of her Spring show.</p><p>It's no surprise then that Malandrino returned in a big way to the craft touches with which she first made her name (she had shied away in the last couple of seasons). Organza was geometrically pleated or cut into trapunto scallops. Beading came in hefty grape clusters on necklines and sleeves. There was more texture in pointelle knits, embroidered boleros, and gowns in bright draped and pleated chiffon. It all got a bit much, actually, especially when you throw in massive blouson sleeves, voluminous palazzo pants, and linebacker shoulder ruffles.</p><p>The more literal art references, such as an organza blouson with a watercolor print, will likely have a hard time finding a customer. The art-meets-fashion gambit never fails to make for an interesting magazine item, but does a woman really want to wear a painting?</p></div>"
42,spring,2008,s2008,celine,"Ivana Omazic may finally have figured out how to rebrand a label that didn't have much of an identity to begin with: Keep it simple. In the past, she's resorted to various gimmicks—accessories overload, tiger prints, transparency (OK, she might've been onto something there). But for Spring, these were all swept away. In their place was an unfussy focus on cut and shape.</p><p>Her two motifs were whaleboning and crinolines, both given a high-tech, twenty-first-century spin. The first appeared on the outside of a deep V-neck dress, a zip-front jacket, and a T-shirt sweater, decorating and nipping the waist, and creating interesting yet subtle volumes at the upper back. The second, crinolines, gave undulating movement to swingy jersey skirts and dresses that would have otherwise hung flat. Silver necklaces that doubled as straps for maillots and dresses displayed a similar appreciation of a woman's contours.</p><p>If there's a caveat to Omazic's new, streamlined approach, it could be that it's too quiet for the competitive runways of Paris. Now that she's established a solid foundation, her next challenge will be to build on it.</p></div>"
43,spring,2008,s2008,chaiken,"""I'm a little obsessed with sand and sea,"" Julie Chaiken told Style.com. ""And that carried forward to a Mediterranean feeling.""</p><p>Though little-publicized, some behind-the-scenes changes have taken place at the company: The creative director, Jeff Mahshie, has left, and Julie took her bow solo this time. But Chaiken fans need not worry. While there wasn't much depth to the collection, it had plenty of charm.</p><p>The show got off on the right foot with a very simple, stark-white suit, designed for life under a blazing sun. Safari looks followed (belted jackets, rolled sleeves), and narrow silhouettes (straight skirts, tidy shifts) alternated with slithery draped dresses with names like Atlantis. Chaiken, based in San Francisco, enlivened her black-and-white palette with hits of pool blue and a bouncy wave print. ""The collection is a little bit younger and a little lighter, meaning less serious,"" she said. ""Being from the West Coast, I have to think of it as being for an American woman, rather than just a New Yorker.""</p></div>"
44,spring,2008,s2008,chanel,"Nuits d'Été, it was called, which gave some clue to at least a few of the dozen or so things that were going on at Chanel. <em>Summer Nights</em>, <em>Grease</em>, fifties Americana? Maybe that would explain the opening of blue-jean everything, from jackets to trenches, wide-leg jeans to dungarees, and, yes, bathing costumes—and then the parade of star prints and red-and-white striped jackets, and the Ronettes singing <em>Be My Baby</em> in the background. Really, though, it looked more as if Karl Lagerfeld had set off with a cry of ""Let's see how many trends of the season we can tick off this time.""</p><p>So, apart from the fifties, and the stripes and the stars (which have been shown elsewhere, but not in the flag sense), Lagerfeld checked off transparency, in the bottom half of organza evening looks; ran exhaustively through the all-in-one, from overalls to silk pajama types to teddies; and also touched on masculine-feminine tailoring, the big shoulder (with a new side-loaded epaulette), ballerina lengths, gold—oh, and soft, thirties circle cutting (actually, he was the first with that one, over at Fendi).</p><p>In other words, it was the regular Chanel ready-to-wear tsunami of style, strewn with a plethora of surface devices like grommets and portholes (in a bag) and loaded with pearls, chains, bows, bangles, buttons, and star-strung jewelry. Though it teetered on the brink of that other Parisian trend, randomness (the one Rei Kawakubo brought up at Comme), Lagerfeld kept the Chanel classics bobbing along on the surface as a lifeline to the elegance-seekers of the world. Some of the jackets—like the multilayered white chiffon—and the simple fitted dresses, with flattering circles of paillettes in the flanks, had the true stamp of the investment about them—the sort of dateless things that transcend any transient trend.</p></div>"
45,spring,2008,s2008,charles-nolan,"A boy-next-door type who designed for Anne Klein for a few years, Nolan was moved this season by the sunny travel illustrations first published by Miroslav Sasek in the sixties (<em>This Is Paris</em>, <em>This Is Edinburgh</em>, <em>This Is</em>…). He is also an ardent admirer of Claire McCardell, the godmother of clean-cut American sportswear. The collection, accordingly, had an innocent, Kennedy-era Camelot mood. It featured many sweet dresses and smart Jackie O. coats and ended with a very traditional bride.</p><p>There were some kitschy elements, like the plastic-gumball necklaces. And it was all a bit rah-rah at times: Many of the models were wholesome civilians (dancers from the American Ballet Theater, the designer¿s nieces, a human-rights lawyer); the emblem of a favorite charity was emblazoned on shorts and T-shirts; and every outfit was accessorized with a book. But it was also heartfelt, fun, and American as apple pie.</p></div>"
46,spring,2008,s2008,chloe,"After last season's vision of a hard-stomping girl on the Chloé runway, a slightly different spirit blew in for Spring. She made one of the season's more offbeat counterpoints to the pretty chiffon drift of fashion—it was romantic and layered, but with the retro-cuteness cauterized by an intrinsic graphic modernity. Paulo Melim Andersson's close-to-the-body, drop-waisted, flyaway patchworked dresses, which ran throughout his show, were partly abstracted, he said, from the idea of wind and sails (he's a keen sailor in his spare time.)</p><p>There was something fresh in the collection, which featured a lot of painterly prints that echoed Melim Andersson's previous tenure at Marni, as well as a few rare thoughts about how to make transparency passable on a daily basis. As diaphanous as the asymmetrically tucked dresses and tiny wrapped skirts may be at first sight, each one came with some kind of under- or over-piece to ameliorate exposure issues. The top pieces were long, sleeveless blazers (a Paris trend) or long-line knits, and the under-things were chiffon leggings or shorts.</p><p>If it wasn't perfect (there was a lot of repetition of that one combination of elements), by the end, there was certainly a clear image of what Chloé will be for summer. Better, there was also a sense in which this collection had reverted, in a contemporary way, to the old-time Chloé of the early seventies, when Karl Lagerfeld made it the go-to label for fashion-sensitive hippie girls. The fact that Melim Andersson managed to make this link, however tenuously, is a point in his favor. Though the memory of Phoebe Philo's recent successes at Chloé weighs heavily on his shoulders, this emerging young designer is right to start asserting a fresh point of view in his own way.</p></div>"
47,spring,2008,s2008,chris-benz,"""They made me wear a jacket,"" said Chris Benz at his presentation at the New York Yacht Club. He was explaining his outfit: a proper navy blazer, white shirt, and tie, teamed with not-so-proper frayed khakis cropped to the ankle, well-worn Chuck Taylors, and his multifarious wrist wrappings. As it turned out, he brought the same kind of engaging eclecticism to a sophomore effort that confirmed this young designer as a talent to watch.</p><p>This season's muse was a restless thirties starlet, stuck at her house in the Hollywood Hills and apparently amusing herself by trying on a closet brimming with clothes, hats, glasses, and jewelry.</p><p>The designer has a confident hand with color and it was shown to good effect in three chromatically arranged tableaux vivants. Though they ran the gamut from little ladylike silk jacquard suits to a denim jacket and striped V-neck pullover, most looks achieved what Benz calls ""the casual moment."" Tuxedo shirts were recast in chiffon with dropped shoulders and worn with soft wide-legged pants; a linen shirtdress had a similarly floppy ease. Wide-brimmed straw hats and beaded bracelets that mirrored Benz's own look cut through any leftover seriousness, as did terrific patent-and-mesh penny loafers from Christian Louboutin. Though the designer has heretofore been ""anti-gown,"" he added bright, bias-cut versions, including one in cotton jersey. His muse couldn't very well not have something to wear on the red carpet, could she?</p></div>"
48,spring,2008,s2008,christian-dior,"Christian Dior's 60th birthday celebration was a grand bouffée of such vast and extended proportions—couture at Versailles in July, resort in New York in August, a monumental Paris dinner in September—that the only place left to go had to be back down to earth. As a global behemoth, Dior does publicity like no one else (except its LVMH sister Louis Vuitton), and so, after all the heady image-making, a pragmatic payoff was obviously the plan for ready-to-wear.</p><p>Sting's <em>Englishman in New York</em> set the theme (he was there in the audience, too) for a light, nonintellectual revival of all the patterns John Galliano has amassed through his ten-year career at Dior. Under the guise of twenties-through-forties styling, he brought back his pantsuits as pinstripe three-pieces and Marlene Dietrich white-tie tailcoats, reprised the pagoda-shouldered silhouettes of his Madame Butterfly collection, and, of course, laid on a rendering of his signature bias cutting in jazz-age chiffon and thirties charmeuse.</p><p>Is Galliano at his happiest when discharging such commercial duties? In the past, it's grated on him, but this wasn't one of his camp-hysteria evasions, nor was it one of his more passive-aggressive collections of bottom-line merchandise. There were pretty, accessible things: palest dusty <em>eau-de-nil</em> chiffons, a sugar-pink, silver-embroidered evening jacket with a sinuous, traily skirt, and a knowing nod to the current feel for pajama dressing. Oh, and handbags. In one sense, the show made an unexceptionable job of broadcasting what Christian Dior stands for in reality through the many markets it has conquered—it was a counterweight to the high-flown flourishes of earlier this year. In another, it missed the flair and humor Galliano can muster at his best. If there was any lingering hint of ennui in Sting's insistent refrain of ""I'm an alien"" (Galliano is a great one for sending aural messages), it didn't extend to the designer's frankly hilarious finale pose as a cigarette-smoking Englishman, caught in top hat, tails, voluminous white underpants, and a pair of suspendered socks.</p></div>"
49,spring,2008,s2008,christian-lacroix,"In a season when fashion has suddenly woken up to embrace all the possibilites of the palette, you'd expect something extra special from a dab hand with color like Christian Lacroix. As always, he did play with print—with pink and black splotches on organza ruffled dresses, with lemon and black speckles on waffled silk chintz, bursts of spray-painted watercolor and schematic sixties patterns flowing over beach cover-ups. As a total look, though, it never quite went as bonkers as you wanted. It was—what? A touch forties, with some big-skirted dresses and slick, exaggerated trenches; a bit sixties, with neat little coats; and then nonspecifically contemporary with blousons and beachwear.</p><p>Some of these pieces carried the flavor of Lacroix—no one else could be the author of that puffy buttercup yellow dress with a black bow—but as a collection, it lacked the coherence and vibrancy that zing out of his couture shows season after season. And that's a pity, because at a moment like this, it would have been good to see Lacroix pushing his advantage as a grand master of exuberance as far as it could go.</p></div>"
50,spring,2008,s2008,christopher-kane,"If Christopher Kane and his big sister Tammy hadn't had a bad babysitter in the eighties, their Spring collection might have looked very different. ""It was the pair of us sitting on the sofa watching late-night horror films like <em>Carrie,</em>"" said Kane. ""And <em>Crocodile Dundee</em>."" The two movies set him off thinking about chiffon and eerie suspended ruffles on the one hand, washed-out denim and snakeskin vests on the other. Then he bought a camouflage T-shirt on Dalston market. And because it was summer, Tammy was working in a giant £5 T-shirt dress from Primark. And so it went.</p><p>All these domestic details are material to the development of one of the most-watched young designers in the world. The Kane siblings work so closely their thought processes are virtually indivisible, to the point that the models in the show with their long, straight hair are dopplegängers for Tammy. Together, the duo can reinforce an odd combination of ideas until they walk the line between trashy and internationally elegant. One slip, though, and it'd be over.</p><p>This time, the snakeskin prints, western shirts, and stonewashed denims flirted with what Christopher calls the ""dodge"" side, but it was the loosened, floaty nature of the silhouettes that caused more surprise. Instead of thigh-grazing, body-gripping shapes, there were flyaway chiffon ruffles, some in Christopher's camouflage print, as well as slouchy T-shirting pieces developed from Tammy's work dress. After many reiterations that included a beautiful long white dress with ruffles banded in snake, their casual-western-romantic message had fully registered. As the VIP audience left the building, the noise of discussion was deafening: Is this collection a watershed in the mood of fashion? Will Kane confuse customers by moving on so quickly, or is he smart to outpace his copyists? Will the chiffon mills of Italy go into overdrive overnight? Quite possibly, the answer to all these questions is yes.</p></div>"
51,spring,2008,s2008,collette-dinnigan,"This should be Collette Dinnigan's season. After all, the Australian designer made her name with lingerie dressing, putting Hollywood in her lace-edged slipdresses. But the boudoir theme that's become so relevant here in Europe eluded her. Instead, she sent out a pretty, but for the most part unremarkable, assortment of dresses that did little to establish her point of view. They came short and long, in metallic lamés, delicate lace, abstract silk florals, and bold solids. The one-shoulder, nipped-waist silhouette that we're seeing everywhere for Spring dominated, but there were also sixties-style shifts and baby dolls with tiers of ruffles falling to the knee. Many necklines and waists were embellished with silvery sequins or crystals.</p><p>Breaking up all the repetition were off-the-shoulder asymmetrical blouses worn with high-waisted palazzo pants or short shorts, plus a few sporty looks like zip-front cardigans and hoodies. Does Dinnigan, who was on the runway for the second time after a comeback last season, have the goods to compete on the Paris stage? Not yet, and not unless she returns with a collection that has some actual fashion in it.</p></div>"
52,spring,2008,s2008,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo is one of the very few living designers who can command the rapt attention—even the adoration—of the inner fashion crowd by doing something deliberately demented on a runway. To describe: A projection of naïve anime cartoons was playing on the floor; a jerky soundtrack of circus whizbangs, rock 'n' roll, the theme from the James Bond films, and traditional Japanese tunes filled the air. Then a girl walked out, made up like a clown, in a pink patchwork pantsuit apparently created from square, synthetic ruffle-edged drink coasters. There followed a bewildering mash-up of layers: coats printed with African hairstyle ads, vertically sliced half-jackets, dippy skirts with knotted rags tied to the hems, drawstringed sweat pieces, frothy nylon tutus patched to the front of pencil skirts, petaled T-shirts, menswear tailoring, fragments of magicians' sparkly capes, and frilly bloomers dangling from ruffled ribbons.</p><p>How to make sense of this? Don't try: The madness was the message. ""Clusters."" ""Randomness."" ""Cacophony."" These were the words Kawakubo used to explain her inspiration, and then, of course, it all fell into place as a figurative observation of the state of modern urban consciousness. It was suddenly easy to imagine Kawakubo walking to work in the center of Tokyo, taking off her mental filters and letting in all the noise, clashing color, and fragmentary simultaneous imagery of the city crowd. Doubtless, within all this there are near-sane simple pieces Kawakubo will fill her stores with, and sell, too. But that was not the point the happy-looking crowd left the building discussing—rather it was the fact that, though many may emulate her, there is no one to touch the free-thinking experimentalism Kawakubo can bestow on fashion.</p></div>"
53,spring,2008,s2008,costello-tagliapietra,"You don't come here expecting the reinvention of the wheel. You come to see how Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra have tweaked their template.</p><p>This season, the Brooklyn boys placed less emphasis on seventies swagger and went for something more soigné. The collection again clearly referenced the past—there was a taste of thirties languor, and the hair could have been taken from an Edwardian china doll—but it wasn't mired in it.</p><p>Backstage after the show, the designers talked about the specifics of their rather esoteric inspirations: the ""reductive"" portraits of the Finnish painter Helene Schjerfbeck and twenties fashion illustrations by the Viennese artist Ernst Dryden. ""We concentrate on subtleties, and build upon our design vocabulary,"" Costello said. ""We're doing something that's personal to us."" The elegance of Dryden, to give a nuanced example, could be picked out in a black lace dress tied low on the waist, and in a dove-colored number with a pink decorative swag at the hip. For designers who've made their name working with jersey (so notoriously hard to master), it's all about finesse.</p></div>"
54,spring,2008,s2008,costume-national,"It's always a bit of challenge for Ennio Capasa when fashion moves in a romantic direction, as it's doing right now. The designer, who is making a point of celebrating his 21st anniversary in business this year (why 21, exactly? It¿s a lucky number, he says), is at his best when he's working along sharp, sexy lines.</p><p>For Spring, he tried to resolve his dilemma by going Goa: ""A cool and chic traveler after a long journey to India returns home,"" read the show notes. Instead of attempting clothes for her voyage, though, Capasa smartly set about designing for her life after the trip was over. These were pieces aimed at urban sophisticates, though touched by light strokes <em>à l'indienne</em>, i.e., rich jewel tones (persimmon and hot pink, Vreeland's ""navy blue of India"") and softened shapes. A khaki suit with long flared pants came piped at the waist with two stripes of citrine, a short coat borrowed sporty details from mountain anoraks (her subcontinental sojourn included a trek through the Himalayas), and dresses were wrapped and draped from one shoulder in the style of saris.</p><p>The sheer fabrics present Capasa with the same problem other designers are facing this season: Back home in the real world, there's little room for transparency on city sidewalks and in office elevators. But an amethyst silk dress sashed at the waist and cut short above the knee would make a fine addition to a downtown girl's closet long after the scent of sandalwood has faded.</p></div>"
55,spring,2008,s2008,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley turned to seventies France for inspiration this Spring, conjuring a sporty but stylish tomboy. Of course, you can't talk about fashion of that particular decade and provenance without mentioning Yves Saint Laurent, and sure enough Rowley did: The second look down her runway was a cream suit with a long, lean jacket swinging open over slouchy trousers, a softer version of Le Smoking. It set the tone for a collection that also included long, narrow, and breezy silk dresses slit to the hip, and some lean fine knits, cinched at the waist and reaching to the knee. For the most part, Rowley mined this vein of <em>sportif</em> chic effectively, though she would have done well to eliminate some of the clutter. Piles of enamel jewelry in pastel tones and misplaced scarves and belts confused the message and weakened the overall look.</p></div>"
56,spring,2008,s2008,d-g,"From the first look, a cream-colored trapeze peasant dress with gold lace at the hip-high hem, it was clear that Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana would be exploring their hippie sides for Spring (the piles of black-and-white TVs that flashed D&amp;G ads at the back of the runway and Michael Jackson's <em>Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough</em> on the soundtrack notwithstanding). The show's arts-and-crafts-y theme came across in patchwork denims, a short shift appliquéd all over with silk flowers, and a finale of floral-print smocks, caftans, and tent dresses.</p><p>This being D&amp;G, there was a fair amount of glam stuff, too: bronze croc-look lamé jackets and minis, flared pants studded with gold and crystal, and borrowed-from-the-boudoir nude-and-fuchsia chiffon dresses. But all this was cut with nouveau-preppy chambray button-downs and cuff shorts, belted fine-gauge cardigans, of-the-moment wide-leg jeans, and even a photo-print of a horsey Fair Isle sweater. If it sounds like a mad mix, it was—but one in keeping with the season's boho seventies leanings. What's more, it was a surprisingly fresh hit of sweetness from a brand that has sometimes ventured too far into sexpot territory in the past.</p></div>"
57,spring,2008,s2008,daks-by-giles-deacon,"Showing in the last gasp of Milan fashion week—to many empty front-row seats—Giles Deacon sent out his second collection for the English heritage brand Daks. He said he was inspired by watching a manga film, <em>They Kill Elves</em>, and listening to Philip Glass: What emerged was a sort of twisted romantic take on an English garden party. If that sounds sinister, not to worry. This was a typical Deacon lineup of dresses treated to a lot of creative prints and textures that managed to pick up on two of the trends of the week: fifties dance dresses and the seventies (check his orange-spotted puff-sleeved opener). In an odd way, though, it was the nonconformers that were most memorable—say the silk shirtdress, or a Peter Pan-collared coat in a pink/silver cloque, charmingly fastened with black tulle buttons. In all, this was yet another iteration of Deacon's idiosyncratic talent for one-offs, the sort that make a nice surprise to run across while browsing aimlessly in a store. Would it make a destination area, with a distinctive brand identity, though? Can one spontaneously finish the sentence, ""Daks is about…""? In all fairness, not yet. This one is a work in progress.</p></div>"
58,spring,2008,s2008,danielle-scutt,"She's a twenty-first-century female gladiator of the lost tribe of Glamazonia, battling for supremacy against a pride of lions. As over-the-top as it sounds, that's a bit of what Danielle Scutt seems to be about, if we're to judge from the uncompromisingly fierce collection she sent out in her first solo runway show. In fact, her neo-feminist power vixens in their patent bondage-strapped animal prints aren't really debutantes. Scutt has shown twice with Fashion East, and some of her signatures, like her red-hot touch with denim, are becoming recognizable.</p><p>Her most salable pieces are short knife-pleat denim skirts and the high-waisted, fifties-inflected jeans she's been working on since she left Central Saint Martins. Other dresses in variations on zebra stripes look destined for plenty of magazine editorial shoots. Scutt still has a way to go with her edit, though. Short and sweet is probably not quite the right motto to recommend to a kick-ass designer, but anyway, some advice: She needn't have killed herself to put out quite so much in the way of swimwear and commercial pieces.</p></div>"
59,spring,2008,s2008,daryl-k,"Full of relaxed, sporty pieces, Daryl Kerrigan's Spring collection struck the right chord between pretty and tough. She opted for a low-key, intimate presentation and sent her models out two by two in complementary outfits to afford the audience the opportunity to get a good look at the clothes.</p><p>Kerrigan fans might want to break out the ThighMaster before Spring: The designer showed a lot of short dresses, most of them in a 1960's shift shape—wider on top, narrowing toward the bottom, with room around the arms in a cropped dolman sleeve. There were chambray day dresses with delicately studded self-covered belts and new-wave asymmetrical snap closures; silk shirtdresses with attitude in red, black, and light gray; great layering tees; and gauzy silk tops with room to spare.</p><p>The most interesting pieces were the more fitted jersey ones, with subtle monochrome paneling shaped to articulate the muscle groups beneath the fabric. ""I was thinking of a body consciousness, but not in an obvious way,"" the designer said. Effect achieved.</p></div>"
60,spring,2008,s2008,derek-lam,"A child of the seventies, Derek Lam is at his best when he's reimagining the Me Decade. Before his show, the designer explained he was inspired by the late photographer Guy Bourdin. ""I've always loved his work,"" Lam said. ""He's the other side of Helmut Newton—young and fresh and provocative."" Lam's show was all those things, from the first gray-tone leopard-print silk romper to the final look, a louche gold sequin robe. By day, there were mid-calf dresses with V-necks in bold green and red raw silk; and, on the tailored side, a swingy coat-dress with bell sleeves and a double row of gold buttons, or a navy blazer that was all sharp angles worn over a little one-piece.</p><p>After dark, out came the zebra prints and an allover-beaded sheath that had the look of stained glass without any of its holy connotations. But what this show will be remembered for, not least because come springtime you'll see bright young things all over town sporting them, were the little silk georgette evening dresses. Lam cut them short, with tiny handkerchief sleeves and delicate pintucks at the chest, and showed them with sexy black back-seam stockings. Bourdin would approve.</p></div>"
61,spring,2008,s2008,derercuny,"The Derercuny program notes explained that designer Mina Lee had ""embraced geometry as the inspiration of a sensual and refined femininity."" Loosely translated, that meant she used large origami-like crowns as decoration on her dresses and jackets. Fair enough. Even Dolce &amp; Gabbana embraced artfulness this season, and origami has certainly been in the air. But Lee's theme eventually got the better of her. The streamers of bow-tied ribbons that decorated some pieces, waist to hemline, or that functioned as underskirts or as scarves, were rather cloying. Ditto the oversize petal-like appendages on a trapeze dress. It's too bad, because there were things here to like: an easy, short, boxy black and green color-blocked slipdress; an L.B.D. with a mini capelet that tied in the middle of the chest, creating a neat, nipped silhouette; or a creamy lace bib-front blouse worn with pants that had a subtle jodhpur flair to them.</p><p>Lee's sophomore effort didn't pull in as many curiosity seekers as her runway debut did last season. Of course, showing on the morning after Versace unofficially closed the Milan season didn't help. But to hold on to the believers who did show up, she may want to temper her urge to overembellish and instead let her eye for cut and line speak for itself.</p></div>"
62,spring,2008,s2008,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg is nothing if not a savvy businesswoman, but for Spring she had pleasure in mind. She dubbed her show <em>Under the Volcano</em> and in her program notes said it was about ""the fantasy of escaping to exotic islands, and the wilder shores of love."" And why not? Every working girl needs a vacation—and a vacation wardrobe. That's exactly what von Furstenberg delivered, to the exclusion of much else. There were T-shirts and wrap skirts in an oversize abstract butterfly print, a sack dress beaded with beach glass at the neckline, a tent gown in sunset hues, and a plunge-front maillot for good measure. In keeping with the escapist theme, Spring was an explosion of color and pattern.</p><p>But should her fans need to take a meeting, she did offer a few suits, although they were hardly of the pinstripe variety. One short-sleeved white linen safari jacket was paired with full trousers, and another in a raucous print on raw silk came with a matching full skirt. If you have to be in the boardroom, von Furstenberg seemed to be saying, you may as well be the center of attention.</p></div>"
63,spring,2008,s2008,dkny,"Donna Karan has perfected her presentation format for DKNY. It was, again, a casual, standing-room-only affair with the show repeating a few times on a loop so viewers could meander in and out. The wide-open doorway of the Stephan Weiss Studio let the crowd filter onto the corner of Charles and Greenwich streets, essentially connecting runway to sidewalk. ""It's about the modernity of New York—all the new buildings and the freshness of the city,"" Karan said with characteristic enthusiasm.</p><p>With floppy Jodie Foster-in-<em>Taxi Driver</em> hats and Feist's cover of the Bee Gees' <em>Inside and Out</em> as the soundtrack, the show was right in step with the 1970's resurgence that was in early infancy last season and is now learning to walk. Much was long and lean: color-block jersey gowns with a hint of Halston about them, skinny shirts tucked into wide-legged pants or dark jeans, and a retake of the Bianca Jagger white three-piece suit. Everything was quite polished, from boxy coats to sash-belted silk dresses.</p><p>As a secondary line, DKNY, almost by definition, needs to project a young, upbeat energy, and the proceedings—with the exception of a few overly splashy prints that dragged back the pace—had plenty of bounce. The cherry on top of this seventies sundae was, naturally, the jumpsuit. It's a trend Karan hopes will have legs. ""My life is in a jumpsuit,"" she said. ""So I'm glad it's back. To me, it's an icon.""</p></div>"
64,spring,2008,s2008,dolce-gabbana,"There's something fabulous about the energy of a Dolce &amp; Gabbana show when they let loose their bouncy, celebratory Italianate love of women and fashion. For Spring, they recaptured that freshness in a virtuoso performance that showed them at their very best: blowing modernity into fifties romance and loading their unique culture into accessible clothing.</p><p>It was their starting point that let in the air: the idea of freehand painting, which they introduced in a video of young artists splashing broad brush streaks and flowers on bolts of fabric. The designers had been set off, they said, by seeing Julian Schnabel's work in the baroque-contemporary setting of the Gramercy Park Hotel. Back in Milan, they took it further, starting with pale brushstrokes on parchment canvas, cut into an opening sequence of crinolined dresses, caban coats, and a great reiteration of their signature flared trousers. From there, the show became ever more confident, drawing on the cache of experience the duo have stored up over years: It had corseting, inserted into some beautiful covered-up shift dresses; tailoring, seen in oversize brocade tux jackets; and jewel-colored Venetian cut velvets covered with a veiling of tulle. By the end, Dolce &amp; Gabbana had ticked all the boxes of trend—transparency, fairylike silhouettes, a nod to the seventies, and a grand finale of painted organza fifties-fantasy ball gowns—without wavering from their own heartland for a second. Bravo.</p></div>"
65,spring,2008,s2008,donna-karan,"Donna Karan worked both sides of the structure/flow divide in her Spring collection. Picking up on the current trend for tailoring, she showed short-sleeve jackets with portrait collars, pairing them with slim skirts that dipped below the knee. The effect: a more feminine take on the power suit. A harder sell for the boardroom, though, were the full skirts she dubbed ""parasols"" (the term gives a good idea of their girth). Back on the crisp, breezy side of things were a blouse and short A-line skirt in denim, as well as shirtdresses in caramel waxed cotton or indigo linen, and a pretty red strapless dress, one of the show's few shots of color.</p><p>These were juxtaposed with Karan's signature soft, stretch jerseys, most often in pale shades of nude but also in chalky white and silver gray. They crisscrossed at the neck, wrapped around the torso, and grazed the tops of her sculpted wood mules, and the best of them exuded the kind of confident sensuality you associate with a woman like Kelly Lynch, who sat next to Demi Moore in the front row. Whether the silhouette was lean and languid or full, belts played a central role, coming in raffia and leather or lace. An artisanal motif materialized in floral appliqués, in a hem of cork at the bottom of an organza skirt, and in tulle densely embroidered with arabesques of silk ribbon. Out of place, they were slipups in an otherwise urbane show.</p></div>"
66,spring,2008,s2008,doo-ri,"If Doo-Ri Chung isn't this year's news—she'll pass the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund mantle to a new winner in two months—she isn't about to fade quietly into obscurity, either. Continuing to push beyond her ""jersey girl"" beginnings, she showed a strong Spring collection that balanced her proven draping skills with razor-sharp, yet still feminine, tailoring. Banded, high-waisted pants full through the leg were key to the sophisticated mood. She paired them with an organza blouse over a knit bustier or, more simply, an asymmetrical top. Ivory jacquard shorts in the same torso-hugging silhouette were teamed with a deep navy shirt with delicate mesh at the shoulders.</p><p>For evening, there was more of that netting, encasing entire dresses or covering a crystal-studded bodice or hem. It seemed like Chung was experimenting with ideas of positive and negative space, but some of the nipped-waist cocktail dresses came off as over-thought and overworked. The most compelling pieces were the most spare: a sleeveless and boxy black-silk pajama top with sheer overlays, worn with the briefest of walking shorts; a lavender organza shirt with princess sleeves worn with a full knit skirt. The satin organza gowns with which Doo.Ri closed the show suggest there may just be a minimalist underneath all those other extras.</p></div>"
67,spring,2008,s2008,douglas-hannant,"""Maybe I can¿t bring you to the Mediterranean, but I can bring you to the Hudson River,"" quipped Hannant (recently back from Caracas, Venezuela). While his devoted followers—including Ivana Trump, Valesca Guerrand-Hermès, Jamee Gregory, and Olivia Palermo—gathered under a tent on the roof of the Hudson Hotel, the designer's ship sailed almost an hour late. But the clothes, for the most part, were worth the wait.</p><p>The collection tacked between silhouettes close to the body and looser ones (some of which, unfortunately, jibed into tent territory). He translated the patterns of Portuguese tiles into prints and embroidery patterns; Elizabeth Taylor in <em>Boom!</em> inspired a chic caftan. Paper-bag waists and balloon shapes weren¿t exactly news-making, but what Hannant called his ""ghosted"" pieces, with a sheer print floated over a solid version, succeeded in creating the light, wafting effect he was after—as did two short and surprisingly youthful summer-white dresses in eyelet and guipure lace.</p></div>"
68,spring,2008,s2008,dries-van-noten,"As the audience groped its way into a dark basement, it feared the worst. Could Dries still be in his somber winter fugue? No: After the first girl walked out in a flowered halter and a pair of contrasting pants, the runway gradually came alive with color, pattern, and easy shapes, and an almost audible sigh of relief ran through the room. This was Van Noten back on home ground, taking summer's license to run wild with florals while also capturing everything his devotees adore about the arty/ethnic cast of his clothes. ""I worked on printing several different patterns on one piece of material,"" he explained, ""so that you can end up wearing four or five prints in just a couple of pieces.""</p><p>It takes a particular talent to mix color and print without making things too busy to deal with. Always essentially a reality-based designer, Van Noten made it all seem simple—and even, for him, a touch chic. He dealt out a kaleidoscope of painterly and fifties-derived florals and abstract leafy strokes in greens, blues, yellows, and saffrons. Deep bands of contrasting color turned up in the hems and yokes of dresses, classic scarf prints were transformed into silk pants, and little cuffed linen shorts came printed with tiny fifties flowers. The total impression was fresh but also, in the end, surprisingly sophisticated. The high-heeled shoes—fabric pumps and vertiginous multi-patchworked sandals—took the collection a distinct step away from boho hippie on holiday and into the zone of city dressing. And where Van Noten deployed lashings of semiprecious-stone necklaces and his signature metallic Indian embroidery, it suddenly became an inspiring vision of alternative luxe for day.</p></div>"
69,spring,2008,s2008,dsquared,"The Dsquared² show started with the sound of an engine revving up. A curtain parted and out came an American muscle car driven by a bare-chested young man. In the backseat was the pop sensation Rihanna, she of the catchy summer hit <em>Umbrella</em>. After a pass or two around her ride and a final toss of the keys to her buff chauffeur, she took to the runway for a very believable turn as a top model, getting plenty of mileage out of a black slip that revealed her toned legs and cantilevered her twin V8s up toward her clavicles.</p><p>It was a lot of skin for a 9 a.m. show, but as far as a Dan and Dean Caten affair goes, it was pretty standard stuff—and relatively toned down, after last season's construction-worker romp. Beyond the body-shop props, the twins' theme, loosely, was party girls and the grease monkeys who love them. Hence the crystal-encrusted necklines on short halter dresses, the sheer caftans accessorized with a brandished cigarette, and the cutout jersey dresses so revealing that the models tugged at them to keep things decent—this all for the edification of the half-naked mechanics at the far end of the runway.</p><p>It wasn't all trash and vaudeville, though. Non-theme-y outerwear pieces like a leather pod coat and a yellow trapeze jacket looked like they'll have legs off the runway. Those are the kind of items that have earned the Catens a place in the hearts of retailers. But, of course, that's not the first thing people come to a Dsquared² show for. They come for the theater—the cheap yet satisfying thrills that a runway sighting of a star like Rihanna can provide.</p></div>"
70,spring,2008,s2008,duro-olowu,"Duro Olowu has taken a sideways-on approach to becoming a presence at London fashion week. Building a business from his Portobello Road store, he first emerged as the designer of a single dress—an internationally recognized, flowy, patchworked print frock. Now, in his second season on the runway, he stepped up to the next level with an accomplished collection inspired, he said, by ""the colors of the great jewels of the maharanis of India, the Baroda pearls, emeralds, and rubies.""</p><p>Not that it was a literal trip around the subcontinent. Olowu focused on a put-together look, opening with a jade-green, belted tailored pantsuit and a ruffled shirt in navy gingham, with a sparkling brooch at the neck—chic, down to the flat snakeskin sandals. He caught the London mood for color and breezy prints in an individual way with flowered dresses falling to the mid-calf and ending in ruffled hemlines. Simple shapes, maybe, but Olowu's uniqueness lies in his sure-handed way of sourcing precious old-school couture fabrics, and piecing them together in unexpected combinations. Thus, the familiar ""Duro dress"" has transitioned into a trapeze shape with tiered volume in front, cut from bolts of vintage couture silks, and detailed with patches of sequin. In all, it was a confirmation that this Nigerian-born designer has a clarity of vision that can build a brand—and an imaginative empathy that helps him design clothes women like to wear, come summer.</p></div>"
71,spring,2008,s2008,elie-saab,"Hear Saab's name trumpeted at an awards show and you can be guaranteed a few things: sequins, curves, a fair bit of skin. And he didn't stray from the program in his overlong show for Spring. He had dresses for all sorts of Hollywood types: fifties fit-and-flare in large-scale florals for starlets, silvery Art Deco sequins for sirens, floor-sweeping chiffon for grandes dames. And he had them, to borrow an expression from garmento parlance, in many different colorways: red, green, purple, blue, yellow, straight out of the Crayola box.</p><p>If it sounds a bit all over the place, it was. At 60 looks, the collection needed a major edit. You would've expected that if Saab had learned anything that fateful night when Halle Berry wore his nude-torsoed, leaf-scattered, russet gown to win her Oscar, it would be that the leading ladies he's outfitting demand something unique. As it was, this felt more like a tour through a garment-district wholesaler than a glimpse of precious one-offs bound for the Kodak Theatre.</p></div>"
72,spring,2008,s2008,elie-tahari,"It's been a busy summer for Elie Tahari, who recently celebrated the opening of his boutique on Main Street in East Hampton. With lots of bright ethnic prints and safari looks, his Spring collection ventured into more exotic climes. The longer hemlines were, Tahari says, ""inspired by my wife."" Standout pieces included suede jackets with knotted details, dresses with cutouts, and a crisp white shirtdress with three-quarter sleeves.</p></div>"
73,spring,2008,s2008,emilio-pucci,"The fast route to a successful summer Pucci show would seem obvious: Book a flight to Capri. After all, that's the Italian island paradise most closely associated with the print house born exactly 60 years ago. But Matthew Williamson chose a different path: He went way out west to Navajo country, which has become a minor theme of the week. The results were predictably somewhat mixed.</p><p>On the plus side were a shift dress and egg-shaped evening coat in matte black sequins with starbursts of color, a boho deluxe belted feather coat in dégradé shades of turquoise, a kaleidoscope-print caftan, and a scarf dress worn with a big amulet necklace. As for the negatives, the worst offender was probably a look comprised of a so-eighties knit shell open to the waistband at the sides and full-leg aquamarine pants. His suede poncho with triangular panels of multicolor snakeskin decorating the neckline fell somewhere in the middle. You could see one of Williamson's It-girl girlfriends pulling it off, and that's sort of telling. Rather than developing a distinct focus, his Pucci collections are starting to look more and more like his signature line.</p></div>"
74,spring,2008,s2008,emporio-armani,"The show opened with an advertisement for Emporio Armani's new fragrance, Diamonds, starring Beyoncé Knowles performing the famous Marilyn Monroe tune (""I don't mean rhinestones!"" et cetera). Wanton commercialism? Maybe. But there's no denying Armani was onto something: A few hours later, Frida Giannini would kick off the Gucci show with a perfume ad directed by David Lynch. If nothing else, the coincidence gave the ""Beyond trends"" phrase Armani flashed across his runway backdrop an extra spin.</p><p>But it has to be said: This little-sister line did have it all. There were an array of jackets, in black-and-white checks, in wool bouclés, in washed silks—the best was an elongated satin-lapelled tux worn with short shorts. Rhinestone-encrusted halters also made the lineup, as did crystal-studded strapless tops, sequined tanks, and modified versions of those knee-tied pants Armani showed on Monday. Then there were brief minis, poufy skirts that came with matching knickers, and silk tap pants. If you want a romper, Emporio's got those, too. Holding it all together was a ""Don't worry, be happy"" attitude that should go over well with the Beyoncé generation. And how about those smiles on the models' faces?</p></div>"
75,spring,2008,s2008,erdem,"Erdem Moralioglu invoked Saint Laurent's ""wrong-rightness"" to add some spine to his fourth collection. ""I wanted to put things together that didn't go together,"" he said after a show that climaxed in a mash-up of biker jacket and bridal gown. YSL's contrary spirit also ruled in a color scheme that saw red, pink, and gray stripes defining body-limning little dresses. The master, having once scandalously proposed a raincoat as the suitable accompaniment for an evening dress at Glyndebourne, might even recognize a kindred spirit in Erdem, with his bubble-backed mac in the same shade used for fishermen's sou'westers. (An ongoing collaboration with Mackintosh once again yielded some of the strongest pieces on this runway.)</p><p>Of course, it's really much too premature to weight Erdem's budding trajectory with such analogies. His own focus was on his fabrics—the taffetas, silks, and weaves were all custom-made for him. The fan-pleating that fell away from a tiny ""biker jacket"" bodice or cascaded down the back of a trapeze dress was his way of ""allowing the fabric to do what it wants to do."" These swinging shapes were better ambassadors for the designer than some of the more fitted pieces or the harem pant silhouette (here, Erdem turned Eden, as in Barbara).</p><p>If the Mackintoshes were a winning holdover from seasons past, so were the prints, botanicals blown up and smudged on the computer until they looked familiar-yet-not. A full print dress fanning out from the tight little apex of a halter nudged the Erdem ethos up a notch in sophistication. At the same time, it highlighted the fact that Erdem's work, like that of many of his London peers, thrives in its own slightly surreal little bubble.</p></div>"
76,spring,2008,s2008,erin-fetherston,"Backstage before her show, Erin Fetherston tossed around such fashion-isms as ""eccentric glamour"" and ""kooky sophistication"" before remarking, ""I think the ultimate luxury in fashion is to be yourself, to celebrate your personality."" Combine those utterances with the fact that the collection was named Flights of Fancy, and it seemed like we were in for a typically whimsical outing from the designer. It was a surprise, then, to witness an elegant, grown-up parade of plain silks in grays and pales. Fetherston didn't neglect the sweetly girlish sensibility that has made her clothes must-haves among a fashion-obsessed clique of starlets such as Kirsten Dunst and Zooey Deschanel. But by sending out looks like a nipped-waist blouse paired with slim, dove-gray-hued pants, she should attract new fans. Her kookiness revealed itself in stealth form, most engagingly in two charming line-drawing prints of birds and shells, cut into slim shifts and trenches. Fetherston accessorized her polished outfits with cat-eye glasses, a pearly conch handbag, and enough headgear—from feathered headbands to turbans—to make Arden Wohl green with envy, but none of it was a distraction.</p></div>"
77,spring,2008,s2008,etro,"With the seventies back on the runways, Veronica Etro is back in her element. A bohemian with a luxe magpie aesthetic, she let her freak flag fly.</p><p>The first look was a slim belted coat with eccentric lapels covered in dense loops of red yarn, worn with sporty color-block leggings. From there, she delved into cargo jackets and pants paired with filmy chiffon tops or rugby-stripe sweaters, multicolor hippie-chic crochet dresses, cutaway military jackets with frogging and contrast trim, and silk caftans printed front and center with talismanic agates. To call it kaleidoscopic would be an understatement.</p><p>The show¿s dominant silhouette was a fitted torso—a studded leather vest, say, topping an earth-toned silk tee—and a short, flaring skirt. At the middle were belts decorated with all manner of tassels, embroideries, and pompoms, elements that reappeared on shoes and bags. At times, it was all too costumey; take, for instance, a new-age long jersey tank dress with deep silver fringing at the neckline. But peel back Etro¿s many layers and you reveal pieces that are not only on-message for the season (ethnic prints, tie-dyes, tiny leather jackets), but also, and this is more important, desirable.</p></div>"
78,spring,2008,s2008,fashion-east,"If there's one image that sums up the razzy side of London's energy now, it's this: Agyness Deyn, ripping down the runway in a studded patent maroon-and-mustard hot-pants set, opening Henry Holland's second show under the Fashion East umbrella. You can't hear the roars in the photograph, but the place, a scuzzy vacant East End warehouse, was packed to the paint-peeling rafters with every dressed-up club kid, tranny, and student in town—there to honor the boy designer and his best friend, the choppy bottle blonde, who in the past year has glided to international fame on <em>Vogue</em> covers. Note: She wasn't wearing a saucy, rhyming slogan T-shirt.</p><p>Holland, in spite of his party-boy status, had actually knuckled down to some work. Nagged by members of his circle, he got the message that, after triggering a much ripped-off trend, he needed to move on. ""A friend of mine went down to the <em>Vogue</em> library and found all these early nineties pictures of Stephanie Seymour and Axl Rose. I thought they looked so brilliant,"" he said. The words ""a friend of mine"" are the ones to note here, just as much as the hilarious heavy-metal theme, which produced tie-dyed, hyper-color prints for T-shirts, body dresses, and rubber swimwear bits and pieces. Holland had pulled in a backup band of London-based accessory aces—Stuart Vevers (he of Mulberry, soon to be at Loewe) on bags, Katie Hillier (she of Marc by Marc) on knuckle-dusters and earrings, Linda Farrow Vintage on sunglasses, and newcomer Atalanta Weber on wicked glossy spike-winged wedges. As a moment, it put the spotlight on the collaborative energy coming out of this city—transient, maybe, but for now, at least, rooted in a ""just do it"" level of professionalism that was really quite a surprise.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>Just out of London's Central Saint Martins' M.A. degree course, Louise Gray is a Scottish textile designer with a strong flair for color. She went to graduate school eager to blow the stuffiness out of embroidery, and for her that means experimenting with chiffon and using it in vivid combinations of lemon and turquoise, emerald and gray, cobalt and flesh, and peach and navy. Her shift dresses came with multilayered geometric decorations—discs, triangles, and squares—pinned on with cheap trinket components and hardware bought in the local DIY store. She has a look that's simple to wear (if you're not self-conscious about things dangling from your breast area) and has a ways to develop. But as one of the new hardworking Scots who is shaking up London—after Christopher Kane and Jonathan Saunders—she's someone to watch.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""fquwyr""></div></div><p>When you see a person with a towering pile of wig, a painted germ-protecting mask, and a shredded T-shirt reading ""HAVE YOU EVOLVED?"" coming at you down a runway, you know you're not in for fashion as you know it. With London's pioneer underground recycler, the ""ragger"" JJ Hudson, for a designer, the Noki House of Sustainability message is one of corporate rage, urban tribalism, and quite a bit of camp fun. ""I'm the dark side of Green,"" he says. Shredded heavy-metal tour T-shirts and chopped-up superhero and Mickey Mouse play clothes are the materials, along with reappropriated Burberry-style check shirts and argyle socks with the diamonds cut out. Cheesy eighties taffeta cocktail dresses were sewn to the bottoms of tees to make travesty ""evening gowns."" Needless to say, this is all very editorial for a certain magazine sect, but Noki is not up for sales. What he wants, instead, is for young people to copy his work, ""because everyone can do it for themselves.""</p></div>"
79,spring,2008,s2008,fendi,"It's been ten years since the Fendi Baguette lit the touch paper on the explosive—and still booming—market for It bags. That was why it turned up again today—in a new manifestation as a squishy oversize clutch, casually clamped to the sides of a few of Karl Lagerfeld's Spring looks for the house. This wasn't really a grandstanding statement, though, because Fendi has long since segued into new fields, and Lagerfeld never goes in for anniversaries anyhow.</p><p>Thanks to his constant forward motion, the image of Italy's foremost fur house has, over time, transitioned into a ready-to-wear label that is now bought by stores year-round. There's always something to be found here that jibes with the subtexts of current trends. This season, it's all in the drapey jersey dresses in barely-there blues and _eau de nil_s. These long flyaway numbers with their handkerchief-point sleeves and trailing scarves bring to mind the romantic cult that surrounded Chloé in the seventies. That may be a reference point for several other designers for Spring, but aficionados will savor the fact that these Fendi versions are, in one sense, originals. After all, they come from the very hand that started the whole thing in the first place.</p></div>"
80,spring,2008,s2008,salvatore-ferragamo,"This was Graeme Black's last collection for Salvatore Ferragamo; he¿s leaving to devote himself to his solo line. To be fair, setting a ready-to-wear direction for a label best known for its grosgrain ribbon flats is no easy task. But hopscotching back through the decades—as Black had tended to do during his tenure—probably wasn't the best tack.</p><p>For Spring, he seized on the seventies. Mixed in with the more restrained Me Decade pieces (high-waisted, wide-legged trousers and flaring A-line skirts) were Halston jersey dresses, beachy caftans, and jumpsuits, the last in wide navy-and-white stripes or disco sequins.</p><p>The show was not without its better moments. Floor-grazing sheer shirtdresses had stature, and the turquoise stone strap of a finale gown was a rich touch. But here's hoping that when Cristina Ortiz steps into the driver's seat, she pushes Ferragamo further forward. The clothes could stand to be more distinctive, more than simply a backdrop for handbags and shoes. Perhaps she can zero in on the luxury factor, like Tomas Maier has done at Bottega Veneta (which not so long ago, you'll recall, was little more than an accessories company with a specialty in woven leather bags).</p></div>"
81,spring,2008,s2008,gareth-pugh,"You had to wonder quite how the models were going to make an entrance onto Gareth Pugh's runway, what with that giant white rubber balloon blocking the door. Then, with a big pop, the thing exploded, and on came an individual with a glittery cube for a headpiece and a top-to-toe outfit in Swarovski crystal mesh. This time round, there seemed less of the screamy reaction that usually greets his high-camp performance pieces. Maybe fewer of Pugh's club-kid fans had fought their way in. Or is this the start of a post-novelty cooling-off phase, as all and sundry are left to contemplate how this dedicated enfant terrible is really going to earn a crust?</p><p>From the runway pieces, it's quite possible to see how his dark-side coats, with their giant fringe-bristling shoulders, might find certain takers in the rock industry. As one-offs, they could fill the stage of any stadium. A stole made of white mink mice, complete with red eyes and tails? It could work for an encore. Or as window-dressing, come Halloween, perhaps. Real world, though? Hard to imagine many female customers for his ribbon-leather body dresses, no matter how much slaving it takes to sew them. Perhaps the conundrum will be solved when buyers travel to Paris to see Pugh's collection up close under Rick Owens' roof. Owens' wife, Michele Lamy, who has a stellar reputation as a manager, is overseeing Pugh's production. Maybe there are moderated designs in the works. There need to be, unless Pugh is quite happy to continue, hand-to-mouth, relying on the indulgence of sponsors, and the diminishing returns as newer designers come up.</p></div>"
82,spring,2008,s2008,giambattista-valli,"Giambattista Valli always has a particular woman in mind when he starts his collection. This season, it was Veruschka in her desert mode, which (partially) explained his opening caftan shape, caught in at the ankles as an all-in-one. Valli had also been inspired by a research trip to Jordan (it may be significant that Queen Rania is a known client of his), where he was stunned by the sights of ancient Petra and the brilliance of flowers blooming against the dusty noncolors of the landscape.</p><p>Valli doesn't really come from high concept, though. His are couture-based skills, and from his close relationships with a refined crowd of international clients—a flock of whom crowded the backstage area to congratulate him—he has learned how to meld Parisian luxe into socially appropriate, climate-aware dressing for places where women want to look very special indeed. What that means is: He's worked out how to deal lightly with volume, surface embellishment, and color that looks good in the sun. All those qualities came through in his use of pretty white organza and chiffon, minutely pleated into short, full-skirted dresses; shots of neon lime and fuchsia, occasionally backlit with streaks of gold; and crunchy patches of stone embroideries. If his desert Veruschka theme didn't really hold throughout the collection, well, never mind. The customers he's talking to hardly need concept to validate a drifty, strapless georgette Valli gown. It is what it is: specifically targeted service, well done.</p></div>"
83,spring,2008,s2008,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré died in June, and although rumors swirl that Lars Nilsson will step in, the house has not yet appointed a successor. For Spring, it presented a collection by committee, designed by Ferré's former team. The show was held not in the company headquarters, as usual, but in the Fondazione Arnaldo Pomodoro, a small museum in Milan.</p><p>The venue change begged a few questions: Was this going to be an homage to ""the architect of fashion,"" known for precise tailoring and a flair for menswear? Or was it a signal that the collection was moving forward in a different gear? As it turned out, it was neither.</p><p>Gone were Ferré's sculptural silhouettes; in their stead was a flowing, languid look. Suits were cut in fluid washed satin with slim jackets and high-waisted palazzo pants. Hints of his famous white shirts could be seen in the poet blouses, but with their drawstrings and lacings they seemed altogether too fussy to have met with Ferré's approval. He might've liked the beaded and crystal-studded bustier dresses that closed the show, if only for the way their armorlike effect played subtly to his gender-bender streak, but there was a big disconnect between the oeuvre of a designer who didn't chase trends and a series of tiered silk smock and trapeze dresses that looked like this summer's chain-store fare. This is a collection in holding pattern, and a confused one at that. Ferré and his legacy deserve more.</p></div>"
84,spring,2008,s2008,giles-deacon,"There are some collections in which asking what inspired the designer adds nothing to the clothes in front of you, where trying to follow a thread of logic actually gets in the way of seeing the designs. Giles Deacon is the world's prime example: His work is randomness incarnate. It can't keep to any one message, or develop an intellectual thesis. If you're looking for a point, he'll never get to it. These are all potentially exasperating traits, but in Deacon's case, you need to put them aside. Because in spite of them, his collections are increasingly full of wonderful things.</p><p>Is there really any logic to a show that starts out with sober, gray denim Alaïa-ish tailoring, moves through duchesse satin fifties debutante gowns, Marie Antoinette milkmaid dresses, some breezy silk T-shirt dresses, giant fuzzy photo prints of Kate Moss, balls of layered tulle, and a print of Bambi with blood spurting from its neck? Deacon said afterward that he was digging out his old record collection and came across eighties album designs on the 4AD label, like the Cocteau Twins, and the Sex Pistols' ""Who Killed Bambi?"". That might explain the punk-fetish connection which popped up in 3-D rubber roses and a peculiarly great-looking pale-pink trench with hundreds of brown elastic bands knitted onto the front to mimic fur.</p><p>But he soon admitted today's show was just as much about following up on the commercial success of his well-received first pre-Spring collection, in which he decided to make everything lighter and ""go a bit mad, really"" with fabric and embellishment. ""It's almost like we're inventing our own textiles."" So, a hanger inspection of the clothes backstage is a much more revealing exercise than trying to drag theory out of the designer. Then, the level of handwork in the painted fabrics, the multi-layers of tulle petticoat, and the construction of a panniered coat becomes clear, and the real attraction of Deacon's clothes becomes unarguable.</p></div>"
85,spring,2008,s2008,giorgio-armani,"The languid, sensual summers of southern Italy were Giorgio Armani's starting point this season—or so his program notes said. From the looks of the silk ""trousers tied at the knee,"" the long wrapping scarves in glittering beads, and the harem-pant gowns, he could have been revisiting India (the country that inspired his terrific Privé couture show in January) by way of the Middle East. While this collection didn't pack quite the knockout punch that Privé did, it scored points with some lovely clothes.</p><p>Whatever the inspiration for those unusual pants, Armani came up with an endless variety of covetable tops to wear with them: short jackets, in gray or navy, over longer silk tunics; crocheted cardigans dusted with glitter; slim, almost mannish, blazers; and beaded racer-back evening tanks, the best an emerald-green version that, one editor whispered, would be great with a regular pair of jeans.</p><p>Looking beyond the <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em> evening jumpsuits, Armani showed an array of real-life after-dark options, ranging from red-carpet crystal-beaded gowns with deep fringe below the knee to less formal, but no less special, styles with bamboolike embroidery that should play to the crowds descending on his new Tokyo flagship when it opens in Ginza this November. Milan, Japan, or Mumbai—Armani's brand of romance knows no borders.</p></div>"
86,spring,2008,s2008,givenchy,"Riccardo Tisci made real strides with his last ready-to-wear show. There were a number of stylish early adopters in Givenchy numbers straight off that runway in today's front row—always a good way to judge a collection's success. But Spring, as it unfolded, found him up to some of his old tricks, laying on far more detail than his otherwise accomplished tailored suiting pieces and right-for-this-season draped asymmetric dresses could handle.</p><p>Going by the knee-high gladiator sandals and utilitarian leather belt bags and fanny packs, not to mention the models' bleached eyebrows, Tisci's theme seemed to be warrior women, a motif he also referenced at his recent couture show. That would explain the large grommets on everything from sturdy blazers to willowy chiffon (it must be said that using such heavy hardware on so delicate a material is pretty impractical, if not plain silly). If those looks reflected his theme, the oversize polka dots on bubble dresses and the shiny black pearls that studded a waistcoat were more of a leap.</p><p>The show ended on a high note, though. The designer's unadorned, faintly military jackets, bustiers, and skirts in rugged brown leather revealed that, yes, there is a cool, controlled sense of minimalism lurking underneath all that other stuff. It's a sensibility Tisci should nurture.</p></div>"
87,spring,2008,s2008,gucci,"Frida Giannini's Spring collection was a difficult thing to categorize. Granted, she had picked up on some of the things going around this season—the fifties big-skirted silhouette, a bit of toga dressing, patent-leather accessories. Alongside that, she put in some of her more pragmatic daywear: the new Frida trouser (roomier in the hip, slouchier in the crotch, narrowed in the leg), boyish checked shirts, and the odd little cropped biker jacket, including a noticeably good one in black snakeskin.</p><p>It was hard, however, to warm to the whole. Part of the problem was the unrelenting combination of black, white, and a particularly harsh sunflower yellow, which played through oversize abstract flower-print mini deb dresses and bustier bubbles, and never gave up until the last red-carpet taffeta gowns left the runway. Sequencing-wise, the show was bumpy, too, with much reiteration of the same shapes in different fabrications. For evening—a Gucci heartland—the dresses came with broad belts and the occasional integral shoulder strap fastened with oversize horse bits—a house signature that seemed to weigh all too heavily on everything in sight. It was an off moment, or maybe just an example of performance nerves from a young designer who has so much to live up to. Giannini's recent Resort show was better and more coherent than this, so by the time both collections hit stores and are blended together, it's possible the result will be just fine.</p></div>"
88,spring,2008,s2008,haider-ackermann,"Flowers? You won't find them sprouting on Haider Ackermann's runway. (Well, not unless you look very, very carefully at a metallic black brocade he used for a kimono coat.)</p><p>The designer—who said he was ""searching for a woman far away, someone eccentric, aristocratic, sensual""—opened with a blazer in a shimmery purple-black, worn with a matching scarf-necked blouse and shorts. There were a number of angular, strong-shouldered jackets in the lineup, paired with the harem pants of the moment or, much more provocatively, with sheer gray or taupe fishtail skirts suspended from the shoulders or waist by the narrowest of strings. Linings will be a must if these pieces make it to retail. And the billowing organza caftans that gave his models a bit of trouble on the runway could use a retail tweak, too—several inches off the bottom would do the trick. The dresses with twisted halter necks in liquid jersey were just as sensual, but much more viable.</p><p>This was a dark, broodingly sexy collection that was at odds with the season's almost giddy spirits, and though it was not without faults, it was all the more compelling for it.</p></div>"
89,spring,2008,s2008,heatherette,"""Fun, fun, fun is the name of the game!"" boomed Heatherette designer Richie Rich's disembodied voice as the first look made its way down the raised runway at Gotham Hall. He couldn't have said it better: In the world of Rich and co-conspirator Traver Rains, fun is a tangible commodity to be bought and sold. There was plenty of it at their surefire Spring show, which opened with an energetic performance by 18-year-old rising hip-hop star Lil Mama and four dancers, delighting a crowd that included Diddy, Lance Bass, Bijou Phillips, and Tinsley Mortimer.</p><p>This was followed by a series of white looks loaded up with all manner of lace, trimmings, and rickrack, making the models look like wayward brides in a sort of backward couture show. (Guess after Marc Jacobs, it's the week for that sort of thing.) However, the meat of the collection, named Star-Spangled Smiles, was a big red-white-and-blue dose of Americana. The designers endlessly riffed on the theme with a picnic-table print complete with graphic black ants, gingham farmer's-daughter dresses, and a touch of both camouflage and good old American showgirls. Wearable? Sure, a little. But what sells for the duo are the hoodies and tees worn by Lil Mama and her dancers. (Come springtime, these will be joined in stores by the printed vinyl bags and shoes Heatherette produces with Irregular Choice, which will likely be just as popular.)</p><p>Still, a stars-and-stripes extravaganza on September 11? ""It just worked out that way,"" Rich and Rains explained backstage. ""We talked about colors and came up with red, white, and blue, then we realized that we'd never done an Americana collection."" As with any Heatherette show, there were a few finales, including porn-star Jenna Jameson flouncing down the runway. But more exciting for the designers' future was the group of five-year-old models in the debut of their cartoony-cute children's line named Heatherette Mini. One question: Why not call it Club Kids?</p></div>"
90,spring,2008,s2008,helmut-lang,"The re-launch of Helmut Lang, now owned by Link Theory Holdings, is as a contemporary—that is, more affordable—line, as opposed to a luxury one. Michael and Nicole Colovos, the founders of Habitual jeans, were tapped to get the job done some three years ago. For their first bona fide runway show, this week, Nicole said that she and her partner had decided to concentrate on ""modern fabrics and architectural lines."" In other words, they decided to stay true to the soul of the brand.</p><p>The collection stuck to the script: Out came the requisite straps and harnesses; also, better-than-basic tanks for layering, sharp narrow pants, slick blazer jackets, and monochrome color schemes. Some of the fabrics looked high-tech but actually were made mostly of natural fibers, woven and coated in innovative ways (though some less-structured looks were made up in a taffeta that crinkled like a black plastic deli bag). A sleeveless hoodie in glazed leather nodded to Spring's active trend.</p><p>The attitude was hard-edged, but not menacing. In fact, an asymmetrical pool blue dress with attached swag had romance to it. The minimalist palette of white, slate, black, and blue, was based, in part, on the Colovoses' study, Michael said, of ice and its different ""colors, layers, structures, and forms."" Cool enough…and the Colovoses are obviously warming to their assignment.</p></div>"
91,spring,2008,s2008,hermes,"A quick nip into the Hermès boutique on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré on a fall Saturday and what's remarkable, beyond all the euros flying across the counter, is how international the customers are. Jean Paul Gaultier gave a nod to Hermès' increasingly multicultural clientele with a grand tour of India for Spring. It was something of a wink, too, because in signature J.P.G. form, he came close to camp in pursuit of his theme. There was the Hermès-orange backdrop that slowly turned cinnamon as spices drifted down it, and, of course, there was the headgear: turbans done up in colorful silk or crocodile, or the models' own hair twisted and pinned into a curvy topknot.</p><p>Gaultier started with white Nehru jackets worn over jodhpurs, proceeded to suede tunics with burnished brass embroidery and safari suits in navy or army green, and followed these with many variations on a colonialist's costume of knit vest over crisp, white button-down and pants tucked into riding boots. He also indulged in a bit of silk-scarf dressing. Evening presented two options: first, reinterpreted ribbon-edged saris swung up over one shoulder, or tunics—these both worn with matching knee pants or leggings—and second, billowy silk gowns with trailing capes in lush jewel tones. Lose the over-the-top props, and these clothes are superluxe and unmistakably Hermès. (Where else can you get a pair of white-croc riding boots?) And that is precisely what all those shoppers are angling for.</p></div>"
92,spring,2008,s2008,iceberg,"Iceberg's Spring collection keyed into the nineties body-con trend that's still reverberating out from London. Clingy jersey dresses, with cutouts at the hips or down the back, revealed more than they concealed. Likewise the high-waisted shorts that were alternately paired with bell-sleeve blouses in a high-metallic sheen or boxier cropped sweaters. And then there was the sequined, zip-front all-in-one that closed the show.</p><p>All in all, this is probably a smart way to lure that sweet-spot shopper, one who has a tight body to show off and money to burn. (The geometric plastic paillettes that decorated a lot of the evening numbers surely won't come cheap.) But will the same client go for the more challenging outerwear? Coats, usually a strong suit at this Italian label, came in kimono cuts with huge, statement-making lantern sleeves. It's a look very much in keeping with the Eastern silhouettes influencing the Milan shows, but their viability at retail is less of a sure thing.</p></div>"
93,spring,2008,s2008,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel cited the French photographer Guy Bourdin, master of erotic innuendo, as his touchstone. In the seventies, Bourdin shot fashion like a high-gloss crime scene—black latex, sharp heels, sprawling legs, and the like. And Mendel's most prominent pieces for Spring did have a whiff, if not of danger, at least of haute disco dash: off-the-shoulder silk mousseline, for instance, that caught seductively at the hips, and tiered columns trimmed with (what else?) gold lamé.</p><p>Overall, however, the more sexed-up approach didn't play to Mendel's strong points of sophistication and romance. What's more, in a seeming attempt to keep his balance, he latched on to some complicated and couture-like lattice and pleating techniques, crisscrossing them in (too) many variations throughout. In the end, of course, he couldn't resist a painted flower here and a lace insert there, and in those <em>vie en rose</em> touches the real Gilles shone through.</p></div>"
94,spring,2008,s2008,jasmine-di-milo,"""I was inspired by the anatomical buildings of the architect Santiago Calatrava,"" said Jasmine Al Fayed at her show. A lofty reference for a young designer who's best known for her louche cocktail dresses—and for being the daughter of Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed. But then, that's not the only change at the house of Jasmine Di Milo. First off, Al Fayed has switched from a late-night show to a civilized all-day affair at the Ritz. Then there's the redesigned label affixed to her creations—it's streamlined and simple, instead of dark and goth. And there was improvement in the clothes themselves. The collection is still rather narrowly focused on after-dark looks, but in place of flashy sequins and trashy sheer numbers, there were goddess gowns, trapezes, and sexy bandage dresses à la Hervé Léger. A few sportswear pieces like satin bombers even made it into the lineup. You can't call it high fashion yet, but you can say Al Fayed is growing up.</p></div>"
95,spring,2008,s2008,jason-wu,"The Wu label, now in its fourth season, is slowly crystallizing into the sort worn by a well-groomed young lady with a penchant for immaculate details, the kind of girl who could be a future couture customer if she plays her career (or matrimonial) cards right. Grace Kelly is by now a bit of a careworn reference in the fashion world, but that's just who Wu's Spring show brought to mind: a contemporary version of the movie icon as she appeared in <em>Rear Window</em>.</p><p>Wu played to his customer with a pretty and well-constructed collection, keeping his waists high (and punctuated with narrow patent belts), his silhouettes lean (save for a few circle skirts of the 1950's-Kelly ilk), and his shapes classic (the sheath, the trench, the strapless tea-length cocktail dress). For the first time, he introduced pattern to his previously more restrained color palette, with hand-painted prints inspired by René Gruau, the illustrator eulogized in <em>The Guardian</em> as the ""chief visualiser"" to the great couturier Christian Dior. Bold and graphic, these had a strong impact in cherry red, acid yellow, and electric blue.</p><p>The show closed with a series of evening gowns, the most impressive of which was a mottled-gray chiffon number hand-sewn from a tremendous 55 yards of fabric, all cut on the bias. It was a demonstration of craftsmanship that not many twentysomething designers could have pulled off.</p></div>"
96,spring,2008,s2008,jean-paul-gaultier,"Captain Jack Sparrow is alive and well, and you could spy him tonight at Gaultier. Amid the smoke and spotlights at the back of his runway was a pirate girl wearing swashbuckling jodhpurs, a black blouse gathered and twisted below the bosom, and a wide-brimmed hat- all that was missing was the gold teeth and the eye liner. Like the <em>Black Pearl</em>, Gaultier's ship gets around. From North American shores came the camouflage, cut into vests, trenches, and sleeveless dresses, trussed up here with military frogging and fringed epaulets. From Africa, the safari jackets and the multicolor crochet dresses. France provided the sailor sweater, done up not in the designer's signature off-white and navy striped cotton, but in sequins and beads.</p><p>The pirate conceit gave this layer-loving designer an opportunity to really pour it on, and not just with the accessories. (Which, by the way, included all manner of fringed scarves, skullcaps, pipes—Lily Donaldson puffed away as she strutted down the runway—and the occasional umbrella with a pistol for a handle.) There were bustiers made from three torso-gripping leather belts, alternately paired with a weightless cardigan and silken balloon pants or an off-kilter tutu—one side cut at the hips, the other extending to mid-calf—with striped tights peeking out from underneath.</p><p>Instead of his usual solitary finale bride, Gaultier sent out a veritable bridal party in bohemian crochet, eyelet, and lace, or creamy clouds of tulle. Not one was likely to march down a church aisle without a few alterations for modesty's sake, but no matter: The pirate tale was thrill-a-minute, and, picked apart, filled with plenty of wearable booty.</p></div>"
97,spring,2008,s2008,jenni-kayne,"Jenni Kayne traded the tents for a two-hour afternoon tableau vivant in a midtown penthouse, citing the ""crowded schedule"" and a desire for editors and buyers to see how precise her message is. The celebrity eye candy (Mischa Barton, the Olsens) that this L.A. native's shows are usually good for was missing, but it seems like the prospect of presenting in such a relaxed setting helped the designer clear her head. Kayne has fumbled in the past when she's tricked things out for the runway, and for Spring she pared back and returned to an era that's interested her since her beginnings about five years ago—the seventies, or more precisely, the seventies with a thirties twist.</p><p>A long sundress in a cheery yellow ikat print stood side by side with a raglan sleeve Greta Garbo gown in moody peacock green. Pinching and tucking at the neckline turned a glorified silver jacquard T-shirt dress into something memorable. The collection was also strong on tailoring. Kayne's boxy boyfriend blazers looked right over both a jersey T-shirt and trouser shorts, as well as a cocktail dress—that is, until you saw the cropped jacket and low-slung pleated trousers worn with flat sandals, which somehow seemed newer. A loose scoop-neck tee and a glossy black high-waisted skirt had not much to do with either of Kayne's favorite decades, but nonetheless, the combination looked like a winner.</p></div>"
98,spring,2008,s2008,jens-laugesen,"Jens Laugesen may be London's best object lesson in sticking to your guns. In the late nineties when Helmut Lang was God, this Danish-born designer started working, like many others, on edgy tailoring. Then Lang disappeared, and Laugesen's minimal suiting experiments elicited minimal interest. Now, though—in a season when the young London fashion crowd is turning up at the shows in variations on sharp tailoring—his persistence may finally pay off.</p><p>In this century, Stefano Pilati has sparked the renewed interest in jackets. In other words, it's tux time again. That puts Laugesen's narrow gold lamé jacket with black satin revers and his white A-line dinner jacket in the frame. He's also thought about what to wear beneath them to create the right leggy proportion: The solution is a hybrid of woven fabric and Lycra that looks newer than leggings.</p><p>Laugesen's dissections of men's formalwear into boleros, vests, and bib-front shirts were all strong, but he should've either stopped there, or pushed it further. The second half of the show wandered off into a far less convincing dalliance with dresses and Cardin-like circle cutting. Why? If he concentrated on what he's good at, his message would be far stronger.</p></div>"
99,spring,2008,s2008,jeremy-laing,"Laing is a designer with an architect's sensibility, and his clothes sheath the body in sweeping planes and facets constructed with the technical precision of a blueprint. This season, his third, he cited ""apparitions of light"" as his inspiration: fireworks, the northern lights, and lens flares (the enigmatic flashes accidentally captured sometimes in photographs). Those are some pretty ephemeral effects to tease out of fabric and thread, and the only reference obvious enough to be picked up on by the naked eye was the pyrotechnic one: a spectacular fireworks print created by the artist Karen Azoulay.</p><p>Whether or not Laing's luminous conceits were tangibly interpreted, the clothes looked great. The designer worked those structured folds to clever effect, creating both slim and voluminous silhouettes out of the high-tech fabrics he loves. ""Wedges"" folded into the back seaming of a dress were wrapped around to the front, magically inverting to create a horizontal ruffle across the bodice. A deep, asymmetrical fold was slashed across the length of a belted sack dress, leaving one side tented and the other slim as a blade of grass. For a softer air, Laing cut the same shapes from washed silk, in light gray, butter yellow, and midnight blue.</p></div>"
100,spring,2008,s2008,jil-sander,"There's no doubt Raf Simons has made significant strides toward putting the credibility back into Jil Sander. He sees the project clearly and clinically, rigorously realigning the brand with the purist, slightly Japanese-influenced values its founder brought to fashion. Part of the task is to renew the core of the label's tailoring, particularly by reinventing the money-spinning house pantsuit, which has to find a way to move on from the sober nineties template. That Simons did, by recutting the elements into two distinct silhouettes. The newer one shrinks the jacket to a super-short bolero; elongates the torso with a tight, hip-length knit; and then breaks into a full, fluid pant beneath. The other approach flips it, with a looser, longer jacket (chopped off at the shoulder as a bustier in the show's first exit) over pants so narrow they're virtually indistinguishable from leggings.</p><p>To be picky on the pragmatic front, though—since Sander's high-flying customer base is that, above all—there are difficulties. One: The crop of the jacket might work on a flat-chested beanpole model, but on a woman with a real-life bosom? Two: Those super-skinny pants are not the most forgiving when viewed from behind. And then there's the color: Simons is right to seek an exit from the clichéd minimal-monochrome palette, but his liking for hot pink, orange, and vivid royal blue seems unlikely to hit the spot at retail. For all that eye-catching assertiveness—and the arty uses of sheer versus opaque, and organza-and-tulle pieces cut in circles and squares, and the passage of the Sander woman in holiday beachwear—it was two midnight blue looks that made the strongest impressions. One was a long jacket, semi-fitted in the front but nicely curved into the small of the back, the other an asymmetrically draped sleeveless dress; both were quintessentially the things that will keep the faithful shopping.</p></div>"
101,spring,2008,s2008,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart had just wrapped an interview in which she praised the punctuality and professionalism of Lindsay Lohan, her current ad campaign star and America's number one screwup (poor Britney excluded). The designer probably shouldn't have been surprised by the next question: Did her Spring collection have a good-girls-behaving-badly theme?</p><p>Stuart paused before answering. ""No,"" she said, smiling.</p><p>But the fashion industry, like the country at large, is obviously fascinated with the delinquent sorority sisters of Hollywood. And despite Stuart's somewhat coy denial, there were plenty of devilish ideas about angels gone wrong on her runway. It began with a dreamy parade of cotton candy organza cut into minidresses, rompers, and jumpsuits with darling ruffles. But then, like Anakin becoming Lord Vader, the show turned to the dark side. There was familiar bad-girl wear, like a strapless catsuit, but also more sophisticated silhouettes, some bow blouses and tuxedos in all black, and long Lucite chains wrapped around necks with a wink-wink ball-and-chain effect. Fun, yes. Wearable? Not particularly.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""n68i4n""></div></div><p>Trend alert: Stuart isn't the only designer experimenting with translucent organza these days. But it remains an open question how much Stuart's young and young-at-heart fans, specifically, will enjoy stepping into the stiff, sheer silk. We hope her starlet clients remember to wear panties.</p></div>"
102,spring,2008,s2008,john-galliano,"In this year's international league of annoying show venues, John Galliano swept all the trophies. Who else could sit around in a planning meeting and think, <em>Hmm, there's a major rugby match in Paris on Saturday night. The police will be blocking off streets. So let's send the editors into the stadium just as the fans are coming out!</em> Whatever inspired him—whether malevolent mischief or pure ivory-tower obliviousness—the man had a lot of hard tap dancing to do to charm his platform-shod audience once they'd abandoned cars and scrummed down against the contra-flow of rugger spectators to gain access to an annex of the Stade Français.</p><p>Let's just say, Galliano was smart to field a good team of models to make up for it. They laid on a gamely dizzy performance of typical Galliano-esque high jinks, animating a kind of storyline that was taken from the cult documentary <em>Grey Gardens</em>. This tale of faded flapperdom and eccentric cat-loving aristocratic decay is one of the most hackneyed fashion references of recent times, but OK. At this stage in his career, Galliano is motoring on reinterpretations of his classics—all the inimitably light-handed things he does with thirties bias cutting, frills, and printed chiffonery—and it happens that this is a season in which that looks right. First, there were twenties baby-star short tiered dresses, picture hats, and flounced jackets. Then a segue into demented Little Edie head-swathed cardigan looks, and a cat-fur-sprouting chubby to make the theme obvious. Otherwise, though, the narrative wasn't a groundbreaker, merely a device for trotting out Galliano¿s standard pretty, printed, flouncy dresses and some softened, sexy versions of the forties suits and day frocks he's been sending out recently at his Dior day job. All extramural irritation apart, it worked as proof that, trend-wise, Galliano is still in the game.</p></div>"
103,spring,2008,s2008,jonathan-saunders,"After receiving a positive response from American customers who understand his chic-modern take on certain things, Jonathan Saunders is limbering up to cross the Atlantic next season. London's loss will be New York's gain. A designer who started off in print, Saunders has accelerated to the point where he's defined a cleanliness of line and flair for color that can stand on its own on the buying floors of the best stateside stores.</p><p>This collection had those qualities studded through it. Saunders had, in part, been inspired by the Memphis Group's Ettore Sottsass, and that gave a logic to the color-blocking, banding, and ribbed knitwear, as well as to the distinctive eighties-Italian palette of dulled-pastel pinks, yellows, blues, and beige, set against black. Shapewise, it worked best when he stuck close to the body, in sleeveless, buttonless coats wrapped over crinkle-textured dresses—believable looks that came nearest to relating to the lives of grown-up, earning women. He wavered when asymmetric meringuelike tunics and abstract pleating started to interrupt silhouettes. At night, though, Saunders was back on the kind of form that Americans love. His narrow, floor-length T-shirt gown, a pink-bibbed column halter, and a white chiffon, edged in black and belted, again demonstrated his potential appeal for women looking for an alternative to the regular event uniform.</p></div>"
104,spring,2008,s2008,jovovich-hawk,"Milla Jovovich and Carmen Hawk bustled to and fro in the Hotel Chelsea, cracking jokes and pulling pieces from the racks to draw attention to some hand-sewn detail. They showed their collection by private appointment only, taking visitors over the course of two days—a sensible decision in this overbooked fashion week. And the Chelsea, which is clinging onto its shabby glamour even as developers circle, was a good setting for their Spring theme: lingerie.</p><p>Innerwear as outerwear is hardly breaking news, but this was something a bit different, an amusing review of boudoir dressing through the ages. A white silk Empire column evoked Empress Josephine's dressing gown; a beaded and embroidered capelet represented Victoriana; a powder blue tap-pants-and-bed-jacket set was very forties-Hollywood starlet; and printed chiffon teddies came straight out of the Cold War closet.</p><p>""We've taken the bedroom into the streets, but tried not to be too literal about it,"" Jovovich said. Actually, they were pretty literal about it. That's the thing about Jovovich-Hawk: The clothes are often authentic enough to be virtual reproductions. If you want to bring these pieces up to date, you have to style them into modernity…by pairing them, for instance, with this season's jeans, shorts, and minidresses, which were scattered throughout the suite.</p></div>"
105,spring,2008,s2008,junya-watanabe,"The gauzy, drape-y beauty of Junya Watanabe's Spring collection adds something relaxed to the current dialogue about vivid color, goddess dressing, and flower prints. Somehow, without being remotely pedestrian, each of his bunchy wrapped dresses, whipped around the body out of one seamless piece of tablecloth linen—bright pink, followed by lime, cobalt, and cerulean blue—made summer dressing seem, for the first time this season, beautifully effortless.</p><p>Using simple materials tethered to bands of utilitarian tape, Watanabe created shapes that wound asymmetrically here and there, baring the back or dipping off the shoulder. A man of few words, the only clue he gave afterward about his starting point was, ""It all goes back to Africa."" In retrospect, you could see what he meant, but, as with so many collections these days, it's not so much the conceptual origin that matters—only whether the designer transforms it into something a woman can imagine wearing. On that score, this collection delivered a rare sequence of delightful surprises.</p><p>After the drapery, Watanabe worked in superbright ruched chiffon jackets with pocket detailing edged in strips of gold lace—Coco-like in front, but crafted into scrolled eighteenth-century peplums in the back. Following that, he tackled the flowers, making bloused smocks in forties-influenced tea-dance prints, then breaking out into classic arts-and-crafts Liberty-print tan lawn cotton dresses. Suffice to say, it amounted to one of the season's most sensitive interpretations of overground trend from an underground source—experimental, yet never deviating from Watanabe's recognizable signatures.</p></div>"
106,spring,2008,s2008,just-cavalli,"In a season of riffs on Balenciaga's directional Fall collection, leave it to Cavalli to come up with the most flamboyant one. His multiprint patchwork dresses were inspired by Africa and came with Masai beaded necklines or loose strands of fringe. But the quilted silk jackets, waist-carving belts with feather skirts attached, and ballooning pants looked a little too familiar for comfort.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Just Cavalli show without some sex. So there were motocross jackets and pants, the former in patches of black, white, and brightly hued leather (matching the show's opening ethnic print), the latter in curve-hugging racing-car green. Fuchsia abstract leopard-print jersey also added a vixenish element, especially when it was spliced and pieced back together as a skintight micro-minidress. His daring maillots came with cutouts at the side or in strips of ribbon that looked knitted together like ribs. They were reminders that, when it comes to his diffusion line, Cavalli ought to have enough proven signatures of his own to riff on without looking elsewhere.</p></div>"
107,spring,2008,s2008,karen-walker,"Eccentricity has a precarious relationship with the fashion industry, particularly in commercially driven New York. But Karen Walker, now in her third season here, has built a solid business on her singular, cheery-but-subversive brand of sartorial whimsy. To wit, she considered adding classic styles to her popular line of eyewear before deciding to just give 'em nothing but big and bold. The result: multiple reorders at Barneys. The lesson: To thine own self be true.</p><p>For Spring, Walker spun a tale that wove through the garden party of a kooky-chic neighbor before winding up on the track at Churchill Downs—the latter being the result of watching the Marx Brothers classic <em>A Day at the Races</em>, as well as of a longtime obsession with jockeys. ""They've always been in my book of things I'd like to do a collection about,"" the designer explained after the show. As is often the case with Walker, it all made charming sense in the execution. There was a real freshness to thirties-style floral tea dresses and seventies-style wide-legged pants topped with floppy hats, knotted scarves, and Rachel Zoe-worthy sunglasses. From the racecourse, Walker took jodhpurs, zippered jackets, and bobbled caps, transforming them into kicky, tomboyish looks that fulfilled both the sporty and gender-bending quotas that seem to be requirements in a Walker affair. The designer also turned the graphic silks of a jockey's uniform into polka-dot shifts and harlequin blouses. Amidst this mélange was a pair of understated black dresses; even eccentrics need a day off now and then.</p></div>"
108,spring,2008,s2008,karl-lagerfeld,"The invite featured a prominent rainbow on one side, a motif that was echoed on the runway's neon-lit backdrop and the venue's benches. Did that mean we were in for a change chez Lagerfeld? Well, not exactly. The designer started, as usual, with sharp black and white tailoring, as exemplified by the graphic, fitted jackets and vests worn—with skinny pants and tulle-covered jeans, respectively—by Gemma and Snejana. Also in this category were fit-and-flare fifties dresses with geometric cutouts at the neckline, and a high-neck sleeveless blouse and a billowy frock that looked not unlike Lagerfeld's own monastic shirts.</p><p>The show's other idea—body-con jersey dressing—is where the bright hues came in, and it introduced an element of sexiness that the designer doesn't often explore in this line. But count on Lagerfeld to add a layer of intrigue. Veilings of black mesh crisscrossed the body, echoing the more angular shapes of his tailoring. After dark, he laid on the sequins and crystals—in horizontal stripes across a thick-strapped little black dress, for example. The takeaway message? There wasn't one, necessarily. This is a collection, in essence, of pieces, and the best thing about it was the increased variety.</p></div>"
109,spring,2008,s2008,katy-rodriguez,"How many designers could boast that costumer Arianne Phillips (<em>3:10 to Yuma</em>, <em>Walk the Line</em>) styled their debut show, that Mark Seliger (<em>Vanity Fair</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em>) was there to shoot pictures, or that music from PJ Harvey's to-be-released album played on the soundtrack? Only one.</p><p>Those new to the two-year-old line might expect retro looks from Rodriguez, the well-connected co-owner of the high-end vintage mecca Resurrection. But actually ""modern and dynamic"" was her goal, she said backstage as Tara Subkoff, Matt Damhave, Waris Ahluwalia, Jessica Joffe, and Neuromance's Cynthia Mittweg milled around.</p><p>Those in the know will have recognized a few of Rodriguez's conceits from previous outings, but there was some news, too. Figure-hugging sheaths resonated with the body-con feeling of the season. Swingy, coquettish dresses with cheery polka dots hit her target of ""fun, festive, and bright."" Le Smoking looks closed the show. Rodriguez could have spread her wings a little farther, though. There was a lingering suspicion that the collection didn't merit a runway show so much as an in-crowd party at which to shine.</p></div>"
110,spring,2008,s2008,kris-van-assche,"After a few earnest but flawed seasons in the menswear arena, Kris Van Assche just might be proving that womenswear—his original ambition, as it turns out—is what serves his talents best. An expressed desire to ""keep things small"" meant there was no big show, no leaden theme, to weigh down his third effort on the women's side: It was just a simple presentation of 25 looks, with six models. The designer's launchpad was, as usual, elements from his menswear, with a feminine spin. Swiss cotton shirtings were reconfigured as almost sheer shorts or trousers. Piqué was cut into a neat little jacket. The silk of a tie was used as banding on a full black skirt. And a shawl-collared tuxedo vest was revealingly slashed from stem to stern in the back.</p><p>Van Assche's love of all things Latin American also helped feminize the look. Frida Kahlo was referenced in the emphatic eyebrows and slicked-back, orchid-adorned hair (and in the parrot motif embroidered on crisp cottons that could otherwise double as bedsheets). Elsewhere, the designer did pretty well at sublimating such an obvious influence. Mexico provided the sulfurous yellow, sky blue, acid orange, and Catholic white of his palette; it also echoed in the floor-sweeping silk skirts and in the elasticized necklines and tied waists of voluminous smocks. But irrespective of those touches, the collection could be read, simply, as a contemporary take on slouchy ease. Case in point: Van Assche likes to put pockets in everything, even the most billowing skirt, so hands always have a place to hide.</p></div>"
111,spring,2008,s2008,l-a-m-b-,"Gwen Stefani was back on the runway tonight after a two-year absence. She spent most of that time caring for a newborn and touring the world, but somewhere along the line she got serious about fashion, too. Her debut, for those with short memories, was nothing short of cacophonous—one part Orange County <em>chola</em> girl, another part Rasta, to the tune of <em>The Sound of Music</em>. This show was far more harmonious. Stefani's references are still rooted in sound, specifically the ska bands that were an early inspiration for her group No Doubt. But the collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone who grew up in the eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend.</p><p>Highlights included a fitted green sweater and long checked pencil skirt punctuated by a wide, bright-yellow belt; a short shift in gray leopard-print sequins over a matching bow-front silk blouse; and a black-and-white picnic-plaid strapless dress with a swirling skirt. If some of it—a one-shoulder dress encased in black mesh, for instance—resembled what we saw on last season's runways, so be it. All of it looked like Stefani. For the legions of fans who attend her sold-out shows and make her L.A.M.B. bags such hot eBay commodities, there's no better advertisement.</p></div>"
112,spring,2008,s2008,l-wren-scott,"There was a roomful of happy faces at L'Wren Scott's Gagosian Gallery show. Not an easy feat for the last day of fashion week. And it was more than just the bento boxes and sake—or the sighting of Scott's beau, Mick Jagger—that had people smiling. This longtime stylist-turned-designer's clothes are steamy, sharply tailored, and, even better, trend-free.</p><p>She opened with a trio of long sweeping coats, worn with matchstick-skinny jeans and trilbies angled just so. From there, she dabbled in daywear, showing fitted blazers, cropped to graze the hips, and a pair of body-loving dresses—one with bracelet sleeves, the other boatnecked and sleeveless. Scott, of course, has made her reputation dressing celebrities for the red carpet, so eveningwear of a get-me-noticed sort was the bigger focus. Working in black, many shades of blue, and nothing else, she scored with a whippet-thin suit in allover sequins, a stretch-satin cocktail dress topped by a directional cape, and an hourglass gown that had a sweetheart neckline edged in netting and a cascade of tiered ruffles at the back.</p><p>Now in her fourth season and feeling confident, the designer mixed it up. A short lace dress and a sleek zip-front jumpsuit added a sexy, and refreshingly personal, rock 'n' roll edge. Credit Scott for ending fashion week on a positive note.</p></div>"
113,spring,2008,s2008,la-perla,"We all know La Perla is a lingerie company. So why does Alessandro Dell'Acqua, who quietly designs the label's ready-to-wear collection, feel the need to constantly remind us of the fact?</p><p>Two looks, in particular, from the Spring show stand out for their gimmickry. The first was an otherwise innocuously pretty trapeze dress in lavender-and-gray chiffon, topped by a strapless nude-mesh bra. The second was a feather-bustier cocktail dress trussed up with exposed whaleboning in a snakeskin print. But those weren't the only pieces that were overthought: High-tech holographic fabrics were decorated with incongruous baroque soutache embroideries, while feathers edged not only the bustlines of evening numbers but also the hems of cropped jackets. As for the swimsuits, with all their superfluous straps, they were just fetish-y.</p><p>When Dell'Acqua exercised a bit of restraint, things looked up. A navy silk mikado dress that tented to the knees and was topped by an unadorned short-sleeve jacket was ladylike and sophisticated. A slouchy white pullover sweater added an offhand, cool element to an allover-feathered skirt. More ease, less tease, please.</p></div>"
114,spring,2008,s2008,lacoste,"For Spring, Christophe Lemaire dispensed with the gimmicks of recent seasons and, in the process, showed he does have what it takes to update a classic. Lacoste is fêting its 75th anniversary, and the creative director started his show off with a trip to the company's birthplace: 1930's Basque country. Working almost exclusively in white, with red and black trims, he kept things simple, fresh, and of course sporty. He sent out pleat-skirted tennis dresses; a long, gauzy, belted djellaba; and a sack skirt in terrycloth—accessorizing these looks with wide-brimmed straw hats and platform espadrilles.</p><p>In a middle section reminiscent of the washed-out photos of David Hamilton, Lemaire transitioned to the sun-bleached seventies. This season's ubiquitous high-waisted wide-leg pant was done in a sun-faded denim. That same fabric made up a simple tunic, worn over a sliver of a bikini bottom, and a sleeveless dress, left mostly unbuttoned for a leggy informality. There followed a final grouping that was bright, graphic, and nautical in feel, featuring stripes and large polka dots inspired by marine flags. Altogether, this was a strong showing, and it suggested that, at 75, the company is in rude good health.</p></div>"
115,spring,2008,s2008,lanvin,"For lightness, technical brilliance, and sheer heart-racing excitement, Alber Elbaz's Spring collection was one of the most uplifting shows of the entire season. On a breeze, with nothing much more than a twist of polyester to hand, he captured fluidity, color, practicality, and a soaring kind of simplicity that caused a visceral response in every woman watching. To begin with, he brought the principles of goddess dressing to daywear, putting knee-length draped dresses under light, matching flyaway trenches in city-sober (yet utterly stunning) navy or khaki—Madame Grès gone techno. Elbaz's stand-alone dresses were masterpieces of cutting—seamless spirals, flowing trapezes, cool shifts magicked out of single lengths of material with maybe just a belt or a gathered drawstring for detail. ""I have no words for it,"" he said, humbly. ""I only wanted to start from instinct.""</p><p>Few words, indeed, are equal to describing the drama of the pleated dresses that ballooned into airborne trains in movement—one each in cobalt, green, yellow, and red—or the embellishment. Pale ostrich plumes worked their way up the front of a white chiffon sheath, puffing upward to one shoulder and tethered to the body with a weighty pearl-and-enamel pendant. Patches of crystal and feather embroidery, almost African, were worked into intensely patterned shimmy dresses fit for a modern Josephine Baker. And the color kept on exploding on the retina: magenta, teal, red, coral, purple. By the finale parade, Elbaz had covered tux dressing, togas, shirts, pencil skirts, and even some of the season's best fluid pants. When he came out to take his bow, there was a roar of applause from the audience—recognition that this triumph was Elbaz's best Lanvin collection to date, and a celebration that, at long last, someone had come up with the insight to make a collection that is about enhancing the quality of women's lives today.</p></div>"
116,spring,2008,s2008,lela-rose,"""Katharine Hepburn meets Audrey Hepburn,"" is how Rose described her Spring look. What, exactly, does that mean? A new sportiness, for starters. The show's standout piece was a bottle-green belted taffeta anorak coat-dress—hardly a new concept, but one that added a peppy zip to the other, more elegant, fare. The same silhouette topped a strapless, floor-length dress with embroidery at the hem, just the thing for a black-tie garden party.</p><p>The Katharine part of the concept meant more pants than usual on her runway. Rose called them knickers, cut them in cotton canvas or dungaree twill full to just below the knee, and paired them with long tanks or tunics. Audrey came forward in the form of a sweetly feminine day dress in a subtle polka dot; and, for evening, slim, skimming cocktail numbers in Matisse-bright silks with scalloped hems.</p><p>Rose loves texture. She experimented this season by layering corded or pinwheel lace over linen sackcloth in contrasting colors. ""How do you make burlap couture?"" was the challenge behind a strapless persimmon-and-ginger number. It¿s the sort of High WASP, lo-fi concept that would have appealed to Kate the Great and, very likely, will to the swans of Park Avenue.</p></div>"
117,spring,2008,s2008,limi-feu,"""She made it,"" declared a beaming Yohji Yamamoto after his daughter Limi's Paris debut. And papa had every reason to be proud: The collection was a walking advertisement for fashion DNA. You could tell Limi is daddy's girl by the use of volume, layering, asymmetry, and the monochromatic navy-and-white palette. (Even those squashy top hats had the tang of vintage Yohji.) But this particular chip off the old block has her own row to hoe. <em>Feu</em> means fire, and there's a lot of fight in Limi. From the models' bouffant shag hairdos to the strappy boots, she worked the rock attitude expressed in her own tattoos.</p><p>That was the crucial departure from Yohji's work: If he can only imagine such a girl, Limi <em>is</em> that girl. And it gave, for example, her cropped navy bomber over a long asymmetrical white jersey top a punky zest. But this wasn't plain old tattooed toughness, either. Limi chopped the shoulders out of jackets and the thighs out of trousers, offering artful glimpses of skin but also amplifying a kind of airiness you don't often associate with the family oeuvre. She laid sheer fabric over a full white skirt here, deconstructed a gold knit tunic over a flared skirt there. These volumes may hark back to her father's fascination with Edwardiana, but the idea looked quite seductive in a puff-sleeved trenchcoat-dress. And she scored with her models, too: Predominantly Japanese, they were a welcome respite from this season's never-ending march of the robot blondes.</p></div>"
118,spring,2008,s2008,louis-vuitton,"""It all came from our collaboration with Richard Prince, who is an artist who appropriates references within his work, which is what we do—which is fine, so long as there are three differences in everything!"" declared Marc Jacobs, in the push and shove of the media mayhem backstage at Louis Vuitton. ""And I'm a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants—and for all I know, so is Rei Kawakubo, because that's where our color came from!"" Phew. If you take the decoder to that rush of explanation, it might take all night, but essentially what you have is Jacobs' defense against critics who skewered his New York show last month as derivative, especially of Comme des Garçons.</p><p>Pulling in Richard Prince for this season's Louis Vuitton project was a typical Jacobs coup of multidimensional, referential, and self-referential significance. The artist's spray painting and texts were worked into LV bags, recalling the hit collaboration with Takashi Murakami. Prince's body of work also triggered a rerun of the 12 Carita-uniformed girls who opened that Murakami show, but this time, they were sexy nurses in see-through plastic coats—Stephanie Seymour, Eva Herzigova, Nadja Auermann, and Naomi Campbell among them. That hilariously kinky parade was inspired by Prince's Nurse paintings—one of which appeared on a Sonic Youth album cover, which again links back to Jacobs' family circle of personal reference.</p><p>The collection? It was a reconfirmation, in less extreme form, of the controversial show with which Jacobs kicked off the season in New York, full of nutty combinations of fabric and garish SpongeBob pastels. The Lurex knits, pencil skirts, and gazar trenches came in mauve, yellow, pink, and purple, with deconstructed fragments of pinstripe vests, tweed suiting, and goddess-y chiffon fused into the mix. It was crazed, random, playful—yet grounded, as always, in bottom-line business sense. To see that, you only had to focus on the shoes—pointy pumps with bows and sparkles in the toe—and a new chunky line of costume jewelry. It's Jacobs' way of walking the line between creative freedom and commercial innovation.</p></div>"
119,spring,2008,s2008,louise-goldin,"It takes some oomph to extract sex, power, color, and hard-core fashion values out of a knitting machine, but Louise Goldin has it in spades. Making no apologies for knits as chilly summer evening cover-ups, she sent out a body-conscious, vibrant collection modeled by a team of girls who looked like they were about to dive into some sort of cyber-age swim championship.</p><p>There was so much going on in their dresses, hoodies, rompers, tunics, and bodysuits that it was hard to keep pace. Apart from the orange, cyclamen, turquoise, green, purple, and white, there were stripes, checkerboards, transparent bands, ruching, papery creases, and ruffles as fine and fluttery as tropical-fish fins. For a first solo collection from a young designer who has just emerged from the Fashion East collective (via Central Saint Martins), that was quite a convincing score.</p><p>Afterward, Goldin explained her mission to make knitwear count for something a bit more exciting than a standby cardigan: ""I've freelanced in Brazil, so I know how knits can work for summer. I love it when I can put six colors into a machine and make something amazing come out,"" she said. ""I want to push knitwear to a future vision."" She's on her way.</p></div>"
120,spring,2008,s2008,luca-luca,"Luca Orlandi boarded the translucence train that is currently making all local stops down Seventh Avenue. Organdy and chiffon are everywhere, and Orlandi wanted to explore transparency, too. He was inspired in this endeavor, he said, by the luminous panels of stained glass.</p><p>The collection was full of body-skimming dresses in gauzy, milky sherbet colors. After an almost blindingly blingy Fall, this lineup was thankfully lower key. Instead of beading, he worked with texture: skinny ruffles snaking down the seams of a chiffon dress or the crocheted silk banding on the waist of a gown. Elsewhere he used subtle embroideries. When he did embellish more boldly, he was in experimental mode. A sea-foam chiffon dress had vertical pleats that played hide-and-seek with the beaded sparkle underneath. Another shift with pleated taffeta squares used the same peekaboo trick.</p><p>It's well established that the ladies love Luca. The social contingent in this season's front row included Ivanka Trump, Tinsley Mortimer, Bettina Zilkha, and Coralie Charriol Paul. They got what they came for: lovely dresses for lunches at Le Bilboquet and La Goulue. But even his fans might have appreciated a bit more freshness. Aside from the touch of whimsy provided by a scarf print of pearls, there was little here to shake things up when the clock strikes one on Madison Avenue.</p></div>"
121,spring,2008,s2008,luella,"Taking over Claridge's ballroom, Luella Bartley brought her collection back to London in a one-off pop-up show coinciding with the opening of her first store on Brook Street. ""It was about Thora Birch in <em>Ghost World</em>. A bit geeky and cartoonish,"" the designer said, as her nanny deposited her toddler on her hip and her husband, the photographer David Sims, kept baby number two distracted near the racks; number three, newly born, had a prior engagement. Bartley had just shown a cute, ultra-commercial collection of fifties Americana-meets-English punky references.</p><p>The things she did with tiny Liberty-style florals were an object lesson in how to contradict sweet with street. She dip-dyed the hem of a print dress, put military epaulets on a shift, turned the florals into a flounced ""batwoman"" cape flowing from the shoulders, and plasticized them to make a sixties dolly-bird mac. A green plaid Peter Pan-collared dress faithful to Birch in the 2001 film; a sharp, shiny mohair pantsuit; and a funny twinset with a bat logo on the breast stood out, although they had tough competition from the accessories. Luella's new bags are giant navy patent totes and orange see-through plastic shoppers, and she's been letting herself loose with plastic-poppy hair ornaments, too.</p><p>All in all, it was a grand demonstration of the evolution of Luella Bartley, the brattish British designer who left to show her collection in New York and came back polished up as the homecoming queen of bankable product.</p></div>"
122,spring,2008,s2008,luisa-beccaria,"With a Mediterranean garden party as a theme, this was another of Luisa Beccaria's typical pretty party-dress collections. There were many options from which to choose—from the understated (black eyelet and pastel chiffons) to the witty (a fruit-basket print for sundresses, oversize gingham for a fitted sheath) to the overly literal (a few numbers interwoven with natural raffia). For evening, a romantic rose-photo-print mermaid gown with shirring at the bodice stood out among solid hues like periwinkle, emerald green, and lemon yellow.</p><p>The designer is intimately familiar with this terrain. (Her family home in Sicily has no doubt hosted a garden party or two.) She may be too familiar, in fact, as her collections are in danger of becoming formulaic. When she veered from the predictable—as she did with a couture-grade orange silk short-sleeve cocoon coat that topped an accordion-pleated dress, an apricot chiffon scarf tied around the model's neck for extra chic value—pens started scribbling in the front row. Next time, she'd be smart to pack her collection with more such surprises.</p></div>"
123,spring,2008,s2008,maison-martin-margiela,"Something sexy this way comes: bodies, bandeau tubes, tight graphic stripes. As a take on body-con and the smooth, attenuated silhouette, Margiela's was one of the sharpest and least retro versions on offer. His revisionist working of the possibilities of cling-fit stretch created a whole new look, but how to describe it? Put together from abbreviated, horizontally banded beige and black body pieces, it was part swim, part foundation garment, with matched armbands and the occasional trompe l'oeil bicolored stocking-legging added to give total coverage.</p><p>Later on, Margiela introduced a clever way of layering fluidity into the picture, making flyaway, cutaway pieces to shrug over shoulders, or skirts that were short in front and long in back (or vice versa)—a modernist underground alternative to the floaty chiffonery that's surfaced in the mainstream. That segued into a passage of “vestigial” accessories—a couple of dresses with shoulder bags hilariously implanted at the armpit, and 3-D fabric buckles standing in place of belts. That train of thought—the ""ghosts"" of garments—also led Margiela to shred denim to become fringed pelmets or ultra-tattered jeans under jackets with vast, pointy shoulders. Was this a convergence with the rising interest in Americana that's bubbling up in so many other collections? Probably, yes: For evening, there were reinterpretations of a “found” fantasy Western photo-print T-shirt, made into bustier dresses. In all, there was plenty to think about from one of the most innovative designers in Paris.</p></div>"
124,spring,2008,s2008,malo,"""Where's the knitwear?"" one editor wondered aloud as yet another elaborately beaded coat came down the runway. For three seasons, this famed Italian cashmere company has been staging fashion shows in New York; since 2006, the collection has been designed by Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi (who show their 6267 line in Milan)—all of which demonstrates that some sort of rebranding is afoot.</p><p>Clearly, the line is centered not so much on yarn as on luxury, pure and simple. While many New York designers have gone on vicarious safari this season, the Italian duo took an imaginary voyage in another direction: to the Far East. They returned with both directly imported concepts (beautifully beaded Asian medallions) and more subtle translations (cheongsam-shaped hoodies, robe jackets, yarns with cores of pure gold). Silken ""jog"" pants and jumpsuits added timely sporty and sexy seventies references to the accomplished, if somewhat repetitive, doings.</p><p>There's no question these clothes are well made. And the duo obviously has a real feel for texture—as their Rasta knits proved last season, and as skirts that looked as if they were constructed out of silken Chinese knots did this one. The ultimate destination of the brand, however, remains TBD.</p></div>"
125,spring,2008,s2008,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"It's always a challenge to pull out the theme from a Marc by Marc Jacobs show, what with all the layers and the mad piles of accessories. But if you had to peg his collection of shirtdresses, corduroy pantsuits, and color-blocked coats and jackets—much of it decorated in shiny gold buttons and hardware—to something, it could easily be Pan Am stewardesses, by way of Mary Tyler Moore. OK, that's two things. See? Put simply, the show was studiously retro, from the air-hostess hats right down to the two-tone patent-leather loafers.</p><p>The thing that saved it from seeming like a trip to Screaming Mimi's was the way Jacobs integrated elements of his signature collection, shown the previous evening. Those deconstructed suits and evening dresses with superfluous appendages were translated here into, say, a trench with an extra front panel in a contrasting color, or a jersey-knit dress with one long sleeve and the other not only short but also in a clashing quilted-cotton fabric. All that is not to say there weren't plenty of pieces you could actually see yourself wearing, like an olive cotton-drill shirtdress or a polka-dot dress with voluminous skirts. Then there were the groovy accessories: The Lego belt buckles were a clever idea, but it's the patent lady bags and square clutches that will make the bucks.</p></div>"
126,spring,2008,s2008,marc-jacobs,"At 11 p.m., precisely two hours after his official starting time, Marc Jacobs surprised his audience by running out onto his Stefan Beckman-designed set for a quick bow. Next came the music, Ravel's <em>Boléro</em>, and out filed the models in finale formation. Then here was the first girl (or rather the last, because by now it was clear this extraordinary show was unspooling backward, starting with look 56 and running down to one). She wore a ""silly-string guipure gown,"" her satin under-things peeking out and her heels perched on top of her ""too-small pumps."" Behind her, an image of the model in nothing but the bra and panties she wore underneath her outfit was projected on two large screens.</p><p>Jacobs collaborated with the video artist Charles Atlas to create the film that played simultaneously with the show. They shot the piece Sunday evening, and Atlas spent the whole night in the editing booth finishing it. As for the clothes and accessories, they were just as off-kilter and knock-your-socks-off as the production, with a bonkers surrealist streak. Trompe l'oeil underwear decorated georgette slipdresses, the heels of pumps protruded not from the heel at all but from the ball of the foot, and three-dimensional quilted leather bags were grafted onto square totes. Transparency was a key theme, too: Cashmere sweaters were inset with sheer panels at the waist, and reconstructed black bugle-bead evening dresses came suspended from their nude linings. Gimmicky? You bet. But also fascinating. If you want normal or tame, you're going to have to look on a different runway. Even the suits came with hip-high slits—though, this being Jacobs, the effect was just as often gawky and awkward as it was provocative.</p><p>So what was it all about? With most of the models in varying stages of dishabille, Jacobs appeared to be saying something conceptual about the process of getting dressed—or getting undressed—but he was typically vague backstage. ""It's cartoon versions of all the women I know—conservative types, vamps, everybody,"" he allowed. From the looks of two number-emblazoned team-jersey T-shirt dresses that appeared on his runway, there are footballers' wives in the designer's inner circle along with all of those rockers and artists. One thing's for certain: He's moved on from last season's bourgeois austerity. This sublime performance was about sex, which is one of the reasons why we couldn't look away.</p></div>"
127,spring,2008,s2008,marchesa,"There was new mom Naomi Watts making her way through the crowded Chelsea gallery space, but Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig's assured Spring collection showed the duo moving away from the red-carpet territory in which they made their reputation. Yes, they trotted out a few paparazzi-friendly pastel gowns with crystal-beaded bodices. More intriguing, however, to the fashion watchers in the room were the cocktail-hour options—like a tiny corset dress that sparkled at the sides, a bateau-neck lace number with a plunging back, and a flapper-esque tank in white beads with a gray ribbon belt. A black lace jacket and navy georgette-satin camisole worn with matching pleat-front pants stood out in the roomful of bare legs.</p><p>Color was also key. ""We looked at the British Raj, the fusion of Indian and Victorian England culture,"" said Craig. ""When we decided to launch Marchesa four-and-a-half years ago, we were in India."" A shocking-pink dress with a cutout back was hand-encrusted with miniature mirrors. Less literal were a pair of strapless styles, one short and one blossoming in tiers to the floor, with heavy gold beading. With Chapman's beau, Harvey Weinstein, the new owner of Halston, Marchesa's profile keeps rising. Happily, so do the duo's ability and ambition.</p></div>"
128,spring,2008,s2008,marios-schwab,"There's always been something in the sharpness of Marios Schwab's cut that puts you in mind of scalpels and the hand-eye coordination of a surgeon. That latent interest in the science of the body rose fully to the surface in his Spring collection. From his first dress—a T-shirt shift with a thermo-image of body-generated heat in front and a digital print of something organic on the arms—it was apparent that ""body-conscious"" was about to go somewhere the late eighties never delved: under the skin.</p><p>But before the squeamish send up the red flags, let's pretend we haven't been informed about Schwab's fascination with early anatomical dissection manuals and microphotography of bone and viscera. Scrub that prior knowledge, and what's left is a collection of scrolled-back, sculptural black body braces over lovely pink-, yellow-, and black-hued fluid prints: modern things that are young, strong, and feminine all at the same time. These were followed by a multitude of dresses, some in draped jersey, others in fluttery silk, that mark a distinct move toward prettiness, as well as a more forgiving fit. One such dress had a stunning back view, in which a jacket was elegantly sliced open to reveal a zipper spine and black pearls denoting ribs beneath. Others came with external body jewelry derived from internal structures of veins and nerves, though never to shock effect. As a creamy crinkled dress, delicately strung over with pearls, left the runway, it was clear that Schwab had managed to sublimate all of his academic research into something that could really add to the sum of joy of smart, young womanhood.</p></div>"
129,spring,2008,s2008,marni,"Marni has evolved into a staple formula that has moved from the eccentric margins to become one of the brands upon which Italy's pride as a style leader rests. Consuelo Castiglioni's taste in arty textiles, lately sharpened up with an injection of shiny techno surfaces, is absorbed by the mainstream within nanoseconds—a double-edged compliment many designers would kill for. How's she reacting to that pressure? Apparently by blanking it.</p><p>Instead of rushing forward, Castiglioni took the don't-mess-with-success approach for Spring. Her easy-on-the-body loose-waisted shifts with their wonky-but-right abstract gathers and tucks have been seen before, though each merits praise as a one-off canvas for an exceptional print. This time, the color register ran through forest-y and watery greens to purple, mustard, grays, browns, cornflower and iris blues—only interrupted by a short blast of fluorescent orange somewhere in the middle. That inevitably drew the restless eye to seek out the things that are different in this collection. Qualifiers in that category were the stark white dress with plastic stones implanted in the neckline, cute petaled cone hats, tinsel bags, and the sharp half-moon sunglasses, which might jolt the market for giant face-covering shades in a new direction. Otherwise, Castiglioni didn't seem overly concerned with breaking too much new ground. That's sound from a brand-consistency point of view, though it slightly dashed the hopes of a crowd hungry for stop-the-press news out of Milan.</p></div>"
130,spring,2008,s2008,martin-grant,"A tuxedo and a strapless gown, gift-wrapped with a bow at the waist, both in shocking pink, were the highlights, showcasing Martin Grant's twin talents for sharp yet feminine tailoring and dressmaking with a couturier's attention to detail. You could even call these items classics—chez Grant, that's not a naughty word.</p><p>Other pieces that fit the description included a single-button, double-breasted leather jacket with a stand-up collar and furled lapels; a blouson shirtdress with oversize buttons, tied waist, and corded cap sleeves; and a long silver dress with a narrow column of a skirt and a gathered bodice that draped from rolled shoulders. The last two had a subtle Asian sensibility that was echoed in the models' ironed and upswept hair. A brown-and-pink floral dress was more of-the-moment, but still well within the designer's elegant vocabulary.</p><p>Points off, though, for the patent short shorts. One pair sends a message about a sportif summer; many pairs suggest that Grant didn't work hard enough to come up with more viable below-the-waist options.</p></div>"
131,spring,2008,s2008,matthew-williamson,"A behatted Prince came late, sat down in the front row. Minutes later, his band filed out at the end of the catwalk and began to jam. Then his dancers Maya and Nandy McClean did their wanton hoochie koo, until they were joined by the singer's statuesque muse, Chelsea Rodgers. The only thing missing was the man himself. Would he? Could he? Ah, he could! He did! Left his seat, picked up his guitar, and played.</p><p>How did Matthew Williamson's Spring show come to begin with a performance by Prince? Chelsea is apparently a big Williamson fan, so her Svengali <em>asked</em> if he could open. That's not the only fortuitous thing that's happened to Matt from the Midlands lately. His company has just been infused with cash from a pair of investment funds, so there was understandably a heightened level of confidence on the catwalk, once Prince had returned to his seat, the audience had regained its composure, and the clothes began to appear.</p><p>The story was the (by now) familiar one of a stylish nomad traveling around the world with one bag (though, FYI, Williamson's windfall is allowing him to expand his accessories range). The conceit gave the designer the excuse to ladle on his signature ethnic details: Indian beads and pearls on a suede waistcoat, African raffia trim on a sequined top, a Mayan effect to the beading on a hessian shift, all enough to drive a magpie wild.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""xl78rm""></div></div><p>But that's scarcely anything new from Williamson. Maybe that's why the new confidence stood out best in the less gonzo girlie pieces—like the natural linens, or the silk blazers in blurry schoolboy stripes that had a batik-y flair. Better them than the mumsy muslin floor sweeper, one for the vestal virgin in all of us. It was a clunker even if it <em>was</em> hemmed in green sequins. Williamson managed a quick save with a finale of ruffled georgette party frocks. Now <em>that's</em> a girl he gets.</p></div>"
132,spring,2008,s2008,maurizio-pecoraro,"Maurizio Pecoraro's never been one to hold back his artier inclinations. Jackson Pollock, this time, was the source of the very literal abstract-expressionist purple-and-blue splatter print that appeared on an off-white pantsuit and was translated into 3-D embroidery on another jacket. There were shades of Rothko, too: In the finale, models wearing hand-painted silk dresses lined up in a tableau against large colored panels, forming a striking visual composition—undermined, somewhat, by the fact that Vera Wang plumbed Rothko's rich archive some seasons ago, and to more subtle effect.</p><p>That was the trouble with this collection. Pecoraro's artsy indulgences—for instance, Native American feather jewelry and a fringed suede poncho worn with, of all things, cuffed turquoise cotton trousers—got the better of him. If there's a link between modern art and American Indian costume, it's not an obvious one. There were some real, wearable clothes out there, like the pretty party dresses in this season's jewel tones, but the aesthetic disconnect proved distracting.</p></div>"
133,spring,2008,s2008,max-azria,"Reading Lubov and Max Azria's program notes before their candlelit show could have been perilous for any editor or retailer experiencing early-onset collections fatigue: The talk of ""dreamy silhouettes"" and ""intimate luxury,"" in such a darkened setting, could easily make a girl long for her bed.</p><p>Of course, no one would really begrudge the Azrias their boudoir theme. And aside from a few too-pajama-like pajama-party looks, it translated to a pretty parade of dresses in a lingerie-department palette of black, white, and nude. Delicate details like spaghetti straps and pintucking were derived from under-things; chunky, black platform sandals provided welcome grounding. The color-blocked and dip-dyed silks, however, felt like a dream we've had before.</p><p>Judging by the long stretch of fashion-loving socialites in the front row—Ivanka Trump (with her newspaper-publisher beau, Jared Kushner), Celerie Kemble, Zani Gugelmann, Coralie Charriol, Arden Wohl, and Fabiola Beracasa—the designing couple is energetically buffing MaxAzria's status as the luxurious jewel in their BCBG crown. But while Trump and co. must have certainly found a dress or two to borrow or buy, this emerald isn't quite polished to perfection yet.</p></div>"
134,spring,2008,s2008,max-mara,"MaxMara's designers read the memo about this season's trends—Japanese influences, deconstructed tailoring, jumpsuits, and pajama suits—then went off and did their own thing with them. What emerged took an early-eighties street-style turn: something from the moment when Comme des Garçons was new, Jean Paul Gaultier was emerging, and London's Buffalo Girls were dressing in an androgynous-rocker kind of way. It fits MaxMara's agenda to find a new raison d'être for a jacket, coat, and suit, of course—and this time the team worked it out by cutting jackets with volume in the back; making a gray pinstripe suit with a forties shoulder, nipped waist, and calf-length skirt; and paring back the neckline of a narrow belted trench. All this made sense, but the dippy-hemlined skirts à la Comme circa 1985 were a reference too clunky to look convincing.</p><p>As for the jumpsuits, well, MaxMara can claim to have been vindicated on that one. The house has been doing them for a couple of seasons already, and now, as so many others are piling in with them, MaxMara has switched its overalls from military khakis into black satin. Fair enough, but after that transition into glammier fabrication the impetus petered out. After all, how does a boy-girl dress for evening? Would she wear an ice blue charmeuse pajama suit? It was a question that left the show dangling on a bit of an odd note—like the hemline that had mysteriously been left hanging over one ankle.</p></div>"
135,spring,2008,s2008,mcq-alexander-mcqueen,"If you thought of Nadia Comaneci when you saw the red, blue, and silver-star leotard on the mannequin that greeted you at the Bowery Hotel, then you were on Alexander McQueen's wavelength. The Olympics were the designer's subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, theme for his secondary line, now in its fourth season. That meant a sporty green parka with a drawstring waist and patent racing stripes, a short-sleeve red ""warm-up"" shirt jacket worn with a coated-denim skirt, and a poster-print romper. Taken to extremes, it translated into a dress or a skirt with colorful plastic rings—à la the Olympic symbol—inserted between curving seams. Meanwhile, a number of pieces—sweater tank, button-down, and perforated-leather cape—were decorated with what could have been some of Keith Haring's more provocative squiggles.</p><p>In other words, it was edgy, but not pod-dress-and-leather-leggings edgy. Which means it pleases both McQueen and his retailers.</p></div>"
136,spring,2008,s2008,michael-kors-collection,"""We were looking at some fabulous advertising from the late seventies and early eighties for Virginia Slims and Charlie,"" said Michael Kors before his show. ""There was something about those women; they were very sexy, but sporty at the same time."" Kind of like the Kors woman. Come springtime, she'll need clothes for tennis at the club, lunch and a meeting in the city, cocktails, cruises, and galas, too. And today, on his runway, Kors had plenty of suggestions: He started with Lilly Pulitzer pastels, in stripes or Impressionist florals for the court and the beach, and tossed in a few of his beloved caftans before the show was over, this season in an oversize black-on-white flower print designed to complement white maillots with gold-chain straps. For the office, there were chic navy suitings and this season's must-have safari jacket paired with wide-leg trousers. After dark, his girls will have a few options: gold sequins, drapey black jersey, or fruity chiffons—as in guava, apricot, and apple.</p><p>With Olivia Newton-John's <em>Xanadu</em> on the speakers, the show could have become kitsch, but Kors leavened the frivolity with a healthy respect for classic cuts and silhouettes—and don't forget paper-thin cashmere, the building block of a smart spring wardrobe. In the battle between opulence and simplicity, Kors—when he's on solid form like this—wins.</p></div>"
137,spring,2008,s2008,missoni,"It's no heavy criticism to say that Missoni isn't a stadium-filling collection: It's a friendly-scale line of highly identifiable knits and prints that's been enjoying an extended second life since young girls got into the label's dresses. Missoni has a bit of this and a bit of that: short, long, zigzags, flowers, seventies-ish boho mirror embroidery, flowy eveningwear. All of it has a place in a sunny holiday setting, and just about any piece would make a girl stand out at a relaxed party on a summer evening. That would be particularly true of some of the strapless flowered silks on today's runway, or the quietly sexy printed scarf-dresses, or—for a more high-impact occasion—the golden sequined pieces bejeweled like something out of a Klimt painting. It's just that, to amplify the aura of specialness and individuality these clothes can possess, Missoni would do better to devise a more intimate way of showing them, rather than in a cavernous old-style Italian industry venue with raked seating, as they do. Which brings us back to the original observation.</p></div>"
138,spring,2008,s2008,miu-miu,"What do <em>Swan Lake</em> dancers, sumo wresters, a girl in a French-maid costume, Playboy Bunnies, and a Burning Man festivalgoer have in common? Not much, unless you're Miuccia Prada. For Spring, she said she was thinking about ""life as theater, and all the clichés of how people represent themselves in the world."" So, videos and photographs of these and numerous other characters were projected onto screens as her models wound their way through the baroque rooms of an Avenue Foch mansion.</p><p>As for the clothes themselves, they seemed to pull most inspiration from the ballerinas and the French maids on those screens. The silhouette was scandalously short. Fitted sleeveless blouses, some with inset bibs-cum-dickeys, blossomed out at the waistline as a tutu might and stopped just short of the upper thighs, where little-girl bloomers or a fitted mini were peeking out from underneath the top's hem. This look came in many variations—metallic lamés, tiny tiers of ruffles in black or cream, prim organza—and when Miuccia diverged from it, it was with a sculptural hip-length cape over silky short shorts or a multicolor striped jumpsuit that had echoes of her Prada show. Similarly, the illustrated harlequins and Pierrots that decorated brocades were relatives of the fairies at Miu Miu's big sister.</p><p>How does it all relate to the sheer, mumsy-ish polyester suits hanging in the label's stores now? In the sense that what we saw today was young and sexy, it doesn't. But the collection had this in common with last season's: It was subtly perverse (and given the kink factor, destined to divide opinion). At Miu Miu, that seems to be just the way Prada likes it.</p></div>"
139,spring,2008,s2008,monique-lhuillier,"With pastel visions of Ladurée macaroons dancing in her head, Lhuillier was in a sweet and delicate mood. ""I wanted to embrace femininity,"" she said after the show. In contrast with last season's set, which featured a giant architectural curl of brushed steel suspended over the runway, Spring's had a painted backdrop of porcelain flowers.</p><p>Lhuillier said she had found herself draping directly onto the dressmaker's form as she worked on the collection. And so there were cocktail frocks and evening gowns wrapped gently around the body, ending in asymmetrical necklines that were vaguely Grecian (but thankfully not overtly Grès). As is to be expected with a confectionary theme, there were sugary moments, including the frothy tulle looks and a tiered nude gown painted with tiny flowers. To her credit, these somehow weren't fussy.</p><p>The designer offered a few points of difference: a couple of requisite L.B.D.'s; slim, unembellished chiffon dresses in dusty colors; and the terrific big-night alternative of high-waisted black trousers and a ruffled blouse. Similarly simple was a fluid silk-jersey dress that approximated an ultrachic toga with an assymetrical flat-ribbon strap. Corsets were also part of the story, paired with high-waisted pencil skirts for day and adding structure to airy gowns for after eight.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""3sknag""></div></div><p>This was classic Lhuillier, and it underscored why she's an eveningwear presence to be reckoned with. Instead of tricks and just-for-the-runway gimmicks, she gave us uncomplicated elegance. The proceedings may have lacked a directional element, but in this case it was a forgivable sin.</p></div>"
140,spring,2008,s2008,moschino,"The Moschino girls stepped through the parted skirts of a giant, plaster eighteenth-century ball gown to stalk the runway, but if you were looking for clues as to where the collection would go, the backdrop was hardly a helpful hint. This wouldn't be a rococo romp (although there were a fair amount of bows—plastic, naturally, in the house's signature kitsch style). Instead, the main references seemed to be an unlikely mélange of Chanelissime, surrealism, and a touch of the sportif.</p><p>Starting things off was a silvery gray crochet-ribbon skirtsuit, accessorized with a major silver-link necklace. The chain motif reappeared as trim on boxy little Coco-esque jackets, some of which were wackily shown inside out with the familiar Moschino label decorating the nape of the neck. The surrealism came through in giant metal snaps on a red short-sleeve trapeze coat, and in clear plastic rain jackets punched out in eyelet patterns—definitely not waterproof. As for the sporty side of things, there were evening anoraks in taffeta and a healthy handful of rompers and onesies.</p><p>What to make of it all? It's not entirely clear Rosella Jardini and team were thinking clearly themselves. But that doesn't mean the show didn't offer a few moments of meaningless fun.</p></div>"
141,spring,2008,s2008,naeem-khan,"""I have to stick with what I know best,"" Khan told Style.com. ""I love this collection. It's happy and beautiful."" The designer, who spent three weeks in his native India this summer, has been pondering ways to take Indian luxury and merge it with American glamour. The answer? Ethnic decoration applied to Western silhouettes, of course—a solution that's served him well before. Khan's kind of fashion isn't about being a smarty-pants or pushing any big envelopes; it's about sparkling dresses for sparkling women.</p><p>Queen Noor of Jordan was watching. Paisley-embroidered caftans channeled Talitha Getty, the sixties pioneer of Moroccan heiress chic; short shantung dresses conveyed Jackie O. White-on-white embroidered shorts were very Palm Beach, palazzo pants very <em>La Dolce Vita</em>. If you still think diamonds are a girl's best friend, take a second look at Khan's clear-beaded nude chiffon Marilyn Monroe gown. And it would be difficult not to feel like a queen for a day in one of the entirely jewel- and bead-encrusted, yet airy, dresses that came toward the end of the show.</p><p>Allover beading in tribal patterns had fistfuls of glamour, which is what keeps the cadre of women who gave him a standing ovation coming back for more, more, more. But for all of their ooh-la-la dazzle, the encrusted collars and necklaces seemed rather passé.</p></div>"
142,spring,2008,s2008,naoki-takizawa,"Naoki Takizawa might be new to the New York schedule, but this Tokyo native isn't short of experience: He spent more than 26 years working with Issey Miyake, his mentor-turned-business partner (the fledging line is produced by Miyake's company).</p><p>Having established his studio last year, Takizawa decided to take his show on the road, debuting the collection here rather than Paris, Miyake's stomping ground, simply because he wanted a change. ""It's something new for me,"" he said backstage. It was something new for the audience too, when, before the lights went down, models suddenly appeared and sat in front-row seats or perched themselves on the runway. Takizawa wasn't about to do his show backward or anything as arch as that, though. Rather, he opened with tunics and pants, obi-belted jackets, and dresses with studlike detailing that mingled with a few awkwardly ruched leathers, some paired with midriff-baring tops.</p><p>A potential differentiating point for this line is its use of technology—a ""memory system technique"" that allows fabrics to keep their original appearance was one instance; foil printing in copper and sterling silver was another. If fact, the real standout pieces in a somewhat mixed bag were the pleated ones that evoked classical dress rather than anything high-tech (despite the fact they are made from ""densely woven microscopic filaments""). Smoking looks featuring pleated lapels gave way to a series of silk-nylon goddess dresses—some trailing angel-winglike streamers—that brought to mind Alber Elbaz's more proper take on pleating. But by applying a deconstructive ""pleat and release"" approach, Takizawa left his own mark on the Grecian formula.</p></div>"
143,spring,2008,s2008,narciso-rodriguez,"This was Narciso Rodriguez's first show since Liz Claiborne took a stake in his company this spring, and there was an air of anticipation on his runway that went beyond the video-camera melee caused by celebrity attendee Rachel Weisz. Would the cash infusion mean an increase in production values? Yes. Would it mean a change in direction? Not a chance. Rodriguez has an ultra-specific point of view; what's $12 million (the amount Claiborne paid for 50 percent of the label) in the face of his sacred devotion to precision seaming and architectural construction?</p><p>Working what he described as a ""ninja"" theme, he stayed true to his rigorous silhouettes but injected both a bit of Japonisme (kimono silks, floral embroidery) and a natty new masculinity—courtesy of copper oxfords made in collaboration with Sergio Rossi's Edmundo Castillo—into his familiar sexy mix. The show opened with a snug-waisted jacket with an abbreviated peplum and skinny, short pants. Following on were smart coats with hook-and-eye closures offset to one side, simple shirts with spliced necklines tucked into pants that laced up the back, and a great zip-front black dress with a purple stripe across the waist that could've been an obi. In fact, black, purple, white, and gray were the show's predominant colors, so a burnt-orange dress with a short, full skirt really stood out. It was a perfect balance of allure and ease, and made the slip dresses he showed look flimsy in comparison.</p><p>Evening is where that cash influx became obvious. While a nude dress and a black coat embroidered with whorls of georgette looked like quiet showstoppers, a pair of short cocktail numbers with caviar beads dusted across the front panels—the more striking of the two in lilac and black—are certified entrance-makers. The beginning of a beautiful relationship? From the looks of those two dresses, yes.</p></div>"
144,spring,2008,s2008,nathan-jenden,"London roots don't get much root-ier than Nathan Jenden's self-described ""son of a genuine Cockney."" So here he was, showing in an East End venue that's usually home to boxing matches, and he seemed to be suggesting in his show notes that the big bows that wrapped a lot of the outfits were a tip of the cap to Bow, as in the church (you can't be a Cockney unless you're born within the sound of Bow bells). But in those same notes, he also said something about ""Aztec priestesses and mad Mexican empresses."" And he called his show <em>She</em>, the title of a Victorian potboiler about an immortal sorceress. All of which whetted the appetite for some full-on fashion barbarism (foxy boxing, perhaps?).</p><p>So what a surprise it was that the designer appeared more engaged by pantalooned, petticoated girlies from a Feydeau farce than by any notion of primal womanhood. Layers of tulle petticoats frothed beneath full pleated overskirts; awning-striped shorts nestled below a blouse with huge leg-o'-mutton sleeves; and a poet's shirt billowed over full knickers, over which tiers of poufs also swelled. Lace, ruffles, bows, bubble skirts, huge white things—the overload was compounded by high-heeled mules, which, if the young mannequins' efforts were any indication, would function much better as lying-around shoes for <em>grandes horizontales</em> of La Belle Époque.</p><p>There was the (merest) suggestion of Maya in the burst of a bougainvillea petticoat, a fuchsia ruffle, and a strapless dress hand-painted with gold leaf (definitely one for your next human sacrifice). The prevailing sense, though, was that Jenden was playing away from his home at Diane von Furstenberg (who showed her support front-row center) by overindulging <em>his</em> own romantic fantasies for once.</p></div>"
145,spring,2008,s2008,nicole-miller,"The compulsion to clean house is strong in Spring—it's an opportunity to throw off heavy knits and turn the page on silhouettes that have fatigued the eye since February. For Nicole Miller, Spring 2008 is a moment for ""streamlined glamour"" and timelessness, not trends.</p><p>As she explained backstage, ""After all those big dresses, it's time to bring things in."" Sleek day frocks and high-waisted pencil skirts with pleated seams hugged curves that had been ignored of late. These were the kind of hardworking looks that loyal customers appreciate: classic enough for the office and sexy enough for afterward. Also fresh were wide-legged trousers cut in fluid tropical wool and paired with strong-shouldered blouses or boyish soldier's jackets.</p><p>The real news here, though, was Miller's sophisticated take on rompers (rechristened ""short jumpsuits,"" to avoid obnoxious playground connotations). And, of course, it wouldn¿t be Nicole Miller without a few prints. She eschewed her beloved paisleys for stained-glass patterns in jewel tones. Though eye-catching, these worked best in smaller doses, i.e., a blouse layered under a cardigan. Yes, there can be too much of a good thing.</p></div>"
146,spring,2008,s2008,nina-ricci,"""It was a group of girls you'd see on the street in the early morning coming from a ball,"" explained Olivier Theyskens. His wispy raggle-taggle troupe was wending its way home in a particularly poetic state of dishevelment, of course. Their clothes were ombré-tinted in subtle grays and browns, as if smudged by the murky first light of a city day. The opening girl had pulled on her boyfriend's dusty tux, which had come apart at the back, over an artfully wilted twisted satin tunic. Others had draped sloppy, holey cardigans over the shredded remains of charmeuse and chiffon, trailing stringy feather boas as they walked. Some, possibly, were even down to their shirts or slips (you know how you start losing things on a long night out?), and one had wrapped a blanket—or maybe the dance-hall curtain—over her chiffon gown.</p><p>One shouldn't read too much into the narrative, though, because Theyskens doesn't come from the older generation of theme-led designers. Instead, this collection was a reassertion of his Belgian identity. It's as if he reached a fork in his career when he arrived at Nina Ricci, deciding to take the path of underground edginess rather than Parisian chic—a distinct divergence from the road he took at Rochas. Now his vision skews young and urban, and includes jodhpur-ish jeans, patchworked tour T-shirts, hip baseball jackets, and a sense of working toward a new, layered assemblage of casual dressing. Up to a point, anyway. For evening, Theyskens was fully back within his familiar zone of strapless ball-gown romance. The paper-thin silver fan-pleated taffeta, twisted metallic velvet, and diaphanous chiffon poufed in back with a demi-crinoline were beautiful, if a tad familiar—but in terms of interest, what he's doing for day is the thing to watch.</p></div>"
147,spring,2008,s2008,noir,"The line was founded two years ago by Peter Ingwersen, a Dane whose mission is to ""create meaningfulness in the luxury segment."" You hear a lot of hoo-ha these days about how this or that designer is going to save the world one anorak at a time, but this one is putting his money where his mouth is. Igwersen not only purchases goods that support sustainable businesses in developing nations (about 70 percent of the line was made from certifiable materials), but he's also developing a collection of organic cottons in Uganda. (The new fabric brand, called Illuminati II, is set to launch next year.)</p><p>But, though virtuous, there is nothing crunchy or goody-two-shoes about Noir. We're not talking T-shirts here. In the past, in fact, Ingwersen—who wove in his new line of see-through lingerie on this week's runway—has skewed things a bit too far in the fetish direction. However, his Manhattan debut was reigned in, pared down, and precision-tailored.</p><p>Ingwersen did what could best be described as Danish modern. Looking for a snappy white suit, dangerous micro mini, or a great shrunken bomber? He's your man. While the sleevelike leggings might be a fright on anyone but a lithe-limbed model and the big evening numbers sort of fizzled, several other after-dark looks (a shocking-pink party dress, a sensuous silken shirtdress, an elegant sequined cardigan) were elegantly effective.</p></div>"
148,spring,2008,s2008,ohne-titel,"""There's a sense of intuition that goes into designing clothing; you know for yourself what you want,"" said Alexa Adams, who, with Flora Gill, designs the self-confident new line Ohne Titel. That's German for ""untitled,"" but judging from this polished runway debut, it's a name to be reckoned with. The duo—Parsons graduates who collaborated on their senior thesis and later worked together for Karl Lagerfeld—brought their own point of view to the safari theme that has been running wild since Resort. Their printed, body-conscious knits were developed after looking at tribal art, totem poles, and the graphic work of the French painter Jean Dubuffet; the accessories were raffia and rubber numbers of their own invention. Softer, but in a sculptural way, was a series of bustle-back skirts. The cream of this collection, though, was the suiting. A red draped jacket paired with wide-leg pants had an irresistible fluidity. ""It's sort of cheesy, but we're into the eighties idea of clothing for working women,"" said Adams, who looks to have quite a promising career ahead of her.</p></div>"
149,spring,2008,s2008,oscar-de-la-renta,"Ralph Lauren isn't the only designer in town who can put on a show with a capital ""S."" Oscar de la Renta left the Bryant Park tents for the tonier environs of a decommissioned Georgian church at 583 Park Avenue this season, and hired the blissed-out choir-cum-high-school-jazz-orchestra the Polyphonic Spree to perform its feel-good hits. What's more, he had Roger Federer in his front row, fresh off the tennis ace's fourth U.S. Open win.</p><p>The collection itself more than lived up to any heightened expectations the change of scenery might have produced. De la Renta touched upon several of Spring's developing trends—the safari jacket, tribal patterns and beading, strong color—without feeling trendy in the least. Classic is more like it, be it the perfect red wool sheath, a stunningly embroidered black-and-burgundy suit with a cropped jacket and razor-slim skirt, or a tent dress in a brown-and-cream ethnic geometric print. Only a couple of cable sweaters, worn with full pants, came off on the wrong side of the maturity/youth divide. But the designer quickly corrected that with a cardigan in of-the-moment tie-dye.</p><p>Evening was a study in elegance, whether de la Renta went understated, as he did with a sublime black silk sponge crepe gown cinched above the waist with a lizard belt, or bold. If you want drama, the show's closing number—strapless, with a spray of glossy black feathers decorating the neckline—is your dress.</p></div>"
150,spring,2008,s2008,paul-smith,"After decades of practice, Sir Paul Smith gives good sound bite. ""Hockney meets Bloomsbury"" was his succinct summation of his women's collection for Spring. If that evokes a mélange of primary colors and florals with a twist of haute bourgeois eccentricity, then you clearly understand Sir Paul's shorthand. The color was strongest when applied to classic shapes, as evidenced by a cornflower-blue shirtwaist dress, a green parka, and a tomato-red blouse (the matching bow tie a prissy flourish). The elongated proportions of a knee-length cable knit with a dropped half-belt suggested Bloomsbury's bohemian languor, just as a silky floor-sweeping skirt or the floral print on a kimono-ish top hinted at the gardens of Charleston, where Vanessa Bell entertained her sister Virginia Woolf and their coterie.</p><p>The outfits had the artfully thrown-together quality you might find among the guests at a country house party: Formal and casual elements combined in such looks as a black velvet jacket over white cotton Bermudas, a little gray cardigan pulled over a red shirtwaist, or a blue cummerbund wrapping the waist of tiny shorts under a cardigan jacket. The same notion was elaborated on in a full white tie rig trimmed down to a shawl-collared tap suit, as well as in a rugby shirt stretched to the floor and given dress collar and cuffs. If there was a slightly random quality to the whole affair, you could argue that's always been Smith's charm.</p></div>"
151,spring,2008,s2008,peter-jensen,"Oh, what a silly yet endearing personality is Peter Jensen. His gently hilarious shows are acquired taste in London, but once you get into it, his obsession with the stranger aspects of American suburban culture makes for an entertaining serial. In the latest installment, after interludes with the work of Sissy Spacek and Tina Barney, he's turned—perhaps inevitably—to John Waters, and made his collection an ode to the filmmaker's wicked star, Mink Stole.</p><p>The program notes set the scene: ""Dottie Hinkle is a Baltimore housewife. She keeps a perfect home but the crank calls of her psychotic neighbour are driving her to the edge of reason…"" Her looks involved Hawaiian print shirts, two-tone denim skirtsuits, a ""splash-proof"" housecoat, and parma violet patent loafers. And then there was Taffy—""Poor Taffy, the neglected daughter of übercriminal and beauty icon, Dawn Davenport, has never been allowed to grow up…"" Thus, she's outfitted in a cream high-waisted dress and a babyish ruffled bed jacket.</p><p>Of course, you have to laugh out loud. There's a twist, however, and that is in the sheer normality of Jensen's clothes. Though imbued with his subtle sense of humor, his collection is really about clean, pleasantly wearable pieces, like gingham bombers, off-pastel knits, and collegiate shirtwaisters. In a store, no one would ever guess they were spawned by such a camp concept.</p></div>"
152,spring,2008,s2008,peter-som,"It has been an exciting few weeks for this 36-year-old designer. Hot on the heels of his appointment as creative director of Bill Blass came the announcement last week that a big retail developer, NRDC Equity Partners, had bought a majority stake in his company. Change was also in the air at his Spring show, which showed him moving, promisingly, in a more streamlined, less obviously pretty direction.</p><p>Som was trained as an architect, and his creative wheels were set spinning during a recent trip to Spain, where he visited the Hotel Marqués de Riscal, Frank Gehry's swirling titanium expansion of an ancient sandstone winery in Rioja. Marqués de Riscal was an apt metaphor for today's outing, which sought to put a twist on the traditional.</p><p>Som renovated classic American sportswear pieces, updating them with his toolbox of light fabrics (tweed prints, seersuckers, silk-screened dévoré Chantilly lace) and some cleverly mixed and matched textures. ""Curvilinear"" was one of his catchwords, and while trousers and skirts were cut full and fluid, other pieces hugged the body, like a metallic sequined sheath. ""The clothes are cleaner than last season,"" Som told Style.com. ""And there's not a single bow. I'm shocked, myself!""</p></div>"
153,spring,2008,s2008,phi,"From Mick Rock to Mick Jones.… Last season, Phi designer Andreas Melbostad nodded to the former's iconic photographs of glam rockers like David Bowie. Today's collection, meanwhile, owed its origins to what the designer called the ""insouciant yet elegant"" look of Jones and the rest of the Clash.</p><p>Melbostad made use of his considerable tailoring skills via jackets and coats in banker gray or black suiting. But punk rockers don't frequent Savile Row, do they? So he shrugged off conservatism with exaggerated proportions and layered the collection up with endless vests, skinny mesh knits, jersey tanks, striped men's shirts, and lean pants tucked into studded biker boots. As the show progressed, the rebellion grew louder—mostly in the form of zippers and other assorted hardware on bombers, cargo shorts, and skirts.</p><p>Backstage, Melbostad said that his aim was to be ""urban and contemporary, rebellious yet sophisticated."" But there were a few problems in the execution. It was too heavy for Spring, to begin with. And while any decent record-store clerk (there are some left, right?) can explain why glam rock and punk are diametrically opposed, this show didn't offer much sense of progression from Melbostad's layered and dark Fall collection. Reinventing the wheel every six months isn't necessary, but moving forward is.</p></div>"
154,spring,2008,s2008,philosophy,"It's <em>amore</em>: Alberta Ferretti ♥ the Big Apple. At her second presentation here, Ferretti announced that her number-two line would be making New York its permanent home. ""It's the perfect place for Philosophy,"" Ferretti said. ""New York has such a sense of life in the streets that is very today and now. It's unlike any other city.""</p><p>The Italian designer greeted a sizeable international crowd—including Tatiana Santo Domingo, Padma Lakshmi, and Coco Brandolini—at the Hosfelt Gallery in the Garment District. Philosophy is skewed toward a younger customer, and its oeuvre slants toward off-kilter embellishment and highly feminine dresses. This collection was especially girlish, though not sugary-sweet. Against a glaring backdrop of bare bulbs and fluorescent lights, Ferretti showed a buoyant lineup of wearable, jaunty dresses and saucy minis. Many came collaged with a mix of striped cottons, natural linens, and prints borrowed from either seventeenth-century frescoes or Louise Bourgeois drawings. The abundance of stripes added a fresh, seaside feel, but the collection didn't bash you over the head with a nautical theme. Evening was similarly effortless, with crinkled silks slathered with silver-dollar paillettes. All in all, Ferretti is going the right way about wooing her new favorite city.</p></div>"
155,spring,2008,s2008,pollini,"Milan's punishing schedule of Spring shows has turned the week into a big squeeze for everyone—designers, retailers, press, models, et cetera, et cetera—and someone has to lose. It's a shame that scheduling conflicts meant more people didn't see Rifat Ozbek's latest collection for Pollini, because his tribal-techno theme attached itself effectively to the London vibe that has seeped onto fashion's international stage. There was a blissed-out moment in the late eighties when Ozbek offered an all-white collection that captured the second Summer of Love's youthquaking optimism and energy, and he harked back to it here with a sheer-sleeved white shift. There were also new-rave echoes in the accessories (especially the fluoro shoes) and in John Gosling's sensational soundtrack. But, equally, Ozbek has always been a dab hand at integrating ethnic elements into his designs. A bold ikat was a running motif in this collection—in a shift over sheer pants, in chiffon layers as a ghostly pattern, or as a trim on tops and trousers. Africa made its presence felt in leopard-print shorts or the tribal beading on a khaki coat-dress. Ozbek has a real knack for giving interest to simple shapes with such flourishes. Along the same lines, he used a mélange of antique coins as a neckpiece from which to hang one of the shaped tunic tops that were a key silhouette for the collection. Pair that with his cigarette-slim pants in batiked organza, and you've got a look that effortlessly spans elegance and excess.</p></div>"
156,spring,2008,s2008,prada,"Fairies? At Prada? Why, yes: When Miuccia is fed up with being perverse in the anarchic-fierce way, she'll change tack yet again and go against the grain by being so sweetly unchallenging you (almost) can't recognize her. So Prada for Spring went late sixties, early seventies, Art Nouveau-ish—tripping off into the kind of tendrilly doodles girls used to scrawl on their bedroom walls after studying their hippie-romantic rock album covers. At any rate, that was what seemed to be evolving as a collection of silk-printed tunics, paired with cropped flared trousers and cutaway spat-boots, began to wend its way out. They were followed by skinny-rib knits, some in the form of all-in-ones, and then it was away with the fairy story: wood-nymph illustrations printed on greenish-tinted chiffon, growing over skirt petals and entwining themselves around the bodices of dresses.</p><p>It was, said Prada, ""about trying to find a new creativity."" It was certainly a softening up from the last two seasons and technically accomplished in its curvilinear lines, traced with contrast piping to run around necklines and up to chokerlike collars. Clumpy-heeled suede platforms and cutaway boots grounded it all in some eye-catching footwear. If that sounds retro—maybe a little Ossie Clark or Biba—it was. But, as always with Prada, any literal connections between past and present were contradicted by other threads of thought. One was about big, puffy organdy skirts, and the other—which happened to yield the chicest blue-and-red patterned dress in the collection—was slim-knitted calf-length sheaths, a continuation of Prada's enduring love for sweater dressing. The latter proved that no matter how far she apparently diverges from the last season, this is a woman who never loses the plot.</p></div>"
157,spring,2008,s2008,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"With Luella Bartley and Matthew Williamson electing to stay home this season, it fell to Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi of Preen to fly the British flag in New York. A sudden swell of buzz accompanied their ten-year-old label's stateside debut (having Agyness Deyn, already this week's unofficial mascot, in your corner will do that). If today's show didn't blow away those expectations, it offered more than enough reason to extend the brand's visa.</p><p>Each Preen collection exists within the context of the one before. ""Where we left off with last is where we start,"" Thornton told Style.com. ""It's always a journey for me and Thea."" So last season's fixation on the eighties aggressions of Claude Montana or, if you prefer, Thierry Mugler (neon-pinks and new-wave zippers and pleats like the exoskeleton of an insect) softened into shiny satin wraps, parachute pants, and lace bodysuits—call it Versace territory.</p><p>Graphic body-con silhouettes alternated with slouchy sensual ones; silks mingled with suedes; and everything was worked up in a Saint-Tropez palette of sand, blue, olive, lilac, orange, and white. The active-sport touches—drawstrings and anoraks—looked especially good. What Thornton and Bregazzi do best is a mash-up of classics: silk blouses, trousers, and bathing suits, like the showstopper worn by Anja Rubik. Next stop, L.A.?</p></div>"
158,spring,2008,s2008,pringle-of-scotland,"It's clear where Clare Waight Keller fits into the general picture. She's a young British designer who, to judge from her easy, sporty-looking collection, is working the same kind of groove Phoebe Philo carved out at Chloé or, possibly, the enhanced street-y sorts of looks Christopher Bailey was doing before he made Burberry internationally glossy. That doesn't mean Waight Keller is derivative; she's just focused on putting together realistic pieces, like cropped suede bombers, short-sleeved taffeta parkas, chino skirts, long cotton shorts, and wide-legged slouchy pants. ""I just want it to be young and fresh and to have a real ease,"" she said. That came across in her billowy cotton print sundresses and in the fine-gauge knits—good for layering, and a strong selling point for a house that is based, of course, on its heritage of sweaters.</p></div>"
159,spring,2008,s2008,proenza-schouler,"Three days old now, this reshuffled fashion week has gotten off to a less-than-inspired start. But leave it to Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough to pump some blood into the proceedings. Their new silhouette is decidedly body-conscious: With cinched belts everywhere and just one pair of pants on the runway at tonight's venue, the Park Avenue Armory, Spring is all about the waist and the legs—the longer the better.</p><p>The show began with a short black dress topped off by both a hemp waistcoat and a second, more abbreviated vest. Following on were a number of looks with a vaguely military air, complete with cavalry hats by fashion's new favorite milliner, Albertus Swanepoel. From there, the clothes took on a more tribal feel. Black-and-white striped jackets were layered over shirtdresses and long-sleeved tees, and the bodice of one dress was beaded in a zebra pattern. Altogether, things were less posh and more street than last season, and, for that reason, the collection seemed truer to the duo's own personal style.</p><p>Hernandez and McCollough said they wanted to explore the idea of contrasts, ""something organic and man-made, primitive and refined."" And thanks to the fact that Valentino Fashion Group bought a 45 percent stake in the company in July, Proenza Schouler can afford to really up the ante on the refinement front. The gold-leaf silk pieces that closed the parade—Liya Kebede's double-breasted sleeveless coat-dress was the best—are as luxe as it gets, and will no doubt require a socialite's or celebrity's hefty wallet. Demi Moore swooped out after the show with, count them, four bodyguards in tow. The boys should ask to borrow a couple of those: There are going to be plenty of eager ladies elbowing to wear these clothes.</p></div>"
160,spring,2008,s2008,rachel-comey,"Rachel Comey, who attended Miss Porter's School in Connecticut before studying sculpture in Vermont, could be described as a homecoming queen of the arty downtown set (one of the Marsden girls modeled for her Fall lookbook). And the designer's Spring show, staged at St. Patrick's Youth Center on Mulberry Street with live accompaniment by the three-piece band Barbacoa, had something of a prom atmosphere. After looking to the Amish for inspiration last season, Comey said she wanted the current collection to be ""playful and a little bit naughty."" High-waisted flower-sprigged shorts worn with pretty blouses and modest jackets still had a pinch of <em>Big Love</em> plainness, but bustiers paired with slim, cropped pants and dresses with lingerie details added a hint of <em>Grease</em>-style sauciness. Seemingly demure dresses had racy T-backs. The show, which focused primarily on texture, was somewhat repetitive and overlong, though it also offered proof that Comey is graduating to new levels of maturity.</p></div>"
161,spring,2008,s2008,rachel-roy,"As a designer—and as a dresser—Rachel Roy likes a flourish: puff sleeves, ruffled necklines, embroideries. This season, with weekend trips with her daughters to the MoMA for inspiration, there wasn't a blank canvas in her collection. A boatneck A-line dress and boxy, zip-front coat came in a silk photo-printed with delicate pastel watercolors. The front of a narrow sheath was a patchworked collage of multicolored netting. And one softly shirred, sexy chiffon number in shades of chartreuse, steely gray, and black evoked a Rothko painting.</p><p>""But it's about balance, too,"" said Roy, who is quietly proving that, despite her busy social calendar, she should no longer be considered a socialite designer. ""Who wants to be girly all the time?"" So there were also masculine elements, such as full-legged upholstery plaid pants or, more subtly, tough chain-link belts accentuating the waist of a fitted dress and the neckline of a plunge-front tank. In the end, though, Roy can't resist a feminine detail. That boyish black-on-creamy-white plaid? It also appeared as a knee-length dress dolled up in sequins. But then, with fashion moving in a more polished, pulled-together direction, her natural instincts look to be spot on.</p></div>"
162,spring,2008,s2008,rag-bone,"When they launched their womenswear collection two years ago, David Neville and Marcus Wainwright set out to re-create American classics, but with a luxe, urban sensibility. Since then, they've proven themselves as accomplished tailors with a hip factor that lands starlets like Kate Bosworth and Amanda Peet in their front row. (It doesn't hurt, of course, to have one of the world's top makeup artists, Gucci Westman, for a wife and collaborator, as Neville does.) For Spring, he and Wainwright polished things up a notch without veering too far from their roots, showing an update on the safari jacket paired with tapering pants, a mod-look black shirt worn with high-waisted white tuxedo trousers, and a skinny, boy-for-girl waistcoat that topped a pair of sharp, cropped slacks.</p><p>Their starting point—""late-sixties and early-seventies James Bond,"" Wainwright said backstage—added a dose of sex appeal to the collection, most obviously in the form of an Ursula Andress-worthy bikini and an equally revealing leotard. If the designers misstepped, it was with dresses. Familiar shapes like a floaty trapeze frock and a baby-doll smock lacked the subtle subversiveness of the duo's more androgynous looks. Still, there were plenty of pieces for the girl who likes her basics with a toughened-up edge.</p></div>"
163,spring,2008,s2008,ralph-lauren,"It was a fashion spectacle to end all spectacles. To celebrate his 40th anniversary in business, Ralph Lauren staged an extraordinarily lavish runway show and black-tie after-party in the Central Park Conservatory Saturday night. And it wasn't only celebrities or moguls—everyone from Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman to Sarah Jessica Parker and Diane Sawyer to Mayor Michael Bloomberg—who came out to support him. His designer peers—Vera and Carolina and Diane and Donna—did, too. Afterward, Karan joked, ""I'll tell you what I'm not going to do: After <em>that</em>, I'm not going to have a show!""</p><p>As for the clothes, Lauren said, ""I drew upon everything I ever loved, and that was it."" He touched upon many of his best-known signatures, including haberdashery, equestrian themes, and Anglophilia, but this wasn't a greatest-hits collection—there's a Rizzoli book coming out next month that will cover all that. The show started in black and white: a ruffle-hemmed gown cut higher in the front to flash sexy fishnets and worn with a picture hat straight out of <em>My Fair Lady</em>, followed by a man's re-proportioned houndstooth jacket, waistcoat, and full-leg pants. From there, the designer worked his way through exuberantly colorful floral-print silk-georgette evening dresses and equally vibrant jockey wear. Before finishing with a red-carpet stunner in swagged silver chain and tulle, he sent out a group of taffeta dresses in bold primaries that stood out for their simplicity.</p><p>When all 72 looks had come and gone, a tuxedoed Lauren took an emotional stroll down the runway, greeting well-wishers and drawing wife Ricky to his side. The scene was accompanied by a standing ovation and Frank Sinatra's <em>The Best Is Yet to Come</em>. And to prove it, the painted backdrop parted to reveal a candlelit garden with tables for 400 guests. Hollywood couldn't have executed a grander, more cinematic moment.</p></div>"
164,spring,2008,s2008,ralph-rucci,"There has been a lot of emphasis on craft this season, and so Ralph Rucci was entirely in his element at his first-ever ready-to-wear presentation in Paris. Jaws dropped at a braided leather jacket worn with hammered-satin pajama pants, a taffeta dress with a fitted bodice nipped and tucked from butter-soft alligator, and a gown covered in silver tinsel that swished like air rustling through trees as the model made her circuit of the Palais de Tokyo.</p><p>Sometimes, though, you can't help wishing Rucci would let his ideas fly, rather than hitching every one of them, however jaw-droppingly, to a demonstration of technique. While his fans among the ladies who lunch are legion, he hasn't yet quite managed to win over a broader audience, and it might help if he could loosen up just a little bit. A groovy young chick could certainly connect with a blue-black taffeta dress with a big bow at the waist or a chocolate feather-and-lace cocktail number from the second half of his show (made up of his couture pieces). It would be interesting to see Rucci extend his talents further in this direction.</p></div>"
165,spring,2008,s2008,reyes,"Not all of the tennis action this weekend is happening in Queens: José Ramón Réyes, for one, served up a collection that was inspired by the sport in its twenties incarnation. ""Every season there's a different theme, but I always keep sportswear in mind,"" he said. Easy drop-waist dresses (which featured charming dressmaker details like embroidered Mokuba ribbon, elastic puckers at the hip, and caviar beading for evening) held court with fuller ""surfer"" trousers, khakis, blazers, and tweed shorts. These were worn with Deauville-striped knitwear, a new category for the designer. Réyes might not have taken many chances with this rather one-track show, but he had his winners.</p></div>"

Since Fall, he's added to his roster two pre-collections: a recently completed pre-spring and a breakthrough Resort that scored him a first-time order from Bergdorf Goodman. Well, those long days in the studio have paid off. This Spring was the designer's most accomplished collection yet. Before the show, Chai laid out his agenda: giving city women a new, sophisticated way to dress. ""It's not trend-driven,"" he explained. ""It's more about timelessness and pure design."" Chai worked in long, attenuated silhouettes in dusty, cool colors with a clear Belgian influence. It's a look that has just enough fashion for the mean streets without being liable to draw stares on the subway.</p><p>Lean but fluid floor-length skirts and dresses came with sporty pairings—a soft leather bomber, a long cotton-silk anorak. Those may be familiar staples, but Chai has a knack for adding subtle refinements, like the gentle pleats on a neckline or the elegantly slender racerback on everything from skinny knits to a daywear shift dress. Though suit jackets, also with lengthened proportions, were abundant, it was the array of white shirts in shadow-striped cotton (and one in a terrific bleached print) that stood out among the more tailored looks.</p><p>Chai carried his menswear notions into evening with a silk crepe waistcoat and pants followed by a trompe l'oeil waistcoat gown. But the more he gets to know his customer, the more he realizes she's a sucker for his dresses, too. He offered her a lot to love in crepe shirtdresses and charmeuse shifts. This designer is growing up quite nicely.</p></div>"
167,spring,2008,s2008,richard-nicoll,"Whether it's the injection of cash that did it, or turning 30, a transformation has come over Richard Nicoll's collection in the space of six short months. Within three looks—layered white organza shirting, a tailored jacket with a stiff geometric peplum, and a narrow mid-length silver sequin skirt—this talented young Australian had his audience sitting up, looking surprised. Here was a complete image, part Amish, part early-eighties Japanese—but also believably real-life-now.</p><p>Nicoll has already established the fact that he can design excellent shirts—his contributions to last year's shirtdressing trend were some of the best. But we've also seen him play around with American sportswear and trot out a pair of big pleat-front trousers, which scared most women to death. In most people's minds, he was a ""junior"" designer. Then he won the French ANDAM award and the British Fashion Forward. Now, look: The linebacker football shirts have morphed into grown-up tailoring with a built-up shoulder line (as in a gilded sleeveless coat-dress), and those once-heinous pants have been relaxed to drape and flow in a way that looks totally believable.</p><p>With fan-pleated, tiered accordion skirts in white, ivory, and nude organza and many graphic variations on his signature shirts, he also caught the feeling for plays of transparency and opacity Marc Jacobs probed in New York. Midway, there was even a glimpse of color as tiny, diffuse splashes of violet and pink appeared on a pair of skinny white jeans and a silk shirt. If Nicoll can keep up this pace, he'll find himself moving up to the next league.</p></div>"
168,spring,2008,s2008,rick-owens,"""I indulged myself so much in furry cavemen last season, I thought it'd be fun to go crisp,"" said Rick Owens backstage. Dropping Fall's much-praised shaggy shearlings and flowy skirts, he worked instead in sharp, clean skins—eel, snake, or ostrich—and sculptural gazar. Usually Owens likes to cocoon the body in trailing bits of jersey or washed leather, but here he focused on manipulating, almost distorting, the female silhouette—""the grand gesture,"" he called it.</p><p>Dresses came with high, funneling necks and bodies that twisted around the torso to create pouchlike pockets, a soft fold at the upper back revealing a flash of female skin. The best came in solid black or white; less successful were the ones in graphic stripes that zigzagged back and forth and around the dresses—there was nowhere for the eye to settle, and all those beautiful drapes went unappreciated. Geometric, almost kimono-esque jackets and podlike vests, worn over tunics and dhoti pants, looked easier to carry off, though it wouldn't have hurt to see a proper pair of trousers (i.e., ones that didn't droop southward toward the knees). This wasn't Owens' strongest effort—it was more of a lark, if we read him right backstage—but then again, no one should begrudge him the right to go out on a limb.</p></div>"
169,spring,2008,s2008,roberto-cavalli,"The sex-bomb image has softened these last few seasons at Cavalli. But for Spring the designer went one better, seducing a still-skeptical audience with one of the prettiest collections of the week. A photo blowup of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles was the backdrop, but aside from the models' teased and upswept hair and silk dresses stenciled with a golden crown, the ""Let them eat cake"" moments were few and far between. His touch points could've been Karl Lagerfeld-era Chloé, Victoriana through a seventies lens, the soft-focus photography of Sarah Moon, and <em>Pretty Baby</em>.</p><p>The show opened with a trio of dresses in white lace batiste, the first two falling to the floor, the third a short trapeze paired with fringed leather pants. Fringe has been a recurring motif in Milan, but Cavalli's is thick, almost petal-like, and in shades of caramel and mauvish gray it made for some must-have coats. Following on, there were sheer Liberty-print dresses with drop waists and trailing scarves, some worn over full trousers. The most un-Cavalli look of all? A little blazer in a flower-bud print that topped a button-down blouse and flaring jeans.</p><p>Sure, there was one navel-revealing plunge-front gown, but for the most part Cavalli resisted the urge to go flashy for evening. Silk gowns with large see-through flower prints near the hems were very Lady of the Canyon. A short strapless dress in concentric layers of ombré chiffon—it looked like a garden rose blooming—was another highlight. From the excited talk about personal orders among editors over the course of the day, it's safe to say Cavalli won himself a few new fans.</p></div>"
170,spring,2008,s2008,rodarte,"The creative spark for Kate and Laura Mulleavy's fifth collection wasn't the soaring sculpture of Constantin Brancusi, or the pastoral portraiture of Thomas Gainsborough, or any of the other lofty conceits they've conjured in the past. It was a work trip to Japan they took in connection with their recent collaboration with the Gap.</p><p>Admired for the exquisitely untouchable level of their workmanship—while also being criticized at times for its being so refined as to be unwearable—the sisters are, if not quite coming down to earth, at least expanding their reach. They crafted their own kind of Japonisme, incorporating manga and the films of Yasujiro Ozu. There were <em>kawaii</em> (cute) elements, too, like the almost comically fierce studded shoes and the colored hair extensions. They sent out a lot more separates than they had before (cobwebby sweaters, paired with lean pants, and sack jackets were standouts). And, for the first time, they actually did sexy, with lingerie looks and peekaboo.</p><p>The show came to a dramatic end when two young men in suits appeared on the runway and opened a freight elevator to reveal a trio of models in goddess gowns. These were as lovely as any Rodarte has shown, but they weren't news. What was, was the sisters¿ intriguing effort to expand their oeuvre.</p></div>"
171,spring,2008,s2008,rodnik,"Richard Ascott and Philip Colbert are fantastic at popping up places—they're the highly spottable guys who've been seen around New York and at couture shows carrying matching parasols for the past couple of years. So internationally ubiquitous have they been that, until this week, few realized they're actually London-based. They are, though, and this season they presented themselves to the British Fashion Council and said they were ready to put on their first show, in the very cool ex-butchery refrigeration warehouse they have overlooking Smithfield Market. They got their slot to show a collection they say is ""aimed at the same sort of market as Phillip Lim,"" one that's accessible and mid-priced. Which is both sensible and ambitious—though, to judge from where they are now, it's going to be quite a stretch to achieve.</p><p>They said they'd been inspired by <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, but it hardly showed in the clothes, which were mostly minidresses in mod-ish sixties checks, shirtdresses, and a couple of print shirts. The best thing in the collection was a gold lamé wide-lapelled coat-dress. In all, though they've cultivated an image of charming amateurism, they need to put their fingers on a distinct design identity before they invite people over again.</p></div>"
172,spring,2008,s2008,roksanda,"Roksanda Ilincic is a strikingly tall, slender Serbian with a propensity, as a designer, for exaggerating things. In the past, if she'd done a pompom or a taffeta bow, it turned ginormous, and her flounces and explosions of tulle could go on into the next week. ""I can't help myself once I start playing,"" she said. ""And this time, I've tried to make the dresses look a bit like fashion sketches from the thirties to the seventies from a book I got for my birthday."" Thus, when her lovely long slivers of YSL-ish charmeuse occasionally encountered a jacket, the outcome was a supersize inflation in the shoulder department. There were two kimono-type affairs and a ""smoking"" bolero that was twice as wide as it was long.</p><p>As jokey as this sounds, the collection was imbued with Ilincic's innate elegance; the models somehow even managed to look like the designer at a party. This season, there was less of the raw edge and more sophistication, as in a long-sleeved ivory wrap with the shoulder line picked out in black and tied with a crystal belt, or the strapless gray-and-oyster column with a single puff for a sleeve. Ilincic's flourishes of 3-D decoration are always the delight, though. For Spring, they were made of balls of shredded organza, sewn to a bra strap or on the front of an evening vest—an effect that looked like an artist's pencil scribble of fur. Which is, of course, where the whole thing started.</p></div>"
173,spring,2008,s2008,rue-du-mail,"Martine Sitbon's Rue du Mail is on the fast track. Just one season after launching her new label, she opened her first store in Paris this week. And with her second collection, Sitbon put significant distance between herself and her former identity as a designer of moody, romantic things. For Spring, she seemed to be interested in inserting herself somewhere along the techno/hip/sporty continuum, a place where Marni's Consuelo Castiglioni has been known to play.</p><p>What that entailed was parkas over slipdresses, an accumulation of waistless and weightless shifts, and a closing series of high-shine graphic-print dresses that looked like ponchos with their sides spliced and their seams resewn at sharp angles. Sitbon has always had an eye for color, and the hues came on strong today: orchid, turquoise, orange, chartreuse, peach. And she hasn't abandoned her former inclinations altogether. Some of her dresses were embellished with swirling insets of micropleats at the bodice; others were decorated with matte white sequins around the neckline. But this did feel like a departure from her Fall debut, which leaned more artsy. It will be interesting to see which approach sticks.</p></div>"
174,spring,2008,s2008,ruffian,"Brian Wolk and Claude Morais have a rarefied vision. They make confectionary-sweet clothes for the good life and seem not to care too much about their hip quotient. With the fashion pendulum swinging back toward the pulled-together, there were many pieces in their Spring collection that looked right. Take, for instance, a one-shoulder cocktail number in hot pink satin-faced organza with a frill running down one side. But there were others, like a ruff-neck coat in that same shocking hue, that will never see the south side of 14th Street.</p><p>The designers said they were working with twin inspirations: Madame de Pompadour and seventies punk. The former, unsurprisingly, was the more obvious, bursting forth in wallpaper florals and outsize, at times over-the-top, ruffles. You had to look more closely for the hard edges, but they were there—in the form of a jeweled gold belt punctuating an organdy blouse and silk skirt, or a row of buttons that created an interesting rippled effect on the sleeves of a short, nipped-waist, white cotton dress.</p><p>Those sound like minor details, but for Wolk and Morais they could be the beginnings of an intriguing new direction—one that might help them cultivate a fan base in the downtown scene.</p></div>"
175,spring,2008,s2008,saint-laurent,"""I just started with three thoughts: blazers, sweatshirts, and a vaguely preppy idea,"" said Stefano Pilati, ""and then it went into thinking about goddesses, stars."" For many women in the audience, though, there was only one thought: at last, a jacket. In a season when so much of fashion has fallen for flowers, ruffles, and neo-hippie fantasy, YSL offered none of it. Instead, Pilati continued to steer the house toward the ""post-minimalist elegance"" he started out on last Fall.</p><p>Pilati is right to intuit the need for a creative approach to tailoring (it's gone more or less missing since Helmut Lang left the stage), and correct to feel that Rive Gauche ought to break free from the slavish cycle of reference to Yves. Besides, it's a fact that few things are more difficult to craft than a jacket and a great pair of pants, so what held the interest here were the minutiae of the cap-sleeved tailored vests, hip-length blazers cut with new volumes, and the variously calibrated high-waisted, ankle-cropped trousers. Those, done in blues, grays, and chino beige, were the most striking part in the collection, but Pilati wasn't content to leave it at that. His obsession with reinventing cut also led him to look at asymmetry, so that skirts dipped and blouses and dresses came one-sleeved. The best of these came alive in motion. Subtle darting gave even the strictest combination of a white shirt and skirt a quietly erotic—not to mention chic—impact when seen from behind.</p><p>There was more in the way of vaguely Vionnet-influenced thirties satin (the goddess symbolism made overt), and the ""star"" motif manifested in chain-linked reflective plastic breastplates, which came over as a bit nonplussing. Still, credit to Pilati for having the courage to keep on in the direction he believes in. If—to the disappointment of some—this collection wasn't one of those that shakes up the fashion agenda on a grand scale, its subtlety may pay off in the longer run in terms of consistency, and clothes to buy. With each season, it's becoming clearer that Pilati's YSL is on the side of strength, modernity, and the grown-up woman.</p></div>"
176,spring,2008,s2008,sari-gueron,"It can be difficult to recall that Sari Gueron made her name three years ago by designing elegant cocktail dresses with a distinctly 10021 slant. Perhaps it's because in her last two Spring collections, the designer has let her bohemian side shine through—especially in her standout show of 12 months ago, with its ethereal cotton dresses (styled with Birkenstocks, no less). With her latest collection, however, Gueron struck a wonderfully coherent balance. Like many designers who have tired of overly girlish frocks, she was hungry for a bit of grown-up polish. ""I wanted everything to be a little chicer, a little sexier,"" she explained before her show.</p><p>Gueron accomplished both in her first three looks, a primary-hued series of dresses with elegant gathered necklines and gently nipped waists that were short enough to be sexy but, in a great silk-cotton, maintained a casual attitude. That push-and-pull was evident throughout the show. Daytime looks that spoke to Gueron's love of the ad hoc, utilitarian garb that artists sport in their studios—such as linen shifts with patch pockets or baggy, rolled pants topped with a bright smock—were all neatly refined, despite their slightly sloppy origins. As for evening, a belted black chiffon dress with a touch of beading had all the ease of a T-shirt, and made you wonder why anyone would bother with the corset numbers that followed.</p></div>"
177,spring,2008,s2008,sinha-stanic,"It's a watershed season for Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic. In what could have been a disaster for a young label, they've moved from a relationship with the giant Italian company Aeffe and become officially independent. Somehow being on their own to work through a product from sketchboard to runway has been good for their souls and more satisfying. ""It feels much more personal,"" says Stanic.</p><p>What they brainstormed on, mostly, was airy fabric that keeps its structure—a trend all over the London runways. Case in point: turquoise and orange gazar, draped into halter dresses or subtle body-encasing jackets and skirts. These were offset by rockabilly hair, plus one or two black leather jackets that proved Sinha-Stanic is back, jibing with the rising street style. If they're retracing their steps to regain their creative center of gravity as young designers, that's probably a good thing.</p></div>"
178,spring,2008,s2008,sonia-rykiel,"You can usually count on the finale of a Sonia Rykiel show to deliver the feel-good moment of Paris fashion week, and this season's took the cake. As things came to a crescendo to the sound of Mick Jagger singing <em>Paint It Black</em>, the girls sashayed out—sashayed being the only word for it—in the palest of diaphanous nightgowns and feather chubbies, with rhinestone butterflies in their softly curled hair and Peggy Guggenheim sunglasses slipping down their noses. Sasha Pivovarova was done up to look the very picture of Isadora Duncan—if the famous dancer and choreographer had taken acid. By the time Sonia and her daughter, Nathalie, came out for their bows, there was a cloud of feathers in the air above the runway and the audience had been whipped up into a giddy froth.</p><p>As for the clothes that preceded this, there were—as usual—plenty of Rykiel signatures to keep the faithful happy, starting with bold trompe l'oeil jumpsuits, cardigans, and sweater dresses and working through saffron and vanilla panne velvet suits and frocks, and fine knits wrapped and draped around the body like stretch jersey. A pop-art daisy-print chiffon used for wispy, vaguely seventies dresses was Rykiel's nod to Spring's floral trend. It was pretty, as was the orange and black point d'esprit, but not half as memorable as the model bacchanal that closed the show.</p></div>"
179,spring,2008,s2008,sophia-kokosalaki,"Scan Sophia Kokosalaki's show, and you will find—if you're keeping up out there—a collection punctuated with pieces that are spot-on for the Spring agenda. Working backward, first isolate her diaphanous, white tiered crinkle-pleated gown—an Aphrodite apparition that could propel an event-bound nymphet to a moment of quiet glory. Note, too, Kokosalaki's attention to pants. Flared may be the general way to go this season, yet few have come up with a trouser as optically flattering as the sharp, long-leggedy pair she put under her lean, skinny tank. Casting around for a jacket with an emphatic shoulder? Or a loose T-shirt dress? She had those figured out, too.</p><p>Still, Kokosalaki isn't a designer who grasps at trends for the sake of it. The rest of the collection was a consistent development of her body of work—a bit urban new wave, with an underlying thread that as always wound back to her Greek roots. Thus, somehow, the signature pleated twists in the sleeves of her jackets and the raised seams in her gazar skirts referenced classical statuary, while the slouchy satin knicker-shorts and the pompom-trimmed shoes carried faint echoes of traditional folk costume. Not that it was any overt homage to her homeland. Kokosalaki is a London city-dweller with an overriding mission to present a cool, alternative elegance that, for the most part, could be worn on the street. For her, this was a softer and more accomplished step in the right direction.</p></div>"
180,spring,2008,s2008,strk,"After Danish designer Camilla Stærk moved here from London last year, she found herself screening and rescreening some of her favorite Woody Allen films, in particular <em>Manhattan</em> and <em>Stardust Memories</em>. And from those classic celluloid New York stories, she extracted three distinct Spring muses: the sweetly virginal Mariel Hemingway; the tough, cerebral Meryl Streep; and the sexy but complex Charlotte Rampling. You could trace those sources through 21 looks, the emotional range of which went from the girlish innocence of a white shirtdress and Day-Glo shorts to the dark sophistication of an oversized tuxedo-jacket-cum-dress and a shiny black waxed-canvas trench. The real excitement of Stærk's show at Scandinavia House, though, wasn't in watching the character evolution but, rather, the designer's.</p><p>Stærk's subversively minimal vision comes more clearly into focus each season. It's a treat to recognize the designer's hallmarks: pale gray leather, unexpected vivid flashes of color, an elegantly attenuated racer back. Amid these there snaked a lighter, more casual thread, courtesy of colorful checked cottons—a reflection, perhaps, of the sportswear influence of her adopted home. Though Stærk admitted to a tough year (the result of setting up a small business in a new country), this collection proved the effort has been worth it.</p></div>"
181,spring,2008,s2008,stella-mccartney,"She's become known for a playful, happy kind of cool, and Stella McCartney's latest collection furthered her easygoing cause with a deft assimilation of the season's trends. She started out with a long, flowing seventies dress in a wildflower-scattered silk voile, loosely tied at the neck, then used the same colorful fabric for the jumpsuits her label is so identified with. Doing her bit for the current pajama-dressing moment, she showed boxy blue silk pj tops with tap pants peeking out from beneath, or extended the top's hem a few inches down the thigh for a reinterpretation of her favorite shirtdresses.</p><p>Many of the white cotton frocks, with their dippy backs and suggestive ruffles, could've been nightgowns in a former life—but McCartney balanced all the dishabille with the blazers that she cut her teeth on in Savile Row, this time in a safari khaki or in double-breasted snow-white, worn with fluid, full-to-the-cuffed-ankle trousers.</p><p>The designer has a well-known dedication to vegetarianism and the environment, and the show's backdrop, a lushly beautiful ""vertical vegetal wall"" by the botanist Patrick Blanc, will be donated to a low-income housing project in Boulogne, part of an effort to help teach ecology at street level. The carved wooden clogs she asked her models to wear won't make it on the street, however: One pair didn't even make it up and down the runway before falling apart. But that's not of much consequence when the clothes are as pretty and wearable as they were today.</p></div>"
182,spring,2008,s2008,stephen-burrows,"Forgoing the expense of a runway show, Burrows invited his guests to a Garment District showroom to see his Spring collection. Even if the setting was a little lackluster, the clothes weren't. Exuberant was more like it—from the electric-bright colors (turquoise, royal blue, fuchsia, orange) to the flirty silhouettes. A hot-pink shirtdress with smocking front and back and a hem that barely grazed the model's upper thighs opened the show; closing it was a body-hugging white number that would have said ""cha cha cha"" even without Anna Cleveland's hip gyrations. In between were a dozen-and-a-half party dresses. A couple of them were encumbered by thick fringes from waist to hem; a few others, with Colorform embroideries, were too playful (read: young). But there were many more, especially the drapey charmeuses in lively confetti prints, that a modern-day clubber—Burrows was a Studio 54 regular, remember—would be thrilled to wear for a night on the town.</p></div>"
183,spring,2008,s2008,sue-stemp,"Big names buzz around this British designer. Kate Moss is a fan, and the artist Ben Copperwheat and the graphic designer Deanne Cheuk have collaborated on prints. At her third New York outing came more evidence of Stemp's ability to draw bold-name supporters: The front row was chockablock with young social types (Arden Wohl, Lauren Davis, Olivia Palermo), models (Jacquetta Wheeler, Agyness Deyn), and the odd music-scene figure (Mick Rock).</p><p>Stemp produced the sort of feminine, English bohemian clothes she does well, this time with an eye to the jet-set, disco-era seventies. There were flowing caftans, bra dresses, and disco jogging pants cut from silks and chiffons in bright colors and trippy prints (including one called Voodoo Ray). A snug vest worn with nothing underneath and a pair of pleated, wide-leg pants could have come from Bianca Jagger's wardrobe. A simple trench was cleverly detailed with paillettes cut from the lenses of mirrored sunglasses. This was a strong showing, with plenty to love for the Notting Hill eccentric and her American hipster counterpart.</p></div>"
184,spring,2008,s2008,tao,"In a season of toga and tribal, Tao Kurihara offered her own expressive takes on the two.</p><p>The lights went down and out streamed five girls, all wearing elegantly sculptural braided headpieces, all in lacy, frilly white cotton tops and bottoms or dresses, wrapped and draped and tucked around their narrow frames. The swaddled silhouette thus established, Kurihara moved on into florals, a sweet butterfly print, and rucksack browns and indigos. Dresses with floppy ruffles down the front, big puffy sleeves, and billowy skirts came to a focal point at the back, which was often bare. Other times, a long-sleeved shrug that barely grazed the shoulder blades topped a button-down blouse tucked into exaggerated bloomers.</p><p>After Fall¿s more sportif, commercial outing, this was a welcome return to the personal, imaginative, and romantic roots Kurihara has set down these last four seasons under the Comme des Garçons umbrella. No wonder, then, that she called this very pretty collection My Holy Tribe.</p></div>"
185,spring,2008,s2008,temperley-london,"With a soundtrack of crashing waves and four enormous beach umbrellas floating Mary Poppins-style above a sandy-hued runway, you scarcely needed a set of program notes to tell you that Alice Temperley had the seaside on her mind. But this wasn't your typical bikini-and-tunic jaunt to St. Bart's or Southampton. The incurably romantic designer anchored herself on the Atlantic shores of France, in Biarritz and Deauville, circa 1925.</p><p>The first two looks established the show's wide range: an airy strapless gown of pristine white chiffon tiers, followed by a dark tailored wool waistcoat over baggy trousers. Temperley explored the moment in bloomer-inspired jumpsuits, both short and long, and turn-of-the-century looks, like a lace corset with paper-bagged trousers that could have been nicked from a mourning suit. Her signature knit dresses, striped and in graphic intarsias, came in nautical Coco Chanel colors.</p><p>There were a few, shall we say, rocky moments: the overdone experiments in volume, the strange accoutrements on some tailored looks. Still, the show-closing series of typically feminine party frocks will satisfy the coterie of admirers—Christy Turlington Burns, Molly Sims, and Padma Lakshmi—crowded into the front row. The girls may need to jam even closer together next season: Temperley's popularity is sure to grow with the debut of her line for Target next month.</p></div>"
186,spring,2008,s2008,thakoon,"The award-winning Thakoon Panichgul, who showed his first collection just three years ago, doesn't need lessons in polish. And his popularity has been proven: Amanda Peet, for one, kicked off fashion week in one of his rose-splashed dresses.</p><p>But there's still room to grow. ""More than any other collection, this one is about mood,"" Panichgul said. ""I've never worked in that manner. I'm searching for new ways to be inspired. I want to evolve and give myself opportunities to learn.""</p><p>His homework this season was, apparently, research into the art of functionality, and American Sportswear 101. The show opened with the classics—button-downs, shirtdresses, blazers—and graduated to more complicated convertible dresses.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""q86yvn""></div></div><p>As he did for Fall 2006, Panichgul played with perception. Instead of trompe l'oeil buttons, this time he showed sweaters with sleeve ties, which gave the illusion of a second sweater wrapped around the neck, and pixilated prints. It was a much more challenging collection than the one that preceded it—for both the designer and the viewer—and the fashion world is watching with interest as he climbs that learning curve.</p></div>"
187,spring,2008,s2008,threeasfour,"Threeasfour’s Gabi, Adi, and Ange now find themselves in a strange position: part of the establishment. The avant-garde downtown designers, who were once said to share a bed with their former fourth, Kai Kühne, are CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists for the first time. They’re still playing with the curved seams and ruffled tendrils that are their signatures, but they’ve polished their act in accordance with their new status. Transparent mesh concentric circles were boldly spliced around the armholes of one blazer. Other wrap jackets came with slashes at the shoulder to reveal flashes of skin. A lilac maillot with a sheer panel arching from one hip to the waist was easily the sexiest of the season so far.</p><p>Evening is where these designers’ sensibilities really come through. One gown in layers of raspberry, buff, and white organza fit together like a big puzzle. However, Threeasfour’s ambition got the better of them with the two dresses that closed the show. These came with swooping streamers of organza rosettes that would make navigating a revolving door or dance floor an insurance risk. But the best pieces—like a pair of slinky, asymmetrically draped aqua silk dresses—exuded a confidence that suggested this threesome is quite content with its new situation.</p></div>"
188,spring,2008,s2008,todd-lynn,"Like a guy who always wished he'd been in a band but missed out, Todd Lynn re-creates rock scenarios on his catwalk. He called his Spring show Use Your Illusion and named each item for the metal bands that were one light in his darkness while growing up in small-town Canada in the eighties. But the inspiration was radically sublimated. Groups such as Warrant and Roxx were tack incarnate in their teased-out hair and snakeskin platforms. Here, the hair was slicked back and the snakeskin footwear came courtesy of Christian Louboutin. And the overwhelming impression of the clothes themselves was the hyper-tailored formality that is Lynn's signature.</p><p>In his hands, the tailcoat in which a bare-chested metal frontman might once have pranced was de- and reconstructed: shown sleeveless with squared-off tails in black Lurex cotton over a white silk cummerbund/waistcoat, or hybridized with a biker jacket, again with squared-off tails, in herringbone. The fan base for Lynn's trousers will surely grow with the new cross-pleating effect he came up with, adding a hint of volume to his attenuated silhouette. The trenches he showed in glazed silk were also a new dimension for him, like a collision of Old Hollywood and goth. In the same way, Lynn's loosely crocheted knits were a cross between Art Deco and punk. The attraction of opposites might be his fashion manifesto: Backstage, he talked about ""making men sexy and women sexy in the same thing."" Front-row fans Marc Almond and Courtney Love would surely be an interesting duo of guinea pigs for this project.</p></div>"
189,spring,2008,s2008,tommy-hilfiger,"Welcome to Chapter Two in what Hilfiger has called a ""rebirth"": his return to the runway with a more polished take on traditional American sportswear. ""It's a continuous evolution,"" Hilfiger said backstage. ""Everything we put into motion last season is starting to bear fruit."" Customers are embracing the more sophisticated merch, he added, and a new store is to open later this month on the red-hot retail stretch of Bleecker Street.</p><p>No surprise, Spring was about classic, alliterative Tommy-isms: ""carefree confidence"" and ""effortless elegance."" This meant some very familiar staples, including the trench, the brass-buttoned blazer, the shirtdress—the mood was F. Scott Fitzgerald, with a pinch of Lauren Hutton tossed in. A double-breasted navy jacket in coarse gabardine was worn over a pair of striped silk pajamas (kicking off a bonanza of stripes, both candy-colored and nautical). Silk blouses went with sailor pants, wide trousers, or cuffed shorts. And then came a few dress variations: fine knit intarsia shifts, a trench-detailed sheath, a flirty pink-and-white halter. Laced spectator sandals and straw hats underlined the <em>Gatsby</em> feel. Looking newer was a sharp-shouldered striped blazer that brought some Keith Richards edge to a white jersey dress. A few more items like that are needed next time to keep this evolution moving forward.</p></div>"
190,spring,2008,s2008,topshop-unique,"""You know that thing at the end of summer?"" asked Nick Passmore. ""When you think, 'I'll give up working and be a hippie for the rest of my life?'"" The Topshop Unique collection she and her team designed had that summer-city-beach-in-Goa vibe believably sorted out—especially as the audience, first day of the shows, was in much the same frame of mind. With the input of the stylist Jane How, the collection had a breezy, slouchy air about it, starting with a strong section of tie-dyed silk patchwork shirtdresses and parkas, eventually mixed with deep-blue pinstripe jackets and pants—""like when you appear in the office but don't want to give up your summer things yet.""</p><p>Walking on some great wrapped natural-leather cutaway high heels (Topshop's own line, getting better by the day), the girls sped out some perfect looks for next year's festivals, like an oversize anorak with pockets so capacious that, worst comes to worst, it could probably double as a tent. Later on, there was a bit of fantasy in turquoise one-shouldered cheesecloth and drifty muslin gowns. ""We were thinking elegant, sexy, cocktails on the beach,"" said Passmore. A pity really, that winter has to intervene before we get there again.</p></div>"
191,spring,2008,s2008,tory-burch,"On the first day of the collections, Burch figured prominently in a <em>New York Times</em> piece exploring the underworld of knockoffs, in which she is a target. The reporter focused on a sequined tunic, but you can also see cut-rate versions of Burch's elasticized ballet flat topped with a golden disc all over town. Though she filed an infringement suit for the flats, she remarked with typical sangfroid days before the show, ""I don't really care. There are always women who will want the real thing."" Intellectual property laws aside, there's obviously some satisfaction in the ultimate flattery of a fake.</p><p>Burch has struck gold with a high-society formula that is surprisingly populist in its appeal, and she mined that vein diligently for Spring. ""It's what I want to wear,"" is how she explained the American-in-Saint-Tropez grouping at her presentation at Christie's. The same could probably be said for the other two clusters of looks, one inspired by Palm Beach and the other by a lesser-known 1967 Audrey Hepburn film, <em>Two for the Road</em>.</p><p>For days at Pampelonne Beach, there was jaunty nautical fare, including a terrific boatneck sailor chemise with sequined stripes, and a chain-print maillot, evidence of her new emphasis on swim. The Hepburn movie inspired A-line dresses crusted with chunks of crystal. And for sunny southern Florida, it was linens with a gold trellis print and an easy palm-print gown with beaded straps. The quickly expanding company is placing more emphasis on accessories, and one of its two (yes, two) new Las Vegas boutiques is to be devoted entirely to them. Which of the runway's big straw bags, colorfully bold necklaces, gold cuffs, Grecian sandals, or spectator pumps will be pounced on next by the 8th Street copycats?</p></div>"
192,spring,2008,s2008,tracy-reese,"Who doesn't long for the days when travel was chic, a time before stretch-velour tracksuits, endless security hassles, and the soggy penne with chicken option? Celebrating a decade in business, Tracy Reese took her audience back to a more civilized era today with a collection that set out on a figurative trip to northern Africa—Tangiers and Tunisia, specifically.</p><p>The journey began with a strong group of black-and-white, spectator-inspired travel clothes. There were slim pinstriped skirtsuits, fitted jackets over lean sailor pants, and smart dresses, graphically striped with grosgrain ribbon and tulle. Relaxed, sequined pajama jackets were elegant and easy.</p><p>There were some bumps along the way, though. When Reese switched eras, hitting the disco seventies, the spell was broken.</p></div>"
193,spring,2008,s2008,trovata,"Trovata's John Whitledge hasn't lost his taste for quirky presentations, even though they tend to overshadow his slight if charming collections. Tonight's happening in the former Tunnel space included a mini set by Perry Farrell—yes, he sang <em>Jane Says</em>—and a capoeira performance, in which male musicians and dancers practiced the rhythmic Brazilian martial art in striped cardigans and hoodies, or vests and plaid button-downs, worn with rolled-hem pants and flowy scarves. To make the spectacle go down smoothly, there were more free Sagatiba rum drinks than you could shake a <em>berimbau</em> at.</p><p>What's the connection? ""My girlfriend is from Brazil,"" said the designer. ""It's about the openness, the laid-back lifestyle, the easy living of that place."" Way laid-back. The eight female models, all of whom were dressed in white, came out without shoes, which worked with a breezily short beach cover-up, or maybe a retro knit tennis dress edged in navy, but made less sense with a sixties-style A-line coat with those big, whimsical buttons Trovata is known for.</p><p>In many ways, Whitledge has taken his split with his erstwhile partners in stride. Still only 27, he recently opened a store in his former Newport Beach headquarters, so there's little reason to quibble with his success or his business plan. Too bad that tonight it was the theatrics that wowed, not the clothes.</p></div>"
194,spring,2008,s2008,tse,"From the first look out, a striking painted cotton poncho, it was obvious that Tess Giberson would be continuing the exploration of exaggerated volumes she began in her Fall collection. But where Fall rolled out in soft cowls of dove gray and charcoal, Spring was one of Giberson's most colorful showings, with marigold and cyan worked in among the tawny beige, steel, and olive tones. Also new were safari looks (a sleeveless trench on Natasha Poly stood out) and ""military abstractions"" (think long tunic tops with epaulets). Knitted cellophane became ghost layers over and under tanks.</p><p>The title of the collection, Giberson's fourth for the cashmere house, was Imprint. And while it was more evolutionary than revolutionary, the designer is quietly—but determinedly—making her mark.</p></div>"
195,spring,2008,s2008,tuleh,"This wasn't the most directional show of the week. No zebra safaris or Halston homages here. But it was certainly classic Bryan Bradley. A colorful coat boasted alligator buttons custom-made in New York; a belted navy cardigan topped a neat white skirt; and, in signature fashion, vibrant color played off confident pattern. If any label on the New York schedule has a bespoke quality, this is it.</p><p>The day before the show, the designer had told Style.com that ""the new couture"" was on his mind: ""Not couture as sanctioned by the Chambre Syndicale, but clothes that look like couture but don't act like it.""</p><p>""<em>Alta Moda in vacanza a Nuova York</em>,"" the program notes read. And the opening look, a metallic houndstooth coat lined in fuchsia and worn with a matching bow-tied pink sheath, demonstrated exactly what he meant: very polished, very ladylike, but very wearable.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ww5g7m""></div></div><p>Bradley stayed in his comfort zone—and why not? That zone has been very successful of late. Tuleh has a new president, Marco Cattoretti, who is developing new collaborative relationships (Alexis Bittar provided the jewelry for Spring, and Via Spiga produced a capsule collection of shoes); Bradley is currently creating an exclusive collection for Lord &amp; Taylor, too. ""I love my job!"" he said.</p></div>"
196,spring,2008,s2008,undercover,"A squad of girls in print bikinis, angular closed-in visored sunglasses, and soft backpacks set off the Undercover show at a military clip. That was just the sort of strange sensation that Jun Takahashi's audience seeks, but in a flash, it was gone. After that, truth be told, the expectation of witnessing one of Takahashi's off-kilter creative subversions of fashion slowly drained from the room. Not that the show was bad, per se, but it was harder than usual to see what the designer was getting at. The girls that followed dragged out wheelie-bag luggage and toted handbags, wearing little dresses embellished with his familiar dark insignias: embroidered skulls and giant spiders implanted in necklines, and belts made of satin-stitched mouths, each showing a set of sharp, bared teeth.</p><p>As a brand-confirming exercise, it was sound, and for Undercover's devotees, there'll be plenty to buy—dresses and tops petaled like bird wings, tiny brocade prom dresses, and (if anyone's really going to go for this emerging trend du jour) a satin pajama suit. This time, though, Takahashi's brain-spearing oddness didn't quite hit the target in the way his fashion audience craves.</p></div>"
197,spring,2008,s2008,united-bamboo,"Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki's enigmatic show notes cited Herzog and de Meuron, but if architecture was the duo's starting point, it only really came across in glimpses: in the origami detailing on the waistband of a flaring skirt, say, or at the neckline of the smock dress that opened the show, or on the front and back of a cropped, button-front jacket that was strangely heavy for Spring. As for the rest, it looked like a standard cross section of United Bamboo's reinvented classics: the seersucker suit, the shirtwaist dress, a windbreaker not in nylon but in luxe patent leather.</p><p>""You get what you came for,"" said one editor on her way into United Bamboo's show, referring to the predictability that has caused some to lose interest in the line. And though there was some on-trend news here—high-waisted, rolled-hem shorts worn with a prim golden Lurex puff-sleeve blouse; a flaring skirt teamed with a contrast-collar button-down shirt—the collection did feel rather flat.</p></div>"
198,spring,2008,s2008,valentino,"Last-chance alert: If you've ever harbored any vague fantasy about owning a Valentino, act now, or kick yourself forever. The designer's final ready-to-wear show before handing over the keys to his house was always going to be a souvenir-hunter's prime opportunity, but far better than that, it turned out to be one of his most appealingly modern collections in quite a while. Crisply puncturing the potential for a predictable end-of-era wallow in sentiment, Valentino played it as an upbeat, fast-paced whirl of breezy, pretty, drop-dead gorgeousness that blew any lingering sense of ladylike stuffiness to the winds.</p><p>If there's a problem, it's only being spoiled for choice. What to pick from the head-spinning plethora of dresses on offer? It could be something from the brief, sugar-pink group that opened the show. A short, one-sleeved shift, perhaps. Or maybe it should be something with Val's signature ruche-and-drape going on? For anyone with a curve and a penchant for the eighteenth-century milkmaid vibe, it would have to be the dress in dusty <em>eau-de-nil</em> chiffon with the flirtatious décolleté and swirly skirt. How about a Val bow? You'd find them on a taffeta-spotted sleeve, or sexily implanted along the spine of a slim ivory gown. One of his georgette flower prints? That little sheath with a garland of 3-D petals in the hem and neckline. Still, at a time like this, why not go for broke? When it comes to the ultimate evening hour, it's down to the final two in the goddess category: the vibrant Valentino red, or the amazing black column with a flip of silver tied at the shoulder. Oh, sweet agony.</p></div>"
199,spring,2008,s2008,vena-cava,"Lisa Mayock and Sophie Buhai have been reading <em>Hollywood Babylon</em>. Inspired by Kenneth Anger's lurid history of scandal, California-style, as well as by the industrial designer Achille Castiglioni, they threw a ""fake Hollywood party,"" placing 30 models among larger-than-life cutout images of Marlene Dietrich, Rudolph Valentino, and—less obviously—Woody Allen.</p><p>Although Mayock and Buhai said they were attempting to view film noir and MGM-era glamour through a ""darker, twisted lens,"" a light—occasionally slightly silly—mood prevailed. Beer-can print, anyone?.</p><p>The collection had both thirties polish and seventies languor (with a touch of kitsch—that typewriter print was a bit gimmicky, wasn't it?). <em>Babylon</em>-glamorous were the screen-siren gowns, like a chartreuse number named Ziegfeld. But it was the unexpected menswear styling and the sportier looks—slim trousers, a cropped leather jacket—that really deserved top billing. Those rakish pieces suggested a brand known for lovely dresses in lovely prints has more range than previously suspected.</p></div>"
200,spring,2008,s2008,vera-wang,"For Spring inspiration, Vera Wang looked to ancient Rome—an apt metaphor, some might say, for modern-day New York. She's among the most intellectual of American designers, but what got her going was probably less the similarities between the two societies than the fluid ease of the earlier epoch's clothes—not to mention the gilt and bullion. Either way, this finely wrought collection deserves plenty of praise.</p><p>Reimagining the toga for today, Wang showed an elegant, asymmetrical navy silk day dress; a limpid jersey tunic worn with soft, washed crepe de chine pants; and graceful cashmere knits with flyaway chiffon panels at the sides or back. The full, shin-length skirts were the only things here that didn't look Roman, or right.</p><p>Wang has a vibrant sense of color. Metallic blue brushstrokes vibrated across an olive green duchesse satin wrap coat, and a peplum jacket and asymmetrical skirt in the same fabric were tie-dyed to resemble clouds. Evening looks ranged from a jeweled-bib chiton jersey gown that blousoned at the waist to a deceptively simple coppery column in which the volume and drama were in the back. A languid micro-pleated gown in ivory looked like an ode to fashion's original interpreter of the ancients, Madame Grès.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""d5c44""></div></div><p>The theme could've proven costumey—remember last season's babushkas?—but it wasn't. It was Wang at her romantic best.</p></div>"
201,spring,2008,s2008,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho is celebrating a decade in business. To mark the occasion, images of her clothes in magazines over the years flashed at the back of the runway and a group of girls in argyle capes from her Fall collection marched out to distribute copies of <em>A Magazine</em>, a fashion publication the designer recently guest-curated.</p><p>For Spring, as has been her wont lately, Branquinho treaded ever so lightly among today's trends, making them subtly her own. We've seen lots of long on the runways, and she cut her bright cotton Victorian skirts, tie-dye dresses, and pleated and tiered evening numbers down to the floor. The season's improbably everywhere pant, the dhoti, was in the mix. And the colors were strong: yellow, green, and royal blue. In the midst of all this were several jackets—the best being a lanky black blazer—that demonstrate why she'll still be around in 2017.</p><p>One nagging thought: The anniversary might've offered a chance to explore the sharp yet feminine tailoring that, in the late nineties, won Branquinho legions of fans as fastidious and understated as she is. Witness the fabulous black pantsuit she took her bow in, trailing a silk scarf behind her: It was grown-up and cool, and some in the audience left craving a bit more of the same.</p></div>"
202,spring,2008,s2008,versace,"Versace for Spring was one of those idea-confirming shows where a designer picks out a latent trend and coheres it into critical mass before your very eyes. This season in Milan, it took Donatella Versace to get hold of drapey, flowy, goddessy dressing and make it look hot, easy, and believable. Her beautifully constructed silk jersey dresses—from short togas to open-backed draped shifts and full-on drop-dead gowns—ran the gamut from day to night in a rainbow of colors, with each piece gorgeous in its own right.</p><p>In days gone by, she might have loaded bling and busy prints onto dresses like these, but if there's one thing Versace has discovered in herself in the last couple of years, it's that she can also make glamour radiate from restraint. So for day, she balanced the collection with a vaguely safari-esque sequence of structured tops with floppy satin puffy-pocketed shorts or hybrid pajama/jog pants. Somehow, all this looked luxe and sophisticated—and in these clothes, the models radiated classy sex appeal. When a girl walked out in a drapey beige jumpsuit, the photographers—normally indifferent to wan, blank models—suddenly went nuts. This male form of accolade hasn't been heard on any runway for longer than most people can remember—and for a beige jumpsuit? No, it doesn't sound feasible. But click to the photo, and there you have it: proof that Donatella Versace is at the top of her game.</p></div>"
203,spring,2008,s2008,viktor-rolf,"""Why do birds suddenly appear, every time you are near? Just like me, they long to be close to you."" With Karen Carpenter on the loudspeakers, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren sent out a Harlequin Romance of a Spring collection…but not in the damsel-in-distress-with-her-corset-coming-undone paperback-novel-cover kind of way. It was the myriad double-entendre possibilities of their concept that engaged the surrealism-loving duo, and it made for a charming show.</p><p>After opening with a white duchesse-satin jacket with a Pierrot collar and matching ultrawide pants, and working through several more monochromatic ruffled looks, out fluttered a clue: a long baby-pink dress with diamonds of black lace near the hem. From there, the harlequins came fast and quick, both in literal interpretations (contrasting patent triangles on high-heeled shoes and booties) and in the more abstract (say, a short drop-waist dress with a round, frilled collar resembling the top half of a Commedia dell'Arte clown's outfit).</p><p>As unlikely as it sounds, the white, pink, and black collection with touches of timely wallpaper flowers was as wearable as it was conceptual. (A welcome change after last season, when they made their models wear those ill-conceived lighting and speaker rigs of steel.) Wearable, that is, save for the violins: as an intarsia decoration on a sweater dress, well, OK; but as a necklace, or doubled up and plopped at the shoulders of a long coat? Only fit for a clown.</p></div>"
204,spring,2008,s2008,vivienne-tam,"Two days after the Deitch Art Parade, Vivienne Tam orchestrated her own Soho happening. A cadre of models dressed in gray Mao Zedong suits formed a phalanx around her new flagship, while inside the store—located on the ground level of the Jean Nouvel/André Balazs project on Mercer Street—guests sipped Champagne and took in her 16-piece collection.</p><p>Tam banished Fall's droopy Paul Poiret-inspired silhouette in favor of a leaner line but carried forward her exploration of Chinese paper-cutting methods on fabric. The latter worked to sexy effect on a white and silver-mirror leather dress. Elsewhere, she slashed up an abstract tropical print and appliquéd it back onto textural cocktail dresses, and she hung gold fish-shaped sequins on a simple but fun magenta shift. There was some sophistication here, and it made for an improvement on last season.</p></div>"
205,spring,2008,s2008,vpl,"Victoria Bartlett likes to center her shows around a theme. Last season, the stylist-turned-designer (recently nominated for a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund award) created a cast of suffragettes and other feminist heroes. This time, her collection's title was Shape Shifting Dance, and she dropped the names Martha Graham and Vaslav Nijinsky as visual references. She practiced a few new moves with the introduction of a ""younger, active"" line, VPL II, which was styled into the show, along with lingerie.</p><p>As it happens, activewear is one of this week's emerging trends, and it's something that has consistently been part of Bartlett's design vocabulary. She worked it to her advantage in some of the stonger pieces from the main collection today—bandage swimsuits and color-block leggings reminiscent of the lounge-y body garments dancers in the corps de ballet wear in rehearsal.</p><p>Overall, though, the effort felt cluttered. Minimalism is not Bartlett's thing, but today there was a definite surfeit of layers and accessories. The addition of distracting sculptural showpieces, like the sets of shoulder extenders that looked like nothing so much as football gear, was a misstep.</p></div>"
206,spring,2008,s2008,wunderkind,"If Janis Joplin and Ziggy Stardust had met and run amok in one another's closet, they might've come up with something like Wolfgang Joop's Spring collection. In a departure from both last season's Edwardian tailoring and the severe menswear for which he has such a predilection, Joop went for no-holds-barred glam rock with a boho twist. He layered intricate leopard-spot beadwork over ikat prints, acid satin blazers over dhoti pants, and sporty anoraks over smock dresses—showing it all with wedge platforms worn with colorful ankle socks and the occasional woven fedora. Decorating the edges of coats and jackets, meanwhile, was a red floral bandanna print borrowed from the scarf Joop tied around his neck to take his bow.</p><p>""It all started with this,"" he said, pointing to the bandanna afterward. ""In the beginning, I wanted a West Coast feeling, something natural. But it ended up so crazy, you can't get arrested."" Crazy, maybe, but totally in keeping with one of Spring's prevailing trends: seventies bohemianism. In his third season in Paris, Joop has at last struck the right balance between chic and whimsical, and it made for a lighthearted, fun show.</p></div>"
207,spring,2008,s2008,y-kei,"The husband-and-wife team of Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang studied fashion in San Francisco, so perhaps it isn't surprising that they centered Spring around the idea of ""urban hippies.""</p><p>Yes, fringe hung delicately from an embroidered gray linen chemise, and yes, hand-cut ""feathers"" were appliquéd onto silver metallic fabric, but there were few obvious references to Flower Power here. No denim or tie-dye in sight. The designers said they were more interested in the spirit and ideals of the counterculture than in some sort of Summer of Love retrospective.</p><p>Try as they might, Yoon and Kang are never able to escape prettiness; it isn't necessarily a bad thing. And so a Courrèges-simple sheath had a back belt decorated with romantic flowers, and abstract rosettes bloomed from the bodice of another. The silhouettes were relaxed. Dresses had dolman sleeves. Coats were roomy. This wasn't Y &amp; Kei's most cohesive collection, but by forgoing the runway in favor of a more intimate presentation format and sending out only 16 pieces, they managed to push their meticulous craftsmanship to the fore.</p></div>"
208,spring,2008,s2008,y-3,"Who but Yohji Yamamoto would bring us a thunderstorm on a sunny day? Y-3, backed by Adidas, always has a big production budget, and for Spring that stretched to special-effects weather. Lured to an empty parking garage in the industrial environs of West Chelsea, the audience was surrounded by the ominous boom of thunderclaps and the clatter of heavy rain on the rooftops.</p><p>But this wasn't going to be a dark, dystopian show. There was an optimism in the clothes, with strong pops of color among all the black and white. You sensed a message here, somewhere, about the hybrid line's customer: She is a young urbanite cool enough to thrive in a threatening cityscape.</p><p>Fall's layers had been lightened up. Windbreakers were worn over deconstructed polo-shirtdresses and (more curiously) an ensemble of tank top, sarong, and leggings. Yohji-isms were present here and there, in wide-legged jeans that recaptured his Chaplin look of a few seasons past, or a black Victorian skirt topped by a sporty nylon jacket. Still, all the athletic urbanisms began to get a bit monotonous after a while. A rockabilly getup, complete with creepers and worn by the perfect model, Freja Beha Erichsen, broke things up for a moment, but it was all too brief.</p></div>"
209,spring,2008,s2008,yigal-azrouel,"""If I wasn't in fashion, I'd probably be surfing,"" Yigal Azrouël said in an interview in advance of his show. The designer, who is building a house in Costa Rica, took inspiration from his favorite sport as well as from the ""water and rusticity"" of his South American travels for his Spring collection, which featured muted shots of neon and tie-dye-style prints. He worked plaids, stripes, and ginghams into classics like shirtdresses and Henleys that were designed and styled to look as if they had been lived in—cuffs were rolled, edges unfinished, tees made to appear moth-eaten. These details successfully conveyed the relaxed mood Azrouël was after, but other looks were more contrived. It's hard to imagine the ""cool New York woman"" the designer said he had in mind shelling out for a tuxedo vest with the stuffing coming out of the shoulder. And the bandaging effects on Azrouël's hand-wrapped jute dresses are past their sell-by date. Drapey, Grecian-style dresses, on the other hand, were sophisticated without being stuffy. In the end, though, it felt like the designer was treading water with a collection that had its pleasant moments but didn't attain the crisp focus of his last outing.</p></div>"
210,spring,2008,s2008,yohji-yamamoto,"Once again playing the masculine against the feminine, Yamamoto presented a collection of jumpsuits and hoop skirts. The first look out resembled any number of the all-in-ones that have appeared in droves on other runways—that is, until a closer inspection revealed that the crotch was somewhere around the knees, and the back was spliced and braided to resemble the model's plaited hair. After a number of variations on this theme, a few of which featured lacing at the sides, he offered a counterpoint: a loosely cut jacket with a frogging closure worn over a theatrical, blossoming tiered skirt. It was an apron, really; from the back it looked as if the model were wearing pants.</p><p>Exploring the show's dichotomy, Yamamoto used basic black cotton, metallic silver leather, and glaring bright (by his standards) floral-and-dragon-print jersey. The repetition was broken by asymmetric and poetic draped dresses, many of them shown with a jacket that was worn casually over just one shoulder, hanging slack at the back. The most intricate of these dresses came with silver chains that descended from the neckline to suspend the gathered hem at mid-thigh. And there were other pieces to admire, like a floor-grazing densely ruffled skirt, or a narrower one with multiple panels of fabric arcing horizontally around the knees. But in the end, this collection was less a trove of new ideas than a Yohji refresher course.</p></div>"
211,spring,2008,s2008,zac-posen,"""<em>Days of Heaven</em>, the Shakers, and the wheat fields of the Great Plains"" seem unlikely inspirations for a designer as urban as born-and-bred New Yorker Zac Posen. But there they were, staring up from the front page of his program notes. So it was with an elevated level of curiosity that his audience members—at least the ones there to conduct business; Posen has many boldface pals—awaited the beginning of his show.</p><p>First up was a long black vest with pants and a white shirt, accessorized with a wide-brimmed straw hat perched atop the model's head; it was followed by a halter dress with diagonal tiers of pleats and ruffles. Not such foreign territory for Posen, whose twin talents for tailoring and dramatic eveningwear are well documented in the celebrity weeklies. What was new was the big-sky romance of a white prairie dress rethought as a fitted gown; it had a softness that Posen's more overtly sexy work lacks.</p><p>By the end, though, he had strayed into dangerous pastures. He closed the show with five dresses—four of them long or extra-long; one strapless, short, and bubble-hemmed—that were as poufy as storm-whipped clouds. These were more than a little showy, a country no-no. The Shakers, after all, didn't believe in elaborate details or added decoration. Six-foot trains are one thing, but those staffs of wheat rendered in rhinestones were an inexcusably literal interpretation of the designer's chosen theme.</p></div>"
212,spring,2008,s2008,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo makes directional yet timeless clothes. Her collections change ever so subtly by a process of fine-tuning, not radical change. This makes for a fan base of obsessive collectors, the kind who like to parse the difference between the geometries of one season's sack dress and the next. For close observers, what will make the designer¿s work for spring stand out is the explosive color—there was a long cocooning cardigan in chartreuse, a tangerine sweater dress, and a silk plunge-neck jumpsuit in azure blue.</p><p>Before the show, Cornejo said that she was inspired by nature, especially water. That translated into a jersey dress with a lacquer-shiny panel down the front and a navy patent-leather swing jacket. There was also a glossy white patent tote with black straps that received appreciative glances from many in the room. A graphic print used for a shift dress and a more fitted sheath was, it turns out, an abstracted image of light reflecting on a lake. The irony here is that Cornejo was thinking organic, and she came up with some of the coolest and most urban looks of the week.</p></div>"
213,spring,2008,s2008,3-1-phillip-lim,"A Mercer Street store! A children's line! Eyewear! Perhaps it's all the endless goings-on in the house of Phillip Lim that were making him feel a bit escapist. ""I wanted to make clothes that were ready for travel,"" he said before the show. Amelia Earhart was on his mind.</p><p>The voyage began with his favorite model, Irina Lazareanu, in a khaki coat with epaulets (an easy best seller) over the more directional ensemble of a white shirt with an oversize tie and harem pants. From there the audience was transported in many stylistic directions, from sexy minis with exposed zips to a backless raffia cocktail dress, from a gray cashmere bandeau twinset to a Michael Jackson red leather jacket. Some looks, like a safari jacket over a pleated chiffon dress, made obvious statements about the improvisational nature of dressing on the go.</p><p>Lim's eveningwear sells like hotcakes, and he expanded on the theme with a series of dresses fashioned in the style of Madame Grès, the Parisian mistress of pleats and draping. These were a sure thing for after eight, but it would have been nice to see a newer idea.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""8lbh5wi""></div></div><p>Piece by piece, Spring offered the legions of Lim fans more of what they adore. But, taken as a whole, the message wasn't as coherent as Fall's—and awkward staging didn't help. After their loop on the sloped circular runway, the models placed themselves on a mushroom cluster of round platforms at its center. This caused a bit of confusion among the models and frustration among the photographers. Standing there, Lim's amassed crew looked like a crowd of chic strangers in an airport.</p></div>"
214,spring,2008,s2008,6267,"With Champagne and sugar-dusted fruit greeting guests, it appeared the 6267 duo had taken to heart last season's advice to elevate their production values. The clothes proved equally satisfying. Maybe they'd stacked the standing-room section with friends and fans, or perhaps everyone was just happy to be approaching the end of an at-times-grueling 12-hour day, but Roberto Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano received more sustained applause for more looks than any designer thus far this season.</p><p>Uniting two disparate themes—fifties couture and Japanese samurai, according to the program notes—was a polish that belied the label's still-newcomer status. The fluid silk pants (worn with flowy blouses and swingy vests), floral chine sheaths, and raffia-embroidered miniskirts no doubt set hearts aflutter among the retailers in the audience. These are timely silhouettes that everyone understands, but they were done in a luxurious manner and, even better, were not easily identifiable by brand.</p><p>The show's standout piece suggests, however, that Rimondi and Aquilano have an untapped avant-garde streak: Coming, the dress looked like a sculptural, full-blown trapeze; going, it revealed itself to be a body-skimming, provocative sheath. This two-dresses-in-one trick, in more subtle form, became a recurring motif—as in, for example, a narrow frock that was solid navy in front and a painterly floral in back. Extra points for difficulty, boys. Well done.</p></div>"
1,fall,2008,f2008,a-f-vandevorst,"An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx celebrated the tenth anniversary of their label with a highly choreographed show in which 14 video screens tracked the models' progress from backstage down a flight of stairs to the runway. It was followed by a cocktail party: In place of a finale, waiters streamed out with trays of Champagne. As guests, including the designers' fellow Belgian Dries Van Noten, lingered on the runway, Arickx explained the concept for Fall: ""We noticed that every season there's a dualism to our collections, and this season we decided to play with that more.""</p><p>Hard versus soft and tailoring versus lingerie are among the dualities this husband-and-wife team is best known for. Here, they turned their signature shirting into a kind of foundation; nearly every look began with a black or white button-down and cotton leggings to match. On top, representing the hard part of their oeuvre, they layered narrow, tailored capes or doubled jackets (a single piece that looked like a shrunken suit jacket over a longer one); for the soft alternative, they offered oversize Fair Isle cardigan coats with even bigger scarves, and shiny puffer jackets with split sleeves that ended in mittens.</p><p>A few dresses, worn undone at the back or loosely quilted all over, alluded to the schizophrenia that Arickx mentioned. But others with soft tucks above and below the waist looked perfectly sane, not to mention pretty. The same goes for most of this collection.</p></div>"
2,fall,2008,f2008,abaete,"Fomenting fashion revolution clearly isn't the aim of Abaeté's Laura Poretzky. Rather, the designer continues her quiet evolution—this season, adding tailoring and separates to a previously dress-centric oeuvre. Poretzky's strength is in making ever more understated, chic clothes that are long on commercial appeal, so an inspiration of medieval armor takes shape in a simple steel-gray jersey top tucked into a gray circle skirt, or in the flat pewter paillettes embellishing the waist of an otherwise plain black silk dress. Anything to write home about? Perhaps not. But there is something to be said for ably translating trends into simple, well-priced looks that make an attractive, anonymous addition to a wardrobe. And that something might be, ""Put it on my credit card.""</p></div>"
3,fall,2008,f2008,adam-lippes,"If anyone should understand sophisticated American style it should be Adam Lippes, an alumnus of both Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta, right? For Fall, he borrowed a page from the former and set out into the country for the weekend. There were hand-knit sweaters, herringbone pants, and buffalo-plaid jackets for the girls, and L.L. Bean duck boots for the boys. One of the strongest looks was an ombré mohair wool coat that blended in with the mural of trees on the runway's backdrop. Unfortunately, nothing seemed truly signature or unique, the proceedings were a bit repetitive, and Lippes got rather lost in the woods.</p></div>"
4,fall,2008,f2008,akris,"Albert Kriemler smartly avoided the decorative motifs that distracted from his impeccable tailoring last season. There was a minimalist, almost ascetic appeal to double-faced cashmere suits—the jackets long with high, stand-up collars and narrowed waists, and the trousers with graceful, sleek lines. Anything superfluous was eliminated.</p><p>His coats were also elongated, several grazing the ankle and accessorized with floor-scraping knit or fur scarves. For a more casual take on the pared-down, cleaned-up look, there were streamlined suede tunics over second-skin turtlenecks and slim pants, as well as a horizontally ribbed dolman-sleeved sweater dress worn belted—like everything else—to accentuate the waist.</p><p>The collection wasn't completely free of decoration. Graduated rectangles on silk tulle coat-dresses were more subtle than the mille-feuille layers of organza ribbon at another dress's hem (or, worse, bodice). The strongest evening pieces took their cues from the streamlined daywear: a floor-length cashmere dress with envelope pockets and double-inset pleats, or even simpler, a matte-jersey knife-pleated column with a double skirt in back. All in all, much improved.</p></div>"
5,fall,2008,f2008,alberta-ferretti,"Jewel-like color and peacock blues and greens are a story coming out of Milan, and that's where Alberta Ferretti took her Fall collection. What she does, of course, never strays from the pretty—you wouldn't expect a dramatic departure here—but now it's in a slightly different form. The clothes were less fluttery and with the embellishment toned down, though they still retained the femininity her customers love.</p><p>Instead of drifting, dresses were curved in the hem and gathered into the neckline, like the feather-print satin version that opened the show. Other shapes traced a trapeze line—one of them flowing into accordion pleats in back. Ferretti also paid special attention to making new volumes in coats, using shiny Mikado silk bonded onto a wool lining that holds structure without weight. Still, it was the simplest pieces that drew the eye most: a fine-gauge grape turtleneck worn over a wrapped chiffon skirt; two understated gray-beige draped jersey dresses; and, in the finale, deep purple, emerald, and brown velvets subtly detailed with burned-out effects marking the folds in a raised waistline. They struck a note of restraint that felt right for the mood of the moment.</p></div>"
6,fall,2008,f2008,alessandro-dell-acqua,"In his roundabout way, Alessandro Dell'Acqua always manages to express something pertinent about the current mood. But it certainly wasn't there at the beginning of his collection, when the queasy combination of heavy felted camel-colored corsetry mixed with orange poufy silk (beige with tangerine, help!) had his late-night audience fighting back the urge to charge for the door. Stoicism was eventually rewarded, though. In the show's final passages, the things Dell'Acqua did with black moiré taffeta (a strict high-necked, long-sleeved tailored dress), fur-paneled coats (with perverse chokerlike satin standup collars peeking from beneath), and sheer/opaque/embroidered black dresses made an intriguing counterpart to Miuccia Prada's line of thought about femmes fatales. Quite why there should be a tide of sinister eroticism seeping into things this season is yet to be diagnosed. But it's out there, and Dell'Acqua has sensed it rising.</p></div>"
7,fall,2008,f2008,alexander-mcqueen,"The one element that has gone missing in the collections is the spine-tingling, eye-welling emotion of a show so exceptional to witness that—despite all exhaustion, cynicism, and workaday pressures—it suddenly transforms being involved in fashion into a magical privilege. Just when it seemed like that feeling was virtually extinct, Alexander McQueen handed his audience a self-imagined fantasy of crinolined princesses and British-colonial romance of such beauty, it arguably surpassed anything he's achieved in 14 years.</p><p>""I've got a 600-year-old elm tree in my garden,"" he said, ""and I made up this story of a girl who lives in it and comes out of the darkness to meet a prince and become a queen."" After a trip to India, the designer worked like a fiend for months in his studio, with images of Queen Victoria, the Duke of Wellington, and the Indian Empire running through his mind. They were transformed into ballerina-length multi-flounced dance dresses, each more insanely exquisite than the last: A miraculous red-feather-fronted number turned to burst into a froth of creamy frills in back; another came covered in baby-fine knitted lace; a third had a pair of peacocks—again fashioned from cutout black lace—with their tail feathers fanning out over ivory tulle petticoats.</p><p>Interspersed were rigorously cut military tailcoats with taut pants detailed with military frogging, and slim brocade and cloque pantsuits with crisp white high-necked shirts. Then there was a stately parade of imperial-red and velvet jackets bedecked with millions of dollars' worth of antique Indian diadems and diamond neckpieces, and yet more incredible rich Empire-line saris and wispy dishabille transparencies. These were followed by a sequence of gold-encrusted, ermine-coated glory, echoing the heyday of Norman Hartnell and Hardy Aimes' fifties British couture as worn by Elizabeth II.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""pr8g2r""></div></div><p>Whatever had triggered this new lease of inspired design, it went further than the mere rendition of fanciful costume for the sake of telling a story. Importantly, McQueen finally found it in himself to quash the confining, uptight carapace that had held back former collections, replacing it with a new sense of lightness and femininity. Meanwhile, for all the transporting spectacle and extravagance, the narrative never submerged the sense that, within this wonder, there's plenty to wear, too. No coincidence, then, that McQueen today announced that his company has gone into profit for the first time. It was a day when his brilliance had never shone more brightly.</p></div>"
8,fall,2008,f2008,alexander-wang,"The after-party wouldn't start until five hours later, but Alexander Wang and his stylist/muse Erin Wasson looked more than ready to let loose. Maybe it was the booming music, or the crowd jam-packed into the cavernous Eyebeam Atelier in West Chelsea. Or maybe it was the clothes themselves. The industrial, late-night ambience fit hand in glove with Wang's sexy-tough girls in their ripped tights. Marching out onto the runway from the smoky, scaffolded darkness, they were primed to do battle with whatever got in their way.</p><p>Wang diligently worked his juxtaposition of borrowed-from-the-boys and slinky femininity, producing a slew of great pieces on both sides of the divide. He balanced the proportions of baggy trousers, oversize blazers, and terrific chubby-nubby knits with lean tanks and vests, super-skinny pants, or no pants at all. And he delved for the first time into eveningwear—though more successfully with a louche satin tuxedo and a bugle-beaded vest over black jeans than with pleated chiffon dresses that looked out of place in these grungy environs. His ten-piece collection of slouchy washed-leather bags was a welcome development, however, and one that Wang's army of enthusiasts is guaranteed to adore.</p></div>"
9,fall,2008,f2008,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Hearing a designer comment backstage that he began a collection with a complete disregard for the body, as Alexandre Herchcovitch did after his show, is certainly odd. Instead, the Brazilian downtown darling cited mathematics—geometry, specifically—as the driving force behind his Fall lineup.</p><p>Thankfully, those claims of utter disregard hadn't entirely been borne out on the runway. Though Herchcovitch worked heavily with standaway architectural shapes that had a certain sixties futurism and boxy menswear-inflected tailoring, he maintained a sense of the female form, nipping in the waist of a bubble-skirted dress here or leaving a wool jumpsuit sleeveless there. That sense was more prominent in softly constructed pieces like silk dresses and T-shirts, some pieced together in triangular and rectangular blocks of black fabric and, later, in colors and patterns that underlined the designer's Euclidean motif.</p><p>While the playing out of his ideas on the runway was interesting and will easily sate Herchcovitch aficionados, the moment of full realization never seemed to arrive. Herchcovitch's vision is, as ever, an engaging one to have in New York, but Fall's show lacked the clarity of seasons past.</p></div>"
10,fall,2008,f2008,allegra-hicks,"After building a following on her caftans, it was inevitable that Allegra Hicks would want to challenge herself more as a designer. There's a whole world of structure out there to explore. Hence, tailored items like the lamé pinstripe suit and the brocade cocktail dress in this collection. The tailoring lacked the necessary precision, however. Hicks fared better when she kept things simple, wrapped, and draped—she claimed as inspiration the dress worn by Ballets Russes dancer Olga Khokhlova in Picasso's 1917 portrait. One silk-jersey wrap dress, called Fifty-Four, was also surely a tip of the cap to erstwhile disco queen Diane von Furstenberg.</p><p>That was a reminder that Hicks herself is the linchpin of a glamorous set. Presumably, it was her friends she had in mind when she came up with a collection that slotted so completely into the category once called After Five. If that sounds a little, um, <em>square</em> in our own era, then there was also something a little square about these clothes. A velvet opera coat with fox-trimmed sleeves or a coat of silver leather ribbed with fur (and worn with tweed lamé trousers) offered the Hicksettes a kind of antique glamour curiously at odds with what one imagines to be their lifestyles.</p></div>"
11,fall,2008,f2008,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"Dame Vivienne has always covered her clothes with doodles. This season, she went straight to the source, enlisting 7- and 8-year-old students from the Portland School in Nottingham, England, to hand-paint most of the pieces in her new collection. But it wasn't exactly child's play. After briefing them on the global-warming crisis, she asked them to imagine a society of jungle-dwelling eco-warriors. The clothes that resulted are the warriors' uniform.</p><p>There were capes and ponchos in tartans spliced to resemble camouflage, fake-fur hoodies and pants, and real shearling jackets adorned with primary-colored butterflies, flowers, and snakes. Ribbed-knit cardigans wrapped haphazardly around the torso, skirts had paper-bag waists, and pants drooped to the knees. For those moments when the freedom fighters ventured into the city, Westwood offered unembellished taffeta evening suits and dresses with portrait necklines.</p><p>It's hard to see the real-life urban-jungle application of many of the more decorated pieces, but the agitprop was actually less heavy-handed than it has been in the past. Chalk it up to the Portland schoolkids in the front row, or maybe the stilt walkers (one wore a pinstriped pantsuit with slung-back shoulders, the other a lush green ball gown aswirl with paint): As serious as Westwood's message remains, this was still a feel-good show.</p></div>"
12,fall,2008,f2008,andrew-gn,"At least two things were different.</p><p>First, where were the skirts? Andrew Gn is a leg man, but instead of the above-the-knee styles and pencil numbers his clients love him for, he stuck mostly to pants. And great ones, too, in the softest cashmere—cropped with a row of buttons rising from the ankle to mid-calf, or straight and leg-lengthening with a raised waist and the tiniest flare.</p><p>Second, what happened to the colors and prints and, for that matter, embroideries—all hallmarks of this seven-year-old house? The flash factor had definitely been taken down a notch or two.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6ih4ls""></div></div><p>Well, Gn's dark, sophisticated new palette aligned nicely with the Paris season. So, too, did his now more understated embellishments, like the basket-weave detailing at the collar and cuffs of a cashmere redingote, the hand-finished organza yoke of a high-necked silk blouse, and the braided waistband of a satin cocktail dress.</p><p>The real question, of course, is whether or not the designer's high-flying fan club will take to the edgier, less overtly feminine look. Considering that the clothes—even the youngest-looking silk satin dresses with the tented backs—were every bit as couture as they've been in the past, we'd say the odds are in his favor.</p></div>"
13,fall,2008,f2008,ann-demeulemeester,"The girls and boys in the Ann gang are slouching into a purplish patch for Fall. It's not far off their beaten path—you'd never expect that—but somewhere along the line, they've picked up an extra layer of mauve ombré-dyed Mongolian lamb, purple-painted shearlings, and maroon-fringed goat hair for winter. Demeulemeester deserves kudos, however, as her crowd never looks as if it's trailing off into Woodstock-slash-boho-rock-'n'-roll-retro costume. She's one of those people whose personal sense of indie cool goes to the bone, and never involves looking back or trying too hard.</p><p>Things do change by calibrations, though, and this season it was in the proportions created by a wraparound tunic-length top or jacket, and pants tucked into high-laced knee boots. There was still plenty of black and examples of the Demeulemeester cutaway redingote, but they were leavened by a smattering of flower-print and fringed silk jackets. Best, though, was the modernization of this season's by now clichéd seventies chubby—in Demeulemeester's hands it became an asymmetric, high-wrapped cream Mongolian lamb stole with the tips dyed a cool shade of urban grime.</p></div>"
14,fall,2008,f2008,anna-sui,"Backstage, Anna Sui ticked off her references: the aesthetic movement, pre-Raphaelites, Tiffany vases, Fortuny pleats, medievalism, Gustav Klimt, and, oh, yes, the American Indians of the Pacific Northwest. A beautiful mess? To some, maybe. But to her fans, watching the new and different ways she loops together her encyclopedic appreciation of fashion history each season is nothing less than a pure delight. With its iridescent prints, lively color combinations, and Art Nouveau-ish embroideries—to say nothing of the tooled-leather boots, velvet flower headpieces, beaded necklaces, and paisley tights—her Fall collection ranks among her most exuberant.</p><p>In no particular order, she showed a stained-glass bird-motif smock worn over a totem pole-print top, a white faux-suede fringed dress, a metallic lamé space-dyed cape, a multi-print caftan edged in python lamé, a curly lamb coat in ultramarine, and a black-and-cream Tibetan goat capelet. The cumulative effect? Very late sixties. ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" was playing on the sound system, and somewhere the Beatles' guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who died earlier this week at the age of 91, was smiling.</p></div>"
15,fall,2008,f2008,anne-valerie-hash,"She's fresh off a well-received haute couture show, so it was disappointing to see her stumble. Anne Valérie Hash's Fall ready-to-wear followed the lead, she said, of her made-to-measure work, and the geometric constructions she experimented with in January (seen elsewhere this season, too) were back—but with almost too much verve. A cocktail dress pieced together from molded bits of aqua and salmon silk was amusing in its eccentric way, but three-dimensional jacket lapels and shoulders that resembled dodecahedrons were over-conceptualized and overdone.</p><p>Ponyskin and fur are new materials for Hash. They worked best in smaller doses: Black ponyskin on the collar of a black cashmere coat worn with matching trousers was elegant, but a fitted, high-neck top and matching narrow skirt in the same stuff? Too much. The show's strongest piece was its simplest: a sleeveless embossed black leather sheath with the womanly shape that the designer said she was going for. The more complicated structures only served to obscure the models' forms; and there was nothing obviously feminine about her Prince of Wales checks, either. Hash has already shown herself to be quite accomplished at cut. If she scaled back her ambitions—and enthusiasms—those talents would rise to the surface.</p></div>"
16,fall,2008,f2008,antonio-berardi,"""It's very austere,"" said Antonio Berardi. ""That's what people seem to want from me."" He opened with the kind of strict, sexy tailoring—in black, naturally—that he's been doing since the last time ""austere"" was a buzzword. Jackets and coats with fine boning fit like a glove in front, but their backs were left free; an hourglass sheath clung to every curve, all 360 degrees. Also in the plus column was an interlude of thirties-style bias-cut gowns.</p><p>But Berardi only got his formula half right.</p><p>Where he went wrong was with the furs, piecing together gray mink to resemble a human spine and dying an enormous coat a too-vivid shade of yellow. The finale gowns were a bit of a puzzle, too. Stretch-mesh minidresses embroidered all over like armor were Berardi at his body-conscious best, so why did he add billowy capes as big as parachutes?</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""3rymj9""></div></div><p>Backstage, he boasted that after increasing prices on his pre-fall collection, sales had gone up 50 percent. But the runway-only looks that made up a percentage of today's show won't do anything for his burgeoning bottom line.</p></div>"
17,fall,2008,f2008,aquascutum,"Aquascutum's designers, Michael Herz and Graeme Fidler, set themselves two missions this season: to research the company's origins in 1851, and to delve into the vintage highlights in the company's archives. What they found there: excellent examples of militaria (since Aquascutum, like Burberry, outfitted soldiers for the trenches) and some stately English ladies' coats derived from fifties couture. It takes more than that to make a rounded, modern runway show, though, so the designers concentrated on bringing bright color and texture to dresses to perk up the outerwear.</p><p>In the sequence of the show, the coats came out first in a lot of variety: a khaki officer's greatcoat (double-breasted and long, a London trend), a molded bright-blue bouclé collarless style, and a fit-and-flare gold-and-mustard jacquard hourglass being three of them. The lack of a consistent shape running through the show looked puzzling, until the outerwear came out again slipped over colorful embroidered wool or one-color dresses in turquoise, burnt orange, and red. Then the designers' combined eye for color made the show jump alive: a dark bordeaux coat with a red dress, a khaki trench over orange, yellow with red, and so on. It may seem simplistic, but sometimes it's those little footnotes on how to wear things differently that end up being the most inspiring point of a whole show.</p></div>"
18,fall,2008,f2008,armand-basi-one,"Markus Lupfer's second London showing of the Spanish brand Armand Basi was a bouncy essay in exaggerated volume and color. Overblown trapezes; dresses with bunchy, standout gatherings above the waist; and A-line jackets with giant flounces seemed almost deliberately awkward and doll-like. ""It's about having fun with clothes and enjoying color,"" said Lupfer. He didn't exactly hit on anything new—inflated, sub-Balenciaga shapes have been exhaustively exploited by fashion over the past couple of years—but the color combinations (orange, magenta, peacock blue, green, and pink) were luscious and the materials couture standard. Exactly what such extravagant cloques, failles, matelassés, and minks (there <em>was</em> a nice gray cocoon edge-to-edge coat midway through) are doing at this label is puzzling, though. If you came expecting to see a collection consistent with a mid- to upper-level sportswear firm that makes easy clothes for young girls (its established identity over some years), you left feeling bemused.</p></div>"
19,fall,2008,f2008,badgley-mischka,"Mark Badgley and James Mischka said Bianca Jagger was their woman for Fall. Clues that the seventies were the duo's starting point included a brick-red crinkled leather jacket worn with a matching, flared above-the-knee skirt; and an apricot turtleneck and boot-cut glen plaid pants worn with a little broadtail-and-fox vest.</p><p>They aren't the kind of designers to launch themselves willy-nilly into a theme. So worked in among the floral shirtwaists, floppy felt hats, and high suede boots were the kind of reliable, timeless clothes that the ladies who lunch live for: a pencil skirtsuit in a buff tweed shot through with metallic thread, or wool crepe tuxedo pants worn with a chiffon blouse and a little silk faille jacket with short mink sleeves.</p><p>Badgley Mischka's daywear is always sensible enough, and this season is no different. But anyone with a Bergdorf's charge card knows that their raison d'être is eveningwear. Two of the best gala looks were an amethyst organza creation hand-painted with impressionistic flowers, and a strapless bustier style with a lace overlay studded with crystals. The spare elegance of these looks made you wish the boys had left the silver and gold sequins, splashed liberally on other big-night dresses, back at the disco.</p></div>"
20,fall,2008,f2008,balenciaga,"""I wanted something austere,"" said Nicolas Ghesquière, ""but with a bit of Spanish drama. It's quite cinematographic, an idea of film noir, like Simone Signoret in <em>Les Diaboliques</em>—but it's really me exploring the DNA of the house, with my sci-fi things going on with the plastics and latex."" The result: an extraordinary synthesis of rigorous line and shiny, high-tech surfaces illuminated at necks and wrists by the sparkling opulence of traditional jewelry. A different parure of necklace and bracelets adorned every outfit—34 uniquely breathtaking configurations of crystal, faux gems, and pearls, some of them archive copies, others new.</p><p>The genius of Ghesquière's Balenciaga is that he can extrude something so smoothly modern from so many layered references. It hit from the opening looks: molded black dresses with scrolled peplums, slit skirts, and armband sleeves—fifties cocktail catapulted into a fierce kind of twenty-first-century chic. (NB: Cristobal Balenciaga was born in the Basque country, hence the ""Spanish"" drama.) The clever part is the way Ghesquière melds his own vision—his taste for techno surfaces—with Balenciaga's heritage, often in the same garment—say, the car-shiny dresses cut with a swag back, or the sliced zones of shantung and plastic that are fused into a sack dress. There was much more beyond this, too: on the one hand, crazily elaborate ""couture"" latex, formed into hand-painted and embossed samurai biker jackets and dresses inspired by chinoiserie screens, and on the other, a few perfectly resolved urban equations for a new kind of evening dressing. The best: the skinny gray pants and Goya-inspired draped velvet and taffeta tops—superb.</p></div>"
21,fall,2008,f2008,balmain,"""It's more hard rock and punk this season,"" said Christophe Decarnin backstage before the show. And as promised, Spring's haute hippie feathers, fringe, and tie-dye were replaced by an all-Billy Idol soundtrack and enough leopard-print chain mail, python-pattern denim, and crystal-embroidered lightning bolts to make you wonder if there was anything at all left on the shelves at Trash and Vaudeville. To be fair, Decarnin's creations are much finer than the East Village emporium's, but they appeal to a similar kind of chick, one with a killer body and an active nightlife.</p><p>This designer doesn't put much stock in day clothes. In a word, his show was about legs. Bare legs. But there were a few cool looks that model types could pull off reasonably well during traditional business hours. They usually involved narrow-shouldered little jackets, loose cotton tanks or tees, and skinny tuxedo pants or jeans cropped a couple of inches above moccasin-fringe ankle boots. Dhoti pants were back again, this time in a substantial leather. Four seasons in, Decarnin is building a following: Earlier incarnations of those tricky dhotis could be spotted on a number of influential editors in the front row.</p></div>"
22,fall,2008,f2008,band-of-outsiders,"A trip to the Scottish countryside, taking in a fabric mill or two along the way, was the inspiration behind Scott Sternberg's Fall collection. But this was no Highland Fling in the Alexander McQueen meaning of the phrase. Sternberg, a CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund nominee, has built a cult following on his tweaks on traditional schoolboy/girl style, and he mostly stuck to that engaging, low-key formula for Fall. There were cashmere rugbys worn with windowpane plaid minis and a drop-waist shirtdress in a brushed-cotton checked twill. But, said Sternberg, ""I wanted her to grow up a little and to do something romantic, too."" So also in the lineup were a sublimely simple camel coat with leather buttons, another in midnight with a luxe raccoon collar, and the show's standout look, a gray flannel three-piece suit with a smart double-breasted vest and full, flaring pants. Adding to the charm was the set: a 1940s living room that looked like it had been invaded by a Scottish forest.</p></div>"
23,fall,2008,f2008,barbara-tfank,"A rush-hour show on the Upper East Side? Not a problem, when your clientele lives in the neighborhood. And they were right on time: Blaine Trump, Sheryl Schwartz, Milly de Cabrol, Marina Rust Connor, and Amy Fine Collins.</p><p>Barbara Tfank cited as inspiration the striking color and strong black line of <em>Three Women</em>, a painting by the Cubist Fernand Léger. But no matter her spark, Tfank always hews close to her elegant ethos, gently limning each season's ideas in feathery strokes. For Fall, her ladylike fare, cut in typically rich textiles, was joined by newly casual wares: soft coats and pants in plain heathered wool. These were as soigné as one would expect but much more ""day"" than Tfank has ever done before. And smack in the middle of a series of proper gold, black, and silver evening looks came the shock of an almost bohemian pleated ombré silk column in fuchsia and lipstick red. It was just one gesture, a brief moment, but an intriguing insight into what this designer can do when she steps outside her accustomed genre.</p></div>"
24,fall,2008,f2008,bcbg-max-azria,"What a difference a year makes. In 12 little months, BCBG Max Azria has blossomed from a girl into a woman, with a Fall collection of elegant jersey dancer dresses and (admittedly, a bit more awkward) Katharine Hepburn-style tailoring—all in a restrained, dare we say sober, palette. ""BCBG has evolved so many times,"" says creative director Lubov Azria backstage. ""This is a direction that feels wearable and clean."" All of New York seems to be growing up this season, actually, as—at least judging from the early shows—body-conscious sophistication is finally toppling the cult of the sack. Here, every look was cinched at the waist with a rugged leather and wool belt, which also added a needed edge to soigné silhouettes. Details like trapunto seaming, cartridge pleats, and sexy flashes of skin did the same. As the show progressed, the girlishness that is still a necessary component of a contemporary line finally reared its pretty little head in minidresses of colored satin and pleated silk crepe short enough to qualify for the ""Dress or blouse?"" guessing game. Just the dose of fun the doctor ordered.</p></div>"
25,fall,2008,f2008,behnaz-sarafpour,"<em>Qui êtes-vous</em>, Behnaz Sarafpour? Once upon a time we knew—a girl who made pretty, uptown-chic dresses for young, spirited, millennial Holly Golightlys. (And goodness knows there are more of them than ever these days!) But, as of late, Sarafpour seems to have been trying on too many different aesthetic hats. Undeniably, Tuesday night's show had many stylish moments, but they also felt slightly disparate.</p><p>Like last season, she began with a series of eco-friendly looks, among them wool minidresses with a leaf appliqué (and shades of Lanvin) that looked impressively un-granola. From there, the collection was by turns aggressive, in little silk dresses topped with beastly goat-hair jackets; modern, in a photo-print floral minidress; ladylike, in a glazed satin trench; and then bohemian, in lovely and breezy ruffled dresses. Glimpses of Sarafpour's original direction were present, too, such as a crinkled plum shift with a trompe l'oeil bow neck—a reminder of what this industry darling can do.</p></div>"
26,fall,2008,f2008,benjamin-cho,"""It sounds kind of weird, but I literally craft day and night.""</p><p>Standing backstage before his show, amid heavily embroidered harnesses and a white wool deer's head (more on that in a minute), downtown fixture Benjamin Cho was making a convincing case that he's not all play and no work. For the past couple of months, the designer has been holed up in his apartment with artist friends like Tony Cox and Dan Colen, hand-finessing his appliquéd, spliced, woven, printed, and layered Fall 2008 collection. ""When stores like Colette order,"" he said, discussing his more labor-intensive, intricately wrought garments, ""that's what they want.""</p><p>But despite the crafty basis of the collection, there were items here to appeal to buyers outside the Colette-Barneys axis. The pieced cocktail dresses with sequin underlays, for example, are as close to the mainstream as Cho cares to get. Not that he's forgotten his core fan base of art school girls and those who love them: The deer headpiece, which came complete with antlers and topped a knit slipdress ensemble, was vintage Cho. And it got a big round of applause from his friends in the crowd.</p></div>"
27,fall,2008,f2008,betsey-johnson,"The physical location of Betsey Johnson's beatnik romp was Bryant Park, but the imaginary setting was a dark and smoky joint in the Village like the Bottom Line or the Bitter End. Johnson went all out (no surprise there): Her set had bare lightbulbs and tables topped with straw-covered Chianti bottles and copies of <em>On the Road</em>. There were even three bongo players in striped shirts at the end of the runway smoking faux Gauloises. ""I've got to have an environment that you can enter into because I get so terrified of showing clothes,"" Johnson admitted.</p><p>The show, which opened with a great fringed leather jacket, featured viable mix-and-match pieces like a twill blazer, a suede wrap skirt, a zebra cardigan, Lurex leopard leggings, and a sexy stretch-denim catsuit that would be great for layering. ""This collection is a real flip for me, in that I'm going very dark, beatnik, black, bold, slim-lined, and leotardic,"" the ever-bumptious designer said. ""It's kick-ass with a harder hard edge, in a Joan Jett kind of way.""</p><p>Johnson is celebrating 30 years in the business, and she closed the show with an anniversary march of archival pieces sourced from vintage dealers. The parallels between Fall and the looks in the retrospective were unexpectedly clear. ""It's interesting,"" she said, sounding surprised herself. ""You see there's a timelessness to this stuff.""</p></div>"
28,fall,2008,f2008,bill-blass,"For his debut at Blass, Peter Som played with ""a mix of luxurious opposites"": masculine/feminine, high/low, day/evening. So, to a remix of Depeche Mode's 1990 proto-emo hit ""Enjoy the Silence,"" models marched in jaunty outfits inspired by original Blass lookbooks from 1969 and 1970. ""I was fascinated by the clothes, but also by the photographs, which are beautiful in themselves and tell so much about a place in time,"" Som said. There was a refreshing splash of woman-power appeal in the trouser suits and sharp tuxedos, which traded punches with a cadre of cocktail dresses dramatized with elaborate beading, feathers, and eyelash fringe. Although Som said he pictures the Blass woman as a bit more pragmatic than the woman who wears his own Peter Som label, this collection tilted more toward dressing up than dressing down. No, it wasn't the Second Coming, but it was a promising first go.</p></div>"
29,fall,2008,f2008,blumarine,"Anna Molinari's new Blumarine shop on the Avenue Montaigne was the ostensible inspiration for her Fall line—a photograph of the storefront was projected on a screen behind the runway, and an aerial view of the famous Parisian thoroughfare was emblazoned on the outside of her tent. But the feel of the clothes themselves was less French than homegrown; it looked as if Molinari had stolen a page from her countryman Roberto Cavalli's vampy playbook. The show opened with lace-edged silk slipdresses topped by fluffy angora cardigans in matching candy shades. No matter the hour of the day or night, it's apparently never too early for a bit of sparkle: A puffer vest worn with a white blouse and bell-bottom jeans was just as likely to be embellished with sequins as a draped jersey gown. And there was even a racy overscale leopard print. She used it for a trench, a plunge-front dress, and a strapless frock with a flirty ruffled bodice.</p><p>This collection was Molinari playing against type—it happened to work on that leopard-print strapless dress, but more often it came off as, well, a little tarty. Those who miss her signature sweetness will have to settle for a blush-pink bejeweled cardigan worn with a frilly skirt in a matching shade of chiffon—or wait for next season.</p></div>"
30,fall,2008,f2008,bottega-veneta,"The fact that a grateful gasp of pleasure can pass through a room at the sight of an amazingly cut peacoat, the collar chicly turned up, over a pair of gray flannel pants says something significant about the state of fashion right now. It came at number 15 in the Bottega Veneta lineup—the defining moment at which it became clear that Tomas Maier's collection was making sense of the hunger for a new kind of simplicity in a quite brilliant way. He did it with tailoring and he did it with a stunning variety of draped and pieced dresses, making one of the season's most convincing arguments yet for a longer line.</p><p>""I wanted something effortless"" is the way Maier described his liquid, wrapped jerseys and gauzy wool dresses. ""I let the material dictate an elongated line, something that would look as if fabric was just running down the body."" Effortless and pulled together it was: dresses, tights, and shoes each shaded in one-color silhouettes taken from the dusk-to-dawn tints of a night sky. One outstanding nude-toned dress could be pulled over the head and simply tied at the hip. Others were constructed from patchworks of compact gray jersey to form cap sleeves and trace the torso. To go with all this, there were gorgeous accessories that underlined the sense of elegant restraint: matte crocodile bags with a fold-over frame top; a new dense, dark suede on the flanks of a handheld tote; perfectly balanced pumps with a sliver of a platform. Totally thought through, beautiful, and wearable, this collection ranks Maier as a designer working at an extraordinary level of technical accomplishment, and sensitivity to the kind of women who wear his clothes.</p></div>"
31,fall,2008,f2008,brian-reyes,"New York is well populated with young designers these days, which makes it interesting to watch and see who will ascend from newest-latest to the next tier up. With his Fall collection, shown to an enviable crowd in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza, Reyes proved that he is indeed on the rise.</p><p>He began his career in the atelier of Oscar de la Renta, and he carries the experience with him: His work is skewed toward an uptown, luxe-loving clientele. But he is also eager to experiment and find his own voice. You could see it in the capes and coats, especially those belted over matching dresses, which required more than a passing glance to decipher where one began and the other ended. The effect was mostly more intriguing than messy, but that wasn't the case for another element used throughout: a clunky, squared-off racer back on dresses in jewel-toned satins or granite-print chiffon. Reyes slalomed between soigné and sporty, woman and girl, but was best when he struck a balance. Uptown glamour served straight up in a fuchsia moiré evening trench was undeniably pretty and rich, but it was the youthful polish of a hunter silk anorak that held the eye.</p></div>"
32,fall,2008,f2008,bruno-pieters,"Androgyny isn't a word that has passed many lips this season, but it was a mini-theme on the first day of the Paris shows, beginning with Bruno Pieters.</p><p>Here, masculine fare—boxy, loose camel jackets and pleat-front pants, oversize trenches, and skinny ties not unlike those favored by the Belgian designer himself—shared the runway with rounder, more feminine shapes, like a shift in a black-and-gold overscale houndstooth, a short cape in stiff silver lamé, and a couple of blouson sweaters. Standouts on the male side of the equation included a jacket with what appeared to be a built-in waistcoat, and, on the other end, a soft, dolman-sleeve cocoon coat. A cropped blazer worn over a tuxedo shirt and floor-length skirt with a knit scarf wrapped obi-style at the waist fell somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Sometimes the show's mixed message became a little fuzzy. Unwieldy layers (jacket over turtleneck over pleated Elizabethan ruff; coat over skirt over skinny pants) obscured the beauty of the clean, precise lines of Pieters' tailoring.</p></div>"
33,fall,2008,f2008,burberry-prorsum,"Christopher Bailey has so many people to please in his job at Burberry that the scale of the task would daunt anyone: There are the young girls dipping in for the occasional cute, inexpensive piece; the super-luxury sophisticates (who cleaned the label's stores out of python coats last spring); the legions of customers living in vastly differing climates from Bal Harbour to Boston to Beijing. Backstage before the show, the designer was explaining how he went about squaring that massive circle for Fall: with busbylike wool beanies; plain, girl-friendly overcoats; and ""trumpet"" flares, on the one hand; and on the other, with extraordinarily worked, couturelike outerwear constructed from tiered feathers, suede ""sequins,"" and fringed leather leaves.</p><p>""I've been looking at L.S. Lowry,"" Bailey explained, citing the Northern English painter of industrial landscapes and ""matchstick"" people. ""He painted all these ladies walking around in funny hats and coats."" If that gave him a conveniently British jumping-off point for the collection, it didn't lead anywhere literal. Instead, Bailey put his focus on proportion. He began by balancing a short silhouette (coats came curved into the hem) over long, skinny legs walking on high platforms, then worked in his great-looking bootlegs with boyish jackets in menswear fabrics. As the collection segued to the luxury end, the handcrafted coats became ever more complex and textured: in multi-pleated, knotted strips of organza; pieces of fox fur cut out and re-appliquéd; piled-up shredded leaves of chiffon. Accomplished as these were, though, it was the more pragmatic, younger end of the collection that recaptured some of the freshness the collection has been missing in the past couple of seasons.</p></div>"
34,fall,2008,f2008,calvin-klein-collection,"In nearly five years at Calvin Klein, Francisco Costa has proven that he's the most precise of designers, and his Fall collection was almost regimental in its discipline. The models were nearly makeup-free, their hair pulled back in severe ponytails, and the clothes were just as uncompromising.</p><p>After Spring's dress-heavy lineup, Costa zeroed in on tailoring, opening with a cashmere mantle coat in deepest navy that topped a fitted shirt and a straight-line skirt. Their clean surfaces set an austere mood from which the designer hardly deviated. A color-blocked A-line shift followed a collarless jacket worn with pencil-thin leggings, and an overscale, boxy men's jacket followed an asymmetrical, away-from-the-body boiled wool dress. Two coats, one single-breasted, the other double (not that there was a button or closure to be seen), were deceptively simple and simply beautiful. Other toppers were razor-cut at the lapels to reveal a flash of what the model was wearing underneath.</p><p>Costa has had a big year, crisscrossing the globe several times to promote the brand and cultivating important celebrity relationships along the way. Liv Tyler, who was to co-host his after-party at the Waverly Inn, sat front and center, next to Ali Larter. It's curious, then, that the designer showed only three special-occasion dresses: accordion-pleat gowns that draped from one shoulder or dipped low in front. Their metallic silk glittered under the runway lights, but it wasn't quite enough to generate real fashion excitement. Indeed, the audience for a collection as rigorous as this may be limited. Still, fans of Costa's brand of minimalism came away more than satisfied.</p></div>"
35,fall,2008,f2008,carlos-miele,"Last season, we saw Carlos Miele in the midst of a clean-up act, jettisoning some of the excess that has previously weighed down his collections. His Fall show was an evolution of the same process, with the designer trying harder than ever to utilize his powers of restraint—insofar as that's allowed under Brazilian law. Fresh off the accomplishment of designing his 8,000-square-foot São Paulo boutique and his beach house on the island of Florianópolis, Miele had architecture on the brain. In seasons past, this reference wouldn't have been subtle, but here he worked it gently into the curved seams and twisted straps of colorful, fluid gowns that snaked gracefully around the body, and into the texture of square pleating on coats, skirts, and sculptural cable knits. An injection of menswear—particularly a black blazer worn over an evening skirt—was unexpected but wholly welcome: It was a great counterpoint to Miele's typical va-va-voom femininity. With his new ad campaign now hitting magazines, the designer's more restrained approach is picking up steam.</p></div>"
36,fall,2008,f2008,carolina-herrera,"The drawing rooms of the Upper East Side that inspired Herrera's Spring show have been replaced by the wide-open spaces of the countryside. But don't think the designer has skimped on the luxury or the embellishments. Trading in painterly florals for a bird print embroidered with marabou feathers, and polka dots for windowpane plaids, she focused primarily on separates: dramatic capes over matching jackets and long, slim pants; cashmere vests layered over printed chiffon blouses and riding pants. A robust tweed overlaid with multicolored organza turned up on a double-breasted vest and a long coat with an exuberantly patterned lining. And there were riding jackets, as her program notes explained, ""to grab from the mudroom, over a crinkle chiffon gown for an elegant dinner on the farm."" Driving home the rustic-chic message were slouchy, high-heel riding boots and tartan fedoras decked with extravagantly long feathers that bobbed in the runway breeze.</p><p>Minus the over-the-top accessories and without the omnipresent feathers—all that fresh air can apparently go to a girl's head—most of the pieces could play in the city. Velvet jeans might easily become a staple in Herrera's crowd. A long chartreuse chiffon dress with an asymmetric neckline and a floral jacquard vest worn over a corseted china-blue gown trailing several feet of gazar in its wake are both obviously destined for the Park Avenue party circuit. And wouldn't it be a shame to waste those gorgeous furs (from a cashmere hoodie with patches of mink right on up to the conspicuously grand swakara swing coat) on Sagaponack or Deer Isle, where there's hardly anyone to see you?</p></div>"
37,fall,2008,f2008,catherine-malandrino,"Catherine Malandrino began her Fall collection musing over the art of Claude and François-Xavier Lalanne, the French sculptors beloved by fashion folk from Pierre Bergé to Reed Krakoff. The Lalannes' often fantastical creations draw heavily on flora and fauna, and Malandrino conjured an enchanted garden on her runway.</p><p>The first look set the Gallic wood-nymph tone: an emerald silk shift with an intricate, openwork hem topped by an organza-leaf bolero that looked like Edward Scissorhands had cut it fresh this morning. It made the point, if not subtly. Malandrino is a designer who loves a motif, hence her liberal use of green and other woodsy hues, the introduction of an abstract leaf print, and the presence of that foliaged organza. Sweater-dressing was an integral part of the story (see the webby gowns, flirty little suits, and beastly bouclé cashmere jumpers), as was volume (the cocooned sleeves and linebacker shoulders). A bit much? At times, yes, but the excess was tempered by moments of simplicity, like a crocheted column gown with a matching leather bolero, both in basic black.</p></div>"
38,fall,2008,f2008,celine,"Celine is one of those minor-league labels that, in the absence of any fixed identity of its own, is destined to play along with the trends in order to keep up its claim to being a part of things. In that sense, its show acted as a kind of general weather forecast for winter. Heading this way: one-color silhouettes in double-face cashmere, funnel necks and eighties-type Montana-Mugler top-seaming, fur-zoned coats, armor influences, metallic paillettes, overlapping curviform cutting, statement neckpieces, and sculptured wedges in the footwear department.</p><p>To give Celine designer Ivana Omazic her due, she accurately registered all these movements in the fashion ether, while giving them a kind of sports spin—a cashmere hoodie and fur-smothered parka here, a crocodile motorcycle jacket there, and a couple of luxury rucksacks inserted into the back view of raincoats. By the end, a gearchange for evening led the collection into goth-y monkey-fur jackets and long black fluted skirts—admittedly nothing to do with the way the show started out, but still a look that is taking off elsewhere. If there was nothing much ""wrong"" with all this—except for the long passage of overwrought layered skirted effects—it's still hard to see what, exactly, would make a customer want to shop this label above so many others who are doing more or less the same thing.</p></div>"
39,fall,2008,f2008,central-saint-martins,"The Central Saint Martins M.A. class of 2008 had a lot to live up to—if they had any doubt about that, they could have glanced at the front row and gotten very nervous indeed. There were the alumni who have gone before them to spark up London fashion week: Christopher Kane, Marios Schwab, Richard Nicoll, and Todd Lynn. (Louise Goldin, this year's knitwear sensation, would have been there too, but was ill in bed with the flu.) Also gathered were ranks of industry professionals, buyers, and fashion executives from Puma, who were giving out prizes for accessory design (€40,000 worth of Saint Martins student-designed trainers were sold in stores last year).</p><p>Why do all and sundry turn out to inspect what is, after all, a student show? Partly to take the temperature of what young people are thinking, and partly to be first to crown the next star. This year, though, was a quiet one, with only a couple of outstanding collections. The first was from Mary Katrantzou, who used giant trompe l'oeil digital prints on bonded jersey dresses in the shape of necklaces. The other was by Simone Shailes—she swept up a L'Oréal trophy for her loopy cardigans and sweaters made out of chunky fringed tiers, which had been inspired, she explained, by ""girls with funny big hairdos."" Shailes is another talent to join the likes of Louise Goldin, Clare Tough, Sid Bryan, and Hans Christian Madsen, who are knitting up a minor storm in London—collectively stirring interest in extreme, cobwebby, multi-patterned, and sculpturally textural effects (and a rising craze for woolly chubbies). On the whole, though, an unusually subdued and polite cohort passed out of Central Saint Martins this year, a group more focused on making wearable clothes in beige, black, and white than rocking the house. Is that a sign of the times?</p></div>"
40,fall,2008,f2008,chalayan,"Something amazing took place at Hussein Chalayan's show: Models broke out in smiles. Not stilted smiles they'd been ordered to wear, but the spontaneous human variety that indicates actual enjoyment. Suddenly you thought: Good Lord, there are <em>people</em> inside these girls! They are actually…<em>living individuals</em>!</p><p>This was not the intended revelation of Chalayan's collection, but as an accidental by-product, it made a serendipitous contribution to what he was saying. ""Generally, I'm interested in how we are as human beings,"" he said after the show. ""I think of my work as a kind of life science."" Chalayan's concept was an abstract story about the evolution of humanity, which was accompanied by an a cappella group who struck up an extraordinary vocal timpani simulating prelife space sounds, jungle noises, and folkloric and religious chants.</p><p>So was it the group that started to crack the models up? Or was it that naughty Coco Rocha, who advanced toward the photographers wearing a draped black dress that had a 3-D ape worked into it? An ape drape. After that, it was a case of every nation under a smile—not just the little-girl performers, but the from-everywhere audience, too. Never in a nasty way, though, because apart from the missing-link showpiece, the collection represented some of Chalayan's most highly evolved designs for everyday living. Take the clothes away from the concept and you simply have intelligently cut asymmetrical dresses and all-in-ones with interesting gathers and soft drapes. Some came in prints of Stone Age flint ax heads, and others with straps made of special rough-cut Swarovski stones made to imitate, well, stones.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""4yzd9""></div></div><p>At the end, two girls came out in mechanical dresses that, in the darkness, sent out moving spots of light configured to symbolize the big-bang beginning of the universe. They were, as always in a good Chalayan show, astonishing and moving. But somehow, it was the sight of those normally dead-faced models coming to life that was really miraculous.</p></div>"
41,fall,2008,f2008,chanel,"A Chanel carousel fitted out with giant quilted bags, camellias, pearls, boaters, and bows faced the audience as it poured into the Grand Palais for the Fall Ready-to-wear show. It was a fitting metaphor for the timeless turning of the house classics, and for the unstoppable machine fashion has become these days. The instinct, on arrival, was to prepare to hold on tight. How fast would this thing be set to whiz? How many blur-speed notions would Karl Lagerfeld manage to whip past us this time?</p><p>Thankfully, instead of the past few seasons' bamboozling surges of styles, all that transpired was that the girls walked in a circle, then climbed aboard the turning merry-go-round so that the clothes could be viewed again at leisure. It was worth a second and third look because this was a collection that, in spite of its something-Chanel-for-everyone variety, also provided gimmick-free commentary on current trends. Lagerfeld didn¿t miss a trick, from fragile, frothy, high-necked blouses to spidery knits, peplum jackets, and an intelligent exploration of how longer lengths might be worked into a winter wardrobe. It could be as a tweed maxi column skirt with a delicate blouse (the literal version), but also as a long, cutaway ostrich-trimmed coat over a short skirt (newer and cooler). And what of austerity chic, the subject du jour? Lagerfeld's witty take was an updated retread of Coco Chanel's ""poverty de luxe,"" so that the tweed suits came with worn-through elbows or scatterings of faux-darned patches. Nothing too heavy, of course, because Lagerfeld is not one to take passing fashion issues, even recession, too seriously. But in its relative restraint, reserved color, and holding back on accessory overload, this collection was a smart way to prove that whatever goes around comes around, and ends up looking just as Chanel as ever.</p></div>"
42,fall,2008,f2008,charles-nolan,"""Oh, it's this whole Marie Antoinette thing,"" Charles Nolan said backstage. How exactly does a politically motivated Democrat, whose first love is American sportswear, take onboard the Queen of Fashion? He translates the pannier construction of the eighteenth century into a twenty-first-century weave of industrial mesh and taffeta, allowing the fabric to hold its shape. He counterbalances the court of Louis XVI with the court of Camelot, bringing back the Jackie Kennedy coats and neat suits of Spring and emboldening them with let-them-eat-cake details like flounced bows and gigot sleeves.</p><p>Nolan's Seventh Avenue-meets-Petit Trianon concept was best achieved in the first look: a sporty-haute taffeta trench over a ruffled top and skinny corduroys, with knee-high boots. When Versailles is your starting point, there are bound to be a few overly florid moments, but Nolan can be excused for his exuberance: He's just received a Fashion Group International award for his retail store; his company has a newish, deep-pocketed investor; and there's the promise of Clinton or Obama in the White House in '08.</p></div>"
43,fall,2008,f2008,chloe,"Chiffon for winter. It's undeniably a trend out there, but, in spite of climate change, still a bit of an odd one. Paulo Melim Andersson is one of its proponents, and in his case you can kind of see the logic—he's chasing what makes Chloé hot. When Karl Lagerfeld held the design reins here in the seventies, the label was famous for print-y chiffon blouses and dresses, and in its latter heyday, Phoebe Philo brought a lot of organza, eyelet, and embroidery to the party. Ergo, Chloé for Fall was a cross between the two.</p><p>What Melim Andersson turned out was essentially a show of blurry, microflower prints, and haberdashery appliqués and embroideries on organza aimed at a young girl (provided she has funds in the no-worries class: Chloé prices are well up there in the luxury league). The designer layered them up with flower-print tights, broderie anglaise leggings, and the odd piece of outerwear to keep out the drafts—a black coat with short sleeves and a bodice embellished with tufty fur, a seventies coyote jacket with embroidery, and a boxy Prince of Wales ""boyfriend"" coat.</p><p>There's no denying that Melim Andersson can do pretty things—say, an off-white trapeze sprinkled with silver stars worn over a floral blouse, or a wispy long-sleeved dress with a fluttery side trail—but still, it wasn't just the fabric that felt a bit thin in this show. In the Phoebe era, Chloé was, among other things, a go-to label for It trousers, a category Melim Andersson skipped over with a couple of pinstripe jog-pant hybrids. That's one element he could work at reconstituting in future collections. As things stood, it was left to the footwear to give a reminder of the zingy assemblage of items that are essential to the quirky Chloé knack: sexy-cool pointy stilettos with an ankle cuff, and booties with 3-D leaves climbing up the side.</p></div>"
44,fall,2008,f2008,chris-benz,"Chris Benz's Fall collection began to take shape on a trip to Paris with friend Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann, where the two sat in cafés, becoming enamored with the style of French women—older French women, that is. ""I love the idea of a funny old woman pulling wrinkled clothes from 50 years ago out of a suitcase,"" said Benz. ""I always like that weird girl."" She was certainly on display—sporting fur fezzes and zigzag Shetland knits, no less—at his presentation held in the literary environs of the Lotos Club, where the designer once again showed color-coordinated tableaux vivants.</p><p>Benz pronounced this collection both more tomboyish and more polished than previous outings. It was both those things—and stronger for them. Since he launched, the designer has learned to limit his quirkiness to smaller doses, while keeping his fearless and enviable sense of color intact. It's a treat to see Benz's vision in full bloom—a world where such precocious ensembles as a red, white, and blue checked suit over a pale lavender shirt and magenta oxfords seem logical. But this collection also had simple, strong pieces that could be pulled out to stand on their own, like a plain silk tapered T-shirt dress, and Benz's chic take on the comfort of a sweatshirt in a terrific and easy boxy, layered silk blouse.</p><p>Looks like these suggest that Benz is aware of and adjusting to a particular challenge he faces: He has created his own particular image, but while he's built up a healthy business thus far, marketing quirkiness isn't easy. Time will tell if the young designer can make his world one that everyone wants to be part of.</p></div>"
45,fall,2008,f2008,christian-dior,"Imagine Mrs. Robinson in <em>Valley of the Dolls</em>, and you more or less have the measure of Christian Dior for Fall: gigantic back-combed hairdos, equally gigantic eye makeup, and the neat ladylike suits and dresses beloved of Kennedy-era America. It was a trip around what John Galliano called the ""optimism and opulence"" of the sixties, amped up with bright color, lashings of paillette embroidery, and Western hats.</p><p>Decidedly, though, this was Galliano in general-service mode rather than personal fantasyland. Chop off the heads, as it were, and what was left was a wearable collection that will be legible to all women who crave a straight-up injection of high-octane glamour as an antidote to gloom. It involved boxy jackets worn with A-line skirts and detailed with standaway collars and covered buttons; luxe minks and chinchillas cut in horizontal bands; Dior houndstooth checks bound with black patent edgings; a few rounded-off, overlapping mid-century geometric prints; and bejeweled bubble dresses for evening. Nothing, then, either to scare (not even the shoes, which were stack-heeled and supernormal) or to set new agendas—but simply a demonstration of Galliano's increasing facility for running up money-spinning ready-to-wear calculated to read across continents.</p></div>"
46,fall,2008,f2008,christian-lacroix,"Poufs and prints, insane color, and wacky-chic accessories—these are the things that keep Lacroix fans faithful to his couture shows season after season. The question is always whether he'll manage to get something of that ineffable wonderment over in his ready-to-wear: In the past, there's sometimes been such a sense of dilution that the fizz goes missing. This time Lacroix pulled it off much better than in the last few seasons, adding delightfully idiosyncratic touches to a show that displayed some of his good old tricks in the way of bubbly shapes and cheerfully luxe color.</p><p>Take a cream cloque short-sleeved coat over a succulent gathered double-duchesse skirt, accessorized with a pair of black marabou armlets—who else would think of that? From there on, the show concentrated on embellished brocade funnel-neck coats, patchworked gold lamé and dévoré velvet drop-waisted shifts, and brushstroke-print strapless cocktail numbers. It ended with a series of draped, swagged, bow-bedecked single-color satin dresses in bright fuchsia, orange, pistachio, and lime. As is often the case with Lacroix, though, it's the one that got away that stays in the mind most: in this case, the single black one-shouldered corset dress with an asymmetric meringue of a skirt that could only have come from his hand. Pretty, amusing, and just a bit quirky, it captured the spirit of couture in a way that a young generation of customers just might love.</p></div>"
47,fall,2008,f2008,christopher-kane,"The declarations that were flying through the air after Christopher Kane's Fall show ranged from ""poetic"" (a dreamy young editor) to ""commercially sellable"" (a store buyer) to ""Virginia Woolf's <em>Orlando</em> meets John Everett Millais' <em>Ophelia</em> "" (from a newspaper headline hound). It opened with a charcoal cashmere poncho knit, wended its way through khaki Aran tabards, and built up into shivery plastic paillettes on organdy contrasted with stud-embellished cashmere sweaters.</p><p>In other words, no sound bite or literal theme adequately describes the way Kane's collection turned out this season. The manner in which he and his sister Tammy design is a kinetic process given to many changes. Witness: Two months ago he was thinking about the Queen, Barbara Cartland, and Big Bird. What they came up with, in essence, is a pretty contribution to party dressing involving veiled panels of sequins on dresses and a wispy suggestion of a longer hemline (transparencies were left to waft below the knee without constriction). Weirdly, if there's a criticism, it's in the fact that the frisson of vulgarity that was central to Kane's attraction in his first three seasons was somehow absent. On the other hand, maybe that's OK. At this point, Kane, like any young designer who wants to make it, needs something to sell without upsetting customers. And this Fall, the Glaswegian fashion prodigy may have put himself in a better position to survive.</p></div>"
48,fall,2008,f2008,collette-dinnigan,"It's the last day of Paris, and if people aren't preoccupied with plotting their exit strategies, they're tallying up the season's strongest shows and asking questions about what it all means. It's not a good day for the Aussie designer Collette Dinnigan to present her modest collection. There are simply too many reasons to overlook it, and Dinnigan's first job should be to address that issue before another season passes.</p><p>As for the show itself, it hewed close to the agenda she established in her last two seasons here: party clothes that straddle the sexy-sweet divide. In the sexy camp were a taffeta baby-doll dress with pleats and a strapless point d'esprit gown. On the sweet side were rock star-skinny leather leggings and stretch jersey pants worn with a one-shoulder top fully covered in crystals; a puff-shouldered, belted satin tunic; and a fitted jacket with metallic frogging on its front.</p><p>One little black dress with a sculptural bow above a bare, low-cut back stood out from all the rest. Dinnigan's second task should be to take that frock back to the studio and study it. A collection full of pieces as clever and cute could get her noticed here.</p></div>"
49,fall,2008,f2008,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo is an Amy Winehouse fan—who knew? The multiple Grammy award winner's <em>Back to Black</em> played solidly throughout the Comme des Garçons Fall show, and such was the funny sideways take on trashy fifties net petticoats, dance dresses, and underwear that fell out on the runway that—who knows?—maybe La Beehive will eventually return the compliment.</p><p>Seriously, though, this was Kawakubo in one of her more skittish moods. As she put it, ""There's value in bad taste, too. This is Comme des Garçons bad taste."" That included puffballs of tulle in red and cotton-candy pink, hairnet veils, leopard-spot hats, and lattices of elasticized satin-frilled garter straps connecting the gaps between chopped-up garments. Cheesy lip and heart motifs came into play as well, the mouths opening as suggestive frilled portholes on coats, and the love-hearts as embroideries. Still, despite Kawakubo's best efforts to confound the tyranny of ""good"" taste, she couldn't help but end up with a few items that might just look unironically pretty on the right girl. The black satin bra-topped velvet and chiffon negligee dress, the red circle-skirted polka-dot dance dress, and the white tulle ballet dress caged in black tape all cry out for an Amy, a Lily Allen, or even a dear Kelly Osbourne to do them justice.</p></div>"
50,fall,2008,f2008,costello-tagliapietra,"Hoping to showcase ""a different side"" of their talent, Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra dreamt up individual characters for each of their models, engaged the MisShapes to do the music, and, after deciding on the waist as the anchor of their silhouette, set about playing with sleeves and hem lengths.</p><p>The haunting fairy-tale illustrations of Arthur Rackham and Gustaf Tenggren were the creative kickoff point. Rackham's and Tenggren's long-locked nymphs, ""oddly enough,"" the designers said, ""lead us to forties film noir."" (Well, both genres are dark and moody, and they do both feature sylphlike damsels in distress.) The rigor of that decade's lines, already a touchstone this season, was a good match for Costello and Tagliapietra's draping skills, as evidenced by the slim cocktail dresses, especially a beautiful gathered teal one worn by Danielle Zinaich and a gray satin number with ""claw"" insets. They also included more silk (some sand-washed four times to give it a sueded hand) amid their signature jersey, and successfully added prints, notably a trompe l'oeil fur and a Rorschach floral.</p><p>It was when the well-liked duo went against their own grain and tried to go uncharacteristically casual that missteps were made. For instance, when a silky wrap was awkwardly layered over a turtleneck. Styling, in other words, is where they slightly lost the plot.</p></div>"
51,fall,2008,f2008,costume-national,"Ennio Capasa said this was the third part of a trilogy on ""the future""; it started with his Fall 2003 line and continued for Spring 2007. If memory serves, his space walks have never been as out there as those of his peers, and this season was no exception. The final frontier was really just a framework around which to build another collection of the sharp, angular tailoring he favors—now almost exclusively in black. It also gave him an excuse to add some aerodynamic ruffles and furls to cocktail dresses. As for that tailoring, it included coats with high, swooping collars out of <em>The Matrix</em>, strong-shouldered jackets, a cropped satin pant with a new wider leg, fit-and-flare tunics, and strict pencil skirts. A pastel turtleneck gave a sleeveless gray shift with a looped-up hem an air-stewardess touch circa 1960. But everything else—in particular, the little black dress with stiff ruffles spinning about the torso and around the model's neck that closed the show—was severe and sexy. Space is a place Capasa should visit more often.</p></div>"
52,fall,2008,f2008,cynthia-rowley,"It started with a bang: the backdrop, a giant book cover, falling open to unleash a three-dimensional illustration of a forest scene. (Rowley, a mother of two, is—at least according to a loud rumor—working on her first children's book.) Here and there, silhouettes of elephants and lions and the like were collaged, pop-up style, onto the clothes—to give the collection the kind of ""wink that a kids' book would have,"" the designer said. That trick was a bit, well, tricky, but there were lots of appealing shirtwaist dresses in dark plum and teal, with tucks and pleats and sheer hems, and oversized let's-play-dress-up outerwear, all worn with fur d'Orsay pumps to add to the fun.</p></div>"
53,fall,2008,f2008,d-g,"Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana can work a theme like nobody's business, and at their D&amp;G show they went mad for plaid, that cloth beloved of Her Majesty the Queen. There were an array of twinsets over calf-grazing kilts and long blazers topping full skirts in mismatched tartans, complete with checked tights, and—get this—silk handkerchiefs tied just below the chin. No royal wardrobe is complete without a mackintosh, of course, and the boys' version looked surprisingly fab, as did their take on the greatcoat.</p><p>Balmoral is uncharted territory for this duo, and a few of the fuller skirts will come off as dowdy on the post-teen set that is this collection's target crowd. But the designers made up for that with seventies-ish denim flares (the best jeans of the season so far), Mongolian lamb vests, and tunics belted over skinny pants that belled below the ankle, rendered in riotously colored paisley velvets. Trade in the flat velvet slippers that accompanied the closing parade of floor-sweeping plaid chiffon dresses for the golden-heeled patent-leather boots seen elsewhere in the collection, and you could picture these looks at Bungalow 8.</p></div>"
54,fall,2008,f2008,daks-by-giles-deacon,"Now in his third season at Daks, Giles Deacon has begun to tame his tendency to create the one-off showpiece (or a show full of them) and instead put together a more cohesive, complete collection. He started things off with leather outerwear, moving from a soft-shouldered olive trench to a brown cocoon coat with a gathered neck—both as smart as they were sensible. More sportif were a quilted jacket in safety orange and a black hooded stadium coat. The show's strongest toppers were trapeze-shaped and came in a substantial purple or iridescent gray tweed; he used the same fabric for a pencil skirt and a blouson jacket. Other skirtsuits—cropped and fitted jackets worn with the season's new calf-grazing, narrow skirt—came with neat little scarves tied at the neck, a reminder of this British label's proper past.</p><p>Where Deacon faltered was with the evening pieces. Maybe he'd used up all his good ideas in London, or at Fay, the American brand owned by the Tod's Group, for which he debuted a 25-piece capsule collection earlier this week? In any case, the Daks dresses—a lineup of loose, waistless silk numbers in gray or bright pink embellished at the bodice with matching paillettes—felt slack compared to his polished tailoring.</p></div>"
55,fall,2008,f2008,daryl-k,"""For me, it's about personal style,"" Daryl Kerrigan said at the highly informal in-studio showing of her Daryl K collection and her Kerrigan secondary line. ""People are going to dress the way they dress.""</p><p>It's true that Kerrigan herself has, even after her post-Pegasus comeback, always orbited around her East Village aesthetic. But, she said, although both labels undeniably have a downtown slant, she's trying to widen the divide between them. The casual Kerrigan line, shown on non-models found and cast by the designer on the street, is everything you'd expect it to be, with a plaid puffer and blue-gray washed-denim biker jacket with matching jeans. The Daryl K look, on the other hand, had a distinct polish and luxury: Beyond the obviously east-of-Avenue A intarsia knits with eighties squiggles and the Day-Glo mesh shirts, there were soft alpaca coats, a tomboyish gray wool suit, belted tunic dresses (with the lightest trim of flat studs), and an almost-formal gown with a raw hem and hanging braided straps. ""It's been inch by inch coming back,"" Kerrigan said. Consider this another inch onward and upward.</p></div>"
56,fall,2008,f2008,daughters,"Swaim and Christina Hutson of Obedient Sons have carved out a nice niche for themselves as purveyors of subversively conservative menswear in the fifties American prep-school vein—if you can imagine Holden Caulfield starting a punk band instead of brooding in his dorm room, you've got a good idea of the line's philosophic bent. The husband-and-wife team threw a few women's looks into the mix last season, an experiment that they've expanded for Fall '08, in recognition of which they've rechristened the line Obedient Sons and Daughters.</p><p>The Hutsons' daughters are mirroring their sons for now, with the tweedy outerwear, long john-style trousers, and brocade dinner jackets the duo made for the boys tweaked with higher waists and slightly more pronounced curves for the girls. It's a smart tactic. These designers have the preppy-rebel look down pat, and it's an aesthetic that appeals to a lot of women who want clothes that have the straightforward unfussiness of their boyfriends' and husbands' wardrobes. In fact, with their mussed hair and getting-away-with-it smiles, the girls in this show looked cooler than the boys.</p></div>"
57,fall,2008,f2008,dennis-basso,"Dennis Basso is celebrating his 25th anniversary as a furrier this year, so there was a celebratory feeling in the air at his show. Lorraine Bracco arrived bearing a congratulatory bouquet, and his loyal ladies came wearing his coats despite the afternoon rain. And, no surprise, there were plenty more lavish furs on the runway. The first look, a trapeze coat in creamy alligator on top and Russian sable below, was a good indication of the luxe factor on display. Yes, there were relatively simple and straightforward minks, but Basso much prefers to show off the technical innovations of his factories, not to mention the seemingly limitless imagination of his design room. A broadtail jacket, to name just one example, was spliced with handmade lace inserts and trimmed in silver fox.</p><p>Basso may have a quarter century of experience in the fur trade, but he has significantly less as a designer of ready-to-wear—which might be the explanation for an overwhelming trapeze dress that practically suffocated its model in marabou feathers, or for the ""techno"" appliqués on a pair of long dresses that looked like nothing so much as rave ware. But he made up for those with a trio of understated black gowns (one of them belted with a string of pearls) that his gals would be delighted to wear underneath their sables.</p></div>"
58,fall,2008,f2008,derek-lam,"""Controlled exuberance"" were Derek Lam's buzzwords backstage. Expanding on what inspired him, he cited Isak Dinesen and her lifelong struggle to resolve the contradictions between her family's bourgeois values and her own, more adventurous, spirit. That's a lot of meaning to load into a collection, but Lam gave it his best shot. The control was in the rigorous tailoring: a dramatic, sweeping duster coat; a sexy herringbone corset worn with a narrow gray tweed skirt; and a rethought three-piece suit, consisting of a trench, double-breasted riding jacket, and stovepipe trousers, all in a taupe wool tweed. As for the exuberance, it could be seen in a red and ivory floral chiné-print sack dress and in a black tulle sequined-and-feathered spaghetti-strap frock.</p><p>There were moments where Lam's two-sided equation really added up—a casually chic combination of a gold lace dress and a boxy brown leather jacket, for example. As a whole, though, the concept never quite jelled. Still, the show ended on a lovely note. Lam has always had a way with gowns, and this season was no exception. A pair of draped numbers, in midnight and black velvet with ivory pleated crinolines swishing at their hems, said soigné; the two silk gazar dresses gave us sculptural. Here, at least, the designer was fully in control.</p></div>"
59,fall,2008,f2008,derercuny,"What's missing from the modern woman's wardrobe? It's not the tunic dress, densely embroidered to evoke armor and featuring sheer, G-string-exposing, ruched tulle sides, that closed the Derercuny show. A blouse in black lace—also see-through, and with the puffed upper sleeves of a medieval knight's costume—probably isn't topping anybody's must-have list either. But there they both were in Korean designer Mina Lee's third runway show for this Samsung-backed, Milan-based brand. Once upon a time (as in before she started showing the collection on a catwalk), Lee was known for the deceptively simple, wearable way she mixed feminine details with masculine tailoring. There <em>were</em> practical and chic pieces here, including a blouson sweater vest that topped a high-neck button-down chiffon blouse and long khaki flares, as well as on-trend, thick-ribbed, short sweater dresses that looked dipped in gold or silver paint. But they were lost in the Gothic haze produced by the out-of-date notion of building a collection around an inspiration as overt as the Middle Ages.</p></div>"
60,fall,2008,f2008,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg channeled the forties in a show she dubbed ""Foreign Affair"" for the three cities her imaginary muse visits: first Berlin, then Shanghai, followed by Manhattan. Separates played a starring role in her story—a big departure from last season's dress-centric lineup, and a timely one, as sportswear, like the forties, is shaping up to be a big New York trend. The collection began with a bow-front blouse and a flaring A-line skirt or full-leg trousers; from there, von Furstenberg added a trim cardigan or a puff-sleeve jacket, and over that went a coat, sometimes oversize, always cinched with a narrow leather belt. Herringbone and glen plaid met a dove-gray floral print. Lurex gingham topped black feathers. And slinky silk slips peeked out from beneath chunky cardigans.</p><p>Woman cannot live on sportswear alone, though, and come evening, the options multiplied. A floral-print cheongsam and an old-Hollywood gold lamé gown stuck to the script DVF had laid out. But she appeared to lose the plot with a flapper's sack dress studded with beads and sequins. Then again, von Furstenberg's heroine, like the designer herself, plays by no rules but her own.</p></div>"
61,fall,2008,f2008,dkny,"""Eclectic Glamour,"" trumpeted the notes at DKNY, where the first showing was so shoulder-to-shoulder packed that you wondered if everyone but you knew that Madonna or Justin Timberlake was giving an impromptu concert. Nope, people were there for the clothes, and there was a lot to see—a colorful, tactile, thrown-together riot of tweed, brocade, Lurex jacquard, printed silk, corduroy, and a sheep farm's worth of knits: patterned intarsias, cozy hand-knits, and fringed dresses. You did just read the word ""eclectic,"" remember? The sixties were in full swing in the proliferation of baby-doll silhouettes, but it's a shape from seasons past that doesn't seem ready for revival just yet. Karan and her team tapped into the bohemian glamour of Biba in sweet peasant dresses, which, when removed from the busy whole, will be a sure hit—as will other pieces like a bouclé bomber jacket and several chunky sweaters. But in the end, the goal of eclecticism seemed to get the best of the situation, creating a cacophonous mix for a collection that usually rings clear with fresh energy.</p></div>"
62,fall,2008,f2008,dolce-gabbana,"Whatever else happens in Milan, you can count on Dolce &amp; Gabbana to put on the glossiest high-production, total-conviction, proper old-school show in town. This season, they hit on a device for merging the feeling for longer lengths with tailoring and ""country"" fabrications: the midi-skirt moment, circa early-seventies London. A remix of David Bowie's greatest hits was on the soundtrack as the girls pounded out in curly haired gilets, flat caps, poor-boy sweaters, country-check shirts, printed silk scarves, and dozens of tweedy skirts, gathered into the waist and hitting at mid-calf.</p><p>As a summary of trends that have been simmering since New York, it was polished and amusing—and if the girth-expanding potential of those skirts posed a worry, no matter. For one thing, Domenico Dolce, the child of a Sicilian tailor, has another excellent offer up his sleeve—the latest cut of the house pantsuit: neat, three-pieced, and skinny-legged. It looked good. And then there's the romance. That emerged onto the scene in fur-printed chiffon blouses, skirts, and puffer jackets, and ended up with the now-traditional set piece of the Dolce &amp; Gabbana crinoline parade. This time they were whipped out of a combination of pale chiffon and random overlayerings of fur and bolts of British tailoring fabric, a sort of funny <em>ta-da!</em> of all the themes, seasonal and personal, that the designers had managed to weave into the performance. As a whole, the show hit the right note for the times—toned down, but not depressing. And whether you'd actually buy into it or not, the sheer breadth of the repertoire Dolce &amp; Gabbana has made its own—jeans to leather jackets, suits to gowns and accessories—is a spectacle that deserves a cheery salute.</p></div>"
63,fall,2008,f2008,donna-karan,"The silk satin bathrobe dress with which Donna Karan opened her Fall show was something of a head-scratcher. This is the designer, after all, who helped women into the boardroom with her famous Seven Easy Pieces collection in the mid-eighties. Why had she now set her sights on the bedroom? Not that slinking around in a satin robe doesn't have its appeal, but what about practicality? Some of Karan's dresses came in jewel-tone chiffon that dipped dangerously close to the belly button in front, or went low on the sides and gathered loosely at the waist before gently falling to the knees. Others were draped toga-style in jersey, with elaborately knotted crisscrossing straps in back. Many of them had a lovely languid quality, but forget about wearing a bra.</p><p>Happily, those looks were just one side of Karan's story for Fall. Structured tailoring was the other, and this was represented by suits that, though they were more than office-ready, didn't ignore the female form. Case in point: a rose cashmere tweed cardigan jacket and wrap skirt with gentle curves. Coats, likewise, had an appealing roundness to them. Not the ""falling leaves"" ribboned silk shag number, though—no woman wants to look <em>that</em> round. But both a black-and-silver cashmere brocade coat with a blanket collar and an antiqued leather jacket looked effortlessly cool, though they were from opposite ends of the dressed-up/dressed-down spectrum. Those are the kinds of pieces that will really move once they hit stores.</p></div>"
64,fall,2008,f2008,doo-ri,"Doo-Ri Chung is almost ready to shed her ""jersey girl"" ID. There wasn't a fluid knit dress in the lineup, although the fabric the designer focused on was, in fact, a bonded jersey, or two pieces of fabric fused together. ""It's much more sculptural,"" she said backstage, explaining that she was also interested in graphic textures, specifically exotic skins. The show opened with a series of chic little black dresses made from that sculptural material—in pod, hourglass, or bell silhouettes—which were embroidered or spliced with curving shapes that accentuated the models' forms. It closed with a few more short cocktail dresses that mined similar territory. One organza shift was appliquéd with scores of concentric ovals of chiffon, with results that evoked scales. Another was stitched with tiny Swarovski crystals to the same effect.</p><p>In between came a diverse group of looks that showed off Doo.Ri's expanding range. A charcoal blouse, a quilted chiffon vest, and a sexy, slim pant demonstrated Chung's tailoring chops. The designer also introduced a lot of knits, the most desirable being a tank top-and-shrug twinset in cashmere. Another sign that Chung is moving on, and up: She designed all of the accessories herself—shoes, hats, gloves, and jewelry.</p></div>"
65,fall,2008,f2008,douglas-hannant,"""Douglas always has something for everyone,"" said socialite CeCe Cord before Hannant's show in the velvet-curtained environs of the Hudson Theatre. Cord was joined by Becca Cason Thrash, Jamee Gregory, Debbie Bancroft, and other loyalists who braved sideways rain to attend. Chances are, they each found something to make the trip worthwhile in this point-counterpoint collection. Hannant punctuated lean, body-skimming dresses for both day and evening with doses of volume in Poiret-esque cocoon coats and poet sleeves. His exploration of tactile fabrics—nubby bouclés, feathers, glazed lace—was tempered by unembellished charmeuses and plain wools. And amid the ultra-feminine parade was a natty three-piece suit in a Prince of Wales wool—albeit a wool shot with silver thread. This designer knows his lady likes to sparkle—even when channeling Annie Hall.</p></div>"
66,fall,2008,f2008,dries-van-noten,"The good thing about fashion now is that it's so broad and inclusive of self-expression that even when one edge is pushing at austerity chic, there are many other takes that are equally valid. One of them is Dries Van Noten's. On his runway, the argument for multi-printed, many-textured dressing is upheld with such grace he almost makes it look easy. It goes without saying that Van Noten has been the go-to designer for lovers of arty-ethnic textiles and undemanding shapes for years, but now something more interesting is happening. Lately, his collections have shaken off the feeling of being a specialist refuge for anti-mainstream devotees. What Van Noten is showing—more streamlined shapes, longer lengths, loopy knits, furs, high heels—is a reflection of what he calls ""dressing 'up,' but in a modern way.""</p><p>But back to those prints. Van Noten moved into marbleized printing techniques that added a beautiful distortion to traditional paisleys, and he replaced last season's giant painterly blooms with micro-flowers. These appeared on slim chiffon mid-calf sheaths, tunics, and at the end, two amazing floor-length fan-pleated dresses. Still, it was the things he did with solid color and knits that actually made the collection gel: blue-dyed fox chubbies, layered raw-edged chiffon dresses in mauve or dusty pink, and a couple of holey-stitch sweaters that happen to look perfectly in sync with the current avant-garde edge of fashion. Put together with multi-strapped, multicolored high-heeled sandals, the impression of grace in movement became poetically compelling. Even though there was, ultimately, a nod toward the ethnic embroidered vest and dress beloved by classic Dries customers, the success of this show was that it presented a shopping list that many more kinds of women might want to dip into for winter.</p></div>"
67,fall,2008,f2008,dsquared,"This season, the Dsquared² girl is a secretary, or maybe a librarian, with a seriously wild streak. By day, she wears a little cardigan tossed over a belted turtleneck and pencil skirt, a camel coat with a fur collar, or, when she's feeling bold, a tartan skirtsuit with pleats at the back of a nip-waisted jacket. But after dark, it's a different story. She spends most nights at her lover's place, in lingerie: black silk camis under fitted blazers, or a bustier dress with silver spikes. Sometimes the lingerie stays on for the morning dash back to her place. The show's last look wasn't a big gown, but a nude and black teddy that the model coquettishly hid from view behind a fur chubby on her proverbial walk of shame.</p><p>As lascivious as that sounds, this was a fairly buttoned-up show for the theatrics-loving Caten brothers. It featured some of the outerwear they do so well—including a tweedy pod coat with a fur collar and a sportier take on the same shape with a gold zip closure. Too bad these were almost obscured amid the flesh-tone fishnets and platform pumps with lightning-bolt heels (which several of the girls had a curiously difficult time keeping on their feet). That the Catens should be such unreformed party boys but excel at chic practicality is an irony appreciated by a growing number of observers, but it still seems lost on them.</p></div>"
68,fall,2008,f2008,duro-olowu,"In three short seasons of showing on the London runway, Duro Olowu's command of a vibrant form of personal chic has grown to such a degree, you'd scarcely believe this is a designer who operates out of Portobello Road. His Fall collection was such a confident mix of multi-patterned couture, African batik print, and sophisticated styling that it evoked something of Yves Saint Laurent's gift for magicking wildly improbable color combinations into the epitome of easy-to-wear elegance. ""Lush color and superluxury for winter,"" he called it, adding, ""Really, it's about inner beauty and personal style."" Olowu used vivid camouflage prints in several different colorways for tailored jackets and pants, chintzy roses for coats, and multicolored lamés on sloppy kimono coats; he also showed drop-waisted shifts and a newly sophisticated Empire-line interpretation of his signature patchwork dresses. There was a stately grace about his long, tiered peasant skirts, topped with either a crimson long-line cardigan or a taffeta riding jacket. It's a long way from that single breezy boho dress that launched his career, but in his focus on a grown-up customer who wants to stand apart in a sea of recessionary sobriety, Olowu offered an intelligent reading of the current mood.</p></div>"
69,fall,2008,f2008,eley-kishimoto,"Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto are staging a bit of a comeback this season—in addition to showing their signature line on the London runway, they're preparing to present their first collection for Cacharel in Paris. Building on their 1992 beginnings as artsy-crafty mom-and-pop printmakers (Japanese kawaii meets Welsh eccentric), they've created a brand that includes shoes, bags, and hosiery. True to past form, they turned out cute dresses with frills and Peter Pan collars in a range of harlequin and rabbit prints, needle-cord skirtsuits, and a couple of on-trend shaggy knit bombers. No surprises there; perhaps they're saving their powder for the far bigger challenge of impressing in Paris.</p></div>"
70,fall,2008,f2008,elie-saab,"Elie Saab's bread-and-butter is red-carpet clothes. But watching his show didn't conjure the glamour of celebrity so much as it did the tyranny of celebrity magazines, the trashy must-reads in which the stars' wardrobe choices are more often lambasted than cheered. Why? Because, in a risk-averse collection, the personality had been all but removed from the majority of Saab's gowns. Or maybe it was the sheer variety that numbed.</p><p>Inspired, his program notes said, by Mondrian's canvases, the designer cut his evening dresses in bright primaries like kelly green, deep red, and sky blue, along with black, and in styles that ranged from a strapless, narrow sequined sparkler to an entirely unrelated lawn gown that billowed in soft layers below the bust. In between, there were taffeta-and-velvet combos, lace, and countless bows.</p><p>Fewer in number were the chiffon dresses in multicolor Mondrian prints (the best a tiered halter that tied saucily in a long bow at the neck) and a pair of black-and-white De Stijl-influenced columns. Graphic and bold, they didn't play it safe like the others. Which means the gossip rags won't like them, but we did.</p></div>"
71,fall,2008,f2008,elie-tahari,"The chunky knit sweater is the new jacket at Elie Tahari this Fall, where it's paired with long, fuller trousers and cinched at the waist, creating a chic, urban silhouette. Menswear looks play off more feminine ones throughout this tightly edited collection, whose standouts include a rabbit-and-fox vest that would look good thrown on with one of the long slim skirts with sinuous curved seams; a fitted, invitingly soft leather jacket with ruffle details; and a purple jersey party dress that would undoubtedly meet with Prince's approval.</p></div>"
72,fall,2008,f2008,emanuel-ungaro,"Esteban Cortazar is the fourth heir to take the throne since Emanuel Ungaro retired from ready-to-wear in 2001. After a season in which the troubled house didn't mount a show, the 23-year-old replaces Peter Dundas, a designer who has at least 15 years' experience, as well as stints at Cavalli, Gaultier, and Lacroix to his credit. By comparison, Cortazar is relatively untested. He touts himself as the youngest designer ever to have shown at New York fashion week, but in the five-plus years since his debut he hasn't attracted the same level of attention that other up-and-comers of his generation have. To say that the young man has his work cut out for him is an understatement. The fact that he knows it—he sent a save-the-date card bearing the words ""Pressure, What Pressure!!""—is, unfortunately for him, no guarantee of success.</p><p>That's the backstory. As for Cortazar's first go at Ungaro, it had an altogether softer feel than what the label was famous for in the go-go eighties. In a nod to Mr. Ungaro's legendary love of color, there were, among the neutrals and pale pastels, a couple of hot-pink pieces, including a fitted sweater dress with an oversize ropey neckline that became one of the collection's motifs. Cortazar wove in a few prints, too. A rose-and-thorns pattern was more true to the house than the beach-rock photo print, but neither was as pretty as a grayish wood-grain silk chiffon that he draped and swagged into a standout gown.</p><p>Soft draping was the focus, be it a one-shoulder silk blouse and jersey skirt, a goddess gown, or a slouchy hoodie worn over a ruffle-neck dress. It was all done more quietly than in the founder's day, but, to Cortazar's credit, the hushed mood was in keeping with the season. Is he the right man for the job? His audience, as well as Ungaro's owners, has been notoriously impatient. But when he ran out for a bow and swiped his brow in mock relief, you couldn't help but root for him.</p></div>"
73,fall,2008,f2008,emilio-pucci,"There wasn't any falling snow—a point in Matthew Williamson's favor in a Milan season where runway precipitation has become a mini-trend—but it didn't take long to figure out that we were in Gstaad or St. Moritz. From the first look out, an egg-shaped coat, the designer established an icy pastel palette mixed with graphic white and black. The silhouettes were likewise well suited for the slopes (fur-lined parkas, shapely puffer jackets, ski-pant skinny leggings) or the rink (a slender turtleneck and tulip miniskirt). And to complete the picture, there were looks for lounging fireside in a suite at the Kulm Hotel. The furs came in several varieties: brightly colored patent shearlings in sporty shapes and glamorous dyed fox in more-is-more proportions.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Pucci show without a passel of print dresses. Today they ran the gamut, from sacks and shifts in jagged icicle patterns to flowy gowns in pleated chiffon. Not all of it worked; long jersey dresses, for instance, looked clunky atop the models' patent lace-up boots. But after five seasons, Williamson has hit on the formula: resort dressing for the rich and fabulous.</p></div>"
74,fall,2008,f2008,emporio-armani,"Giorgio Armani opened his Emporio show with a nip-waisted, flaring velvet coat that had a zipper descending diagonally from one shoulder to the opposite hip. It's a silhouette that's become familiar these last few seasons chez Armani, but he quickly segued into the ""relaxed approach"" and ""masculine aplomb"" his show notes promised, and in what felt like a return of sorts to his roots, he sent out a battalion's worth of pants. Double-pleated and cuffed in techno-utility fabrics or fuller through the thighs and tapering to the ankles in velvet, they were paired with jackets in oversize checks, stamped crocodile, chalk stripes, metallic leather, and more. The variety of fabrics notwithstanding, nearly all of those jackets were cut close to the body and fitted through the waist, and in keeping with the show's tailored turn, the hats, bags, and jewelry that accessorized every look were often spare and geometric in feeling. Even the casting was focused on models with short, angular haircuts.</p><p>That's not to say Armani neglected feminine sparkle—his repertoire, to say nothing of his retail footprint, is too wide-ranging for that. The crystal- and mirror-encrusted dresses that closed the show should appeal to the customer who insists on always dressing like a lady. But in a season when everyone is talking about the return of sportswear separates, it was good to see the designer largely playing to his first strength.</p></div>"
75,fall,2008,f2008,erdem,"""I went to town this season,"" said Erdem Moralioglu backstage after his show. ""From the beginning, I decided to just go all the way with what I love."" Throwing off mental and even commercial constraints is a brave thing to do in a darkening economic moment, but the intense flare-up of color, embroidery, and bejeweling this designer laid on may be the very thing that confirms his future.</p><p>Why so? For the first time, he marshaled a collection that was completely together, stamped with distinct and confident personality—a love of whimsy in a young but couture-ish idiom—and underpinned by attentively serviced sponsorship deals. He'd talked Taroni silks into providing lushly colored lengths of double duchesse, and he'd worked on lime, purple, acid yellow, and orange prints that ""looked blurry, like a landscape speeding past when you're on a train."" The fabrics turned into short dresses with dance skirts, covered-up cocktail suits with flat bows detailing stand-up necklines and belts, and dramatic strapless gowns—pieces made all the more outstanding with over-embroidery and padding (hand-done by Jenny King, a friend in Brighton), and scattered chunks of asymmetric gumdrop-colored Swarovski crystals.</p><p>Worked in, too, was cream lace from the French manufacturer Sophie Halette (a long-standing relationship) and raincoats representing Erdem's continuing consultancy with Mackintosh (trenchcoats <em>with</em> lace in two cases). It made for a dramatic show of integrated ideas that left the audience with the memorable final image of a funnel-collared gown, smothered with jeweled embroidery in the bodice, dropping to the floor in a gorgeous length of purple moiré silk. Bravo.</p></div>"
76,fall,2008,f2008,erin-fetherston,"Erin Fetherston's first look—a long black felted-wool overcoat, worn over a black chiffon floor-length gown, complete with rosary and hand-knit bonnet—suggested that the guru of girly was going goth. That, or she'd made a study of Mary-Kate Olsen's closet. But it was just a tease. After last season's more elegant outing, Fetherston chose to reprise many of the youthful shapes and silhouettes that first got her noticed. There were a few new, good-looking peacoats; a charming metallic-shot tweedy cape; and a coat-dress in a navy and black brocade. But what followed was a parade of familiar drop-waist frocks, bell-skirted dresses, and Empire princess looks, many of which were worn with opaque tights and ballerina slippers that accentuated the innocence factor. A tank dress that was short in the front and long in back was the freshest of the bunch, not only because it was so different from the rest, but also because of its vivid, almost hyper-real floral print.</p><p>Already this season, much has been said about the end of girly and the return of grown up. This wasn't a step backward necessarily, but Fetherston will have to push herself further next season if she wants to keep up with fashion's changing winds.</p></div>"
77,fall,2008,f2008,etro,"The program notes promised ""Romantic Wilderness,"" which apparently referred to the snowy woodland set at one end of the runway. From the opening exit, though, it was more a case of a steep plunge into the stylistic wilderness, a surreal place where Etro's potentially lovely paisleys and prints became hopelessly embroiled with fetishistic lace-up platform thigh boots and were inexplicably topped off with velvet air-stewardess hats.</p><p>Was there something Russian going on here? That could have accounted for the Sonja Henie-like skating skirts and the vaguely Chekhovian Victoriana suitings, with the lower half cut off at thigh level. Did anything escape the debacle? Some good shearling jackets, a shaggy black and white goat-hair coat, and a couple of long, streakily printed chiffon dresses. Otherwise, though, this show was an unfortunate setback for a house whose heritage deserves to be enhanced and celebrated in a much more appropriate way.</p></div>"
78,fall,2008,f2008,fendi,"When Karl Lagerfeld began designing for Fendi—that would be 1965—there were no other furriers (at least in Italy) who had the ambition to put fur at the forefront of fashion innovation. So much has gone around since then that it's almost unimaginable—fur has been ""in"" and ""out,"" markets have surged and crashed, and now we find ourselves in the unprecedented position where there's another economic wobble at exactly the same time that practically every fashion label is showing fur coats, gilets, chubbies, bags, you name it. The upshot is that it takes some oomph to keep Fendi in pole position, not just regarding ready-to-wear, but in streaking ahead with the extra extras in the furs, pushing the luxury to points that are out of reach of the common manufacturer.</p><p>This season, Lagerfeld kept the baseline of the clothing short, with a lot of action going on around the upper body: caped coats, poufed sleeves, high Elizabethan-influenced collars, and something of an autumn-woodland theme popping up, by the by. That's kind of enough to keep the clothes warm, but the real heat now has to be generated by the fur. So how about gilding it in 24-karat gold? Just about everyone is using fox these days, but when it appeared on the Fendi runway it turned heads—the tips of its hairs seemed to be illuminated with a golden glow. How's it done? Legendarily, Fendi has the handcraft no one else can muster, and now they've co-opted twenty-first-century science, using a secret process in which the fur is put into a molecular chamber that deposits gold particles onto the pelt while allowing it to remain silky. As it turned out, all the mink, fox, and astrakhan in the show that had a gold hue was treated with this technology, which, depending on the length of time spent in the chamber, gives the effect of an aura of light through to a thorough drenching. Fendi has tied up an exclusive on this—just as the price of gold is skyrocketing. All to the good of company prospects, of course: When a superrich lady comes to place her fashion investments, she'll be wanting something of proven exceptional value. Just watch the oligarchs flock.</p></div>"
79,fall,2008,f2008,salvatore-ferragamo,"Cristina Ortiz is doubtless under a great deal of pressure as the new creative director of Salvatore Ferragamo, where she replaces Graeme Black, who left the brand to focus on his signature label. The strain showed today. Ortiz was way off the mark with a brash collection of chain-mail minidresses, silk satin halterneck jumpsuits, spiraling coats and jackets spliced together with what looked like silver sutures, and cutaway gowns suspended from the shoulders with cobwebby threads—all of which came out on Lucite wedge heels with clear plastic toe straps. The Las Vegas vibe—one unlucky model walked the length of the runway in an ill-fitting halter top that left her breasts exposed—felt out of sync not only with the season but also with the company's heritage as a maker of traditionally elegant shoes and accessories.</p><p>Ferragamo celebrates its 80th anniversary this year, beginning with a grand fête in Shanghai next month that is scheduled to include a restaging of the Fall collection. There's still time to rejigger the mix by focusing on the pieces that did work here: a softly constructed bronze leather trench; a circular-cut suit jacket with rounded lapels shown with high-waisted, wide-legged pants; and a cape made from alternating stripes of black and silver sequins. Those looks could put the class back in classic.</p></div>"
80,fall,2008,f2008,francesco-scognamiglio,"If you looked past the fetish-y, rhinestone-studded, cream-colored latex, there was plenty to admire in Milan up-and-comer Francesco Scognamiglio's show. Nodding in the direction of Yves Saint Laurent's late-sixties/early-seventies heyday and displaying a deft hand for couturelike cuts, Scognamiglio sent out bell-shaped coat-dresses in stiff gold brocade or boiled wool; slim-line suits in black or ivory with puffed shoulders and flaring, deeply cuffed legs; and silky blouses with exuberant bows spilling down their fronts. More up-to-date were his silk or nylon puffer jackets, especially the ones lined in fox. When it came to after-dark, an ankle-grazing, lavender silk shantung dress with a spray of crystals decorating the asymmetric shoulder line was almost regal, while a short and strapless number in the same material was primed for the nightclub dance floor. If forced to choose between the demure and the louche, Scognamiglio would seem to lean toward the latter—the clue was not only in that latex but also in the thigh-high crocodile boots. These were a less obvious, but still kinky, touch that kept the collection from looking like a nostalgia trip, and more like a sexy bit of fun.</p></div>"
81,fall,2008,f2008,gareth-pugh,"Sometime during the genesis of Gareth Pugh's latest collection, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> bumped into <em>Predator</em>. The result was the kind of showy fashion farrago that has been a London staple since…oh, at least since Stonehenge was built. Coco Rocha marched out in a samurai dress made from zippers, and we were off. The zipper peplum, the zipper panniers, and the huge zipper shoulder pads were exploded components of what might almost have been a Joan Crawford costume, if she'd ever gotten to play the Predator Queen of Outer Space. Those famously exaggerated Crawford shoulders could also be inferred from a hooded gray flannel cape, or in-furred from the huge, shaggy goat-hair ""epaulets"" on a wrapped coat.</p><p>Pugh set out to make his models look like warrior women, emphasizing shoulders throughout with, first, the zips, then the flannel, the goat hair, and finally, polyhedra in leather or PVC. What that all pointed to was the weirdly Hollywood-ish glamour of the collection, recasting familiar items with diva-esque excess, hard edges, and a little wit: a tunic dress made entirely from safety pins, for instance; or a white coat-dress with a bolero back, also trimmed in safety pins; or almost any of the pieces that found creative things to do with all that goat hair. The fact that many of the shapes were surprisingly basic under the decorative add-ons (a quilted wind coat or a voluminous parka made up of polyhedra looked positively commercial) only made it clearer that Pugh is the latest in an illustrious line of British designers for whom the show's the thing. The partisan crowd shrieked with glee. When Pugh played Gary Glitter's chant, ""D'you wanna be in my gang?"" at the finale, there was no question about it.</p></div>"
82,fall,2008,f2008,giambattista-valli,"The references were spelled out on a board backstage: Ingmar Bergman's <em>Cries and Whispers</em>, the surrealist artist Meret Oppenheim, and ""Little Red Riding Hood."" You couldn't blame the busy Valli for needing to be reminded. His first collection for the outerwear company Moncler was scheduled to debut less than 24 hours after his signature show, and then there was also his just-launched fur line with Ciwifurs.</p><p>""It's the classic story of a bloodless woman that ends in the passion,"" Valli said, elaborating on his theme. That would explain the show's color palette, which slowly shifted from ivory to shocking pink to blood red, with a couple of prints along the way. The silhouette was a long exposé on volume, opening with a hobble skirt below one of his new fur shrugs, moving through the sway-back cocoon dresses that have become his signature, and finally exploding in a finale of ball gowns with fitted, strapless bodices atop enormous ballooning skirts. Embellishments ranged from pretty ruffles and fabric worked into rosettes to grandiloquent puckered-crepe necklines and lumps and bumps à la Rei Kawakubo.</p><p>Even the Mary-Kate Olsens of the world (she sat front-row today) don't make enough red-carpet appearances for all of the statement-making clothes Valli showed. Mundanities like sweaters, pants, trenchcoats, and other building blocks of a Fall wardrobe are certainly part of his oeuvre, but he neglected to put them on the runway. So while the story he told was engaging, if only for its sheer audacity, it wasn't the full picture. He's capable of doing more with less.</p></div>"
83,fall,2008,f2008,gianfranco-ferre,"Lars Nilsson has come and gone at the house of Gianfranco Ferré since the Spring show in September. The Swedish designer, it seems, didn't see eye-to-eye with the design team put in place and trained by Ferré himself before he passed away last summer. It was that team who stepped in earlier this month, after Nilsson's Fall designs were scrapped, to, as the company put it, create a new collection using ""the codes"" established by Ferré over the course of his long career.</p><p>Much more than the Spring show had, this felt like a paean to the late designer, not least because his original sketches were projected onto the back of the runway. The girls wore a succession of familiar Ferré signatures, like demonstrative white shirts with sweeping collars, and dresses with architectural flourishes—geometric ruffles at the shoulder blades or a bodice pleated like a fan. Ferré's meticulous tailoring was literally turned inside out, so that the inner workings of a dress were exposed. Stylist Lori Goldstein, with whom Ferré once collaborated on advertising campaigns, was brought in to put it all together, but despite everyone's efforts, it never really jelled. Group projects of this kind rarely do. Until the house hires a new creative director, as it has said it intends to do, it won't move forward.</p></div>"
84,fall,2008,f2008,giles-deacon,"When the press blunders backstage in search of the key to Giles Deacon's collections, he usually comes up with a surprise. This season it was a horror movie: <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em>, an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's story of ""people partying in a castle with everyone dying outside."" Or, as Deacon also paraphrased it: ""Femme fatale in a gothic disco!""</p><p>In retrospect, that did make a little more sense of the red dresses, the heads tied up in black veils, the spidery gothic sweaters knitted from yarn as fine as embroidery silk, and the billowy Hammer-horror hooded cape or two. By the sound of it, this might have been a collection that trod into Alexander McQueen's macabre storytelling territory, but no. Deacon never uses his clothes to support a narrative from beginning to end, or to suggest anything very subversive. In the end, attempting to join the dots between a series of couture puffas in duchesse satin, padded fin-de-siècle prints, a bone-colored leather dress, and a suede column with ""millipede"" fringe running down the front is a pointless exercise. What Deacon does, at best, is one-off special dresses with a lot of individualistic handcraft going on in them—clothes that happen to have a photogenic quality that reads well both on magazine pages and on the red carpet. Coherent on the runway or not, there are plenty of pieces in this collection that will meet that criterion just fine.</p></div>"
85,fall,2008,f2008,giorgio-armani,"Yesterday's Emporio show had the designer exploring his sporty side. But after opening somewhat perplexingly with a male model in a velvet suit, his Giorgio Armani collection today launched off in a different direction entirely—one that felt unapologetically feminine. ""Free-spirited,"" he called it in his program notes. In place of those boyishly practical cuffed trousers were soft velvet pants worn with blouses made from crisscrossing swags of pleated ruffles. And instead of office-ready menswear patterns, he played with flowers, printing them on his new longer skirts, knitting them extravagantly into the lining of a fur jacket, and arranging them across the hem of a sheer tulle top.</p><p>He really poured it on at night, tossing cobwebby scarves and wraps over nearly every one of his fringed gypsy dresses, and closing the show with a pair of dresses that looked like they were embroidered with thousands of colorful, glistening candy wrappers. He definitely got a bit carried away sometimes, but when he dialed back the details a notch or two, he sent out many desirable clothes, including a long cardigan coat in black and a grand cape that could've been a nod to the Costume Institute's <em>Superheroes: Fashion and Fantasy</em> exhibit he's sponsoring in May.</p></div>"
86,fall,2008,f2008,givenchy,"Finally, Riccardo Tisci got up on a runway and did what legions of frustrated editors have been willing him to do for ages: present a collection that put his talent properly and clearly on display for the first time. Not that buyers are disbelievers, or that women haven't run into Tisci's exceptional crisp blouses, sharp jackets, and subtly cut dresses in stores and been pleasantly shocked to find the label inside reads ""Givenchy."" It's just that until now, something—perhaps trying too hard for concept or atmosphere—has always scuppered the appeal on the catwalk.</p><p>This season, Tisci got it all under control, and at just the moment to take advantage of the fact that fashion is turning in the direction of his kind of dark, romantic, faintly goth aesthetic. Those on the hunt for new tailoring—something beyond a predictable blazer—will salivate over his black pantsuits and cropped toreador jackets, and the way he showed them with a hugely wantable variety of frothy blouses, from crisp white cottons to fragile, frilled plissé chiffons. Not to mention the slick black patent wedge boots with their tab-and-Velcro fastenings. Or the singular shiny leather puffer that made urban utility look chic again.</p><p>""I've been traveling in South America, and I discovered a romantic sensuality and elegance there I really identified with as a Catholic,"" said Tisci by way of explanation. The Hispanic influence became more obvious in the black lace and flamenco/matador touches later in the show, but (huge relief) the sense of modernity didn't end up sacrificed on the altar of theme. Where Tisci did ruffles and folkloric wool lace, it was often (and best) in chopped-up abstract appliqués on jackets and coats. Give or take a gold leather bubble dress and a slightly dubious revival of stretch pants, this collection finally shifted Tisci out of the ""promising"" category into a place where he deserves to be seen as a designer who has come of age.</p></div>"
87,fall,2008,f2008,gucci,"If you had to brainstorm the quintessential formula for Gucci-ness—the sexy, show-offy core of the brand's proposition— you'd probably come up with something like ""rock chick deluxe."" Frida Giannini got that feeling across for Fall by staging a raid on the Russian/Cossack/folklore department of the hippie wardrobe—the kind of printy, shaggy, peasanty things London groupies picked up at Portobello market in the early seventies, but scrubbed up to match today's luxury values, of course.</p><p>The potential banality of that starting point was parlayed— through multiple accessories, detailed handwork, and a lot of fur—into a collection that ranks as one of Giannini's most confident so far. She began with a billowy-sleeved embroidered peasant blouse over a pair of gold chain-swathed hipsters, thrust into flat riding boots reminiscent of the louche heyday of Rudolf Nureyev. From there, the show swung into tapestry coats, short chiffon print dresses with flippy skirts, and a plethora of cropped ribbon and stud-embellished vests and coats in shearling and Mongolian lamb. All this was rife with references to hussars and the folk textiles of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and it was finished with gold-chain bracelets, heart-shaped neckpieces, flying leather fringes on hobo shoulder bags, and the new ""Babushka"" carpet bag.</p><p>As a whole, the show didn't engage in any of the current dialogues (or are they anxiety attacks?) about where fashion is going. Perhaps, though, that's a kind of strength in itself. On the pragmatic side, this richly layered collection will separate out into dozens of affordable items. And on the other, there are a whole series of exceptional pieces, like the short lynx jacket and the tiered, feathery fox, whose appeal to the recession-proof superrich of the world could lie in the very fact that they don't fit in with any general trend. It'll be no surprise if many customers turn out to be Russian themselves.</p></div>"
88,fall,2008,f2008,haider-ackermann,"Tracking Haider Ackermann's progress, you get the impression that fashion could move from giddy florals to strict tailoring and back again and he'd still be doing the wafty draping and layering he's known for. In that regard, he's a lot like Rick Owens, whose work Ackermann sometimes echoes. This time around, the designer named birds and monasteries as his unlikely inspirations. You could see suggestions of the former in the ostrich plumes that peeked from the collars and lapels of side-fastening wrap jackets and coats, as well as in the parachute-silk hoods and tails left exposed by snug little leather bombers. The monastery part came across in the silk robes, although there was nothing monkish about a sexy black number that twisted at the ribs.</p><p>Ackermann's problems started below the waist. He said he wanted a very long line, but the way he layered soft, slouchy sweats or other more structured pants above leggings, and then bunched them up above the knee, created a droopy-drawers effect, even on the lankiest of his models. And besides, does anybody want to work that hard getting dressed in the morning? Much more appealing were those jackets, and a key densely draped turtleneck dress.</p></div>"
89,fall,2008,f2008,halston,"There's been just a bit of buzz about the Halston relaunch. How could there not be, when the king of Hollywood heat, Harvey Weinstein, is the man behind the project, and Tamara Mellon and Rachel Zoe are both at his side? The label's new creative director, Marco Zanini (Donatella Versace’s longtime first designer), is understandably no match for those outsize personalities, but it's his clothes that have to do the talking, and their moment finally came this afternoon at the Gagosian Gallery.</p><p>Halston’s oeuvre is of course well-known, and Zanini showed it a healthy amount of respect, launching straight into such signatures as the shirtdress and easy separates like boot-cut pants and long skirts with a soft swing, as well as tent dresses that he showed in cashmere, silk, and jersey. Zanini had also studied the late designer’s color palette—the dusty pastels were all there.</p><p>The newcomer already has one true believer: Liza Minnelli—in a vintage Halston pantsuit, naturally—let out an enthusiastic whoop at the first look, a lush knit cape in slate gray over a matching knit dress and suede knee-high boots. But overall, the collection left you wanting more. More of Halston’s double-face cashmere coats, yes, but also more of a sense of how Zanini will take the label forward. The unstructured evening gowns he showed today won’t cut it.</p></div>"
90,fall,2008,f2008,hermes,"The decor at Hermès can usually tell you something about the show's theme. Last Spring's wall of spices presaged the <em>Passage to India</em> clothes. This season's Oriental rug indicated Jean Paul Gaultier might be planning for another trip east. But, no.</p><p>This was the designer in atypical quiet mode. You could discern a mildly amusing furniture motif if you looked hard enough: The runway rug was reinterpreted as a pattern for skirts, robe dresses, knee-high boots, and decidedly un-Hermès jumpsuits tied off with tasseled silk cord belts. Fringed cashmere throw blankets, meanwhile, morphed into wrap skirts.</p><p>But for the most part, this was a collection of coats and jackets: pebble-leather trenches, suede-crocodile blazers, long thick-knit cardigans, shearlings, and suede toppers lined in curly lamb, all accessorized with knit caps and scarves piled high on the models' shoulders. Luxurious, yes, but nothing to set fashion types' hearts soaring. The only novelty was a reintepreted Kelly bag worn messenger-style at the hip. As a collection of French classics, it couldn't quite compete with the high-fashion news being made elsewhere in Paris. A simple presentation in the Hermès flagship on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré would have been more appropriate. The appeal of these low-key clothes is in the quality of the workmanship and in their hand (their touch and feel), and you can't get that experience when they're up on the runway.</p></div>"
91,fall,2008,f2008,herve-leger-by-max-azria,"Such is the (sex) appeal of the bandage dress that Max Azria was not only able to wrangle a front row of starlets, including Ginnifer Goodwin, Rose McGowan, Mandy Moore, and Joy Bryant, but he also got them to show up bare-legged and dressed to the nines early on a winter Sunday morning. It's these fresh, oft-photographed faces, after all, that have launched the brand's revival.</p><p>The house was founded in 1985 by Léger, now known as Hervé L. Leroux, at about the same time that Azzedine Alaïa was also experimenting with the borrowed-from-the-Egyptians technique. Azria, who acquired the label in 1998 and took over the design reins last year, has now tasked himself with the challenge of showing that the concept still has legs in the twenty-first century.</p><p>He divided his show into two parts, dedicating the first half to looks that unmistakably had his own signature attached. How to update an icon? With beads and feathers, insets of cashmere, and scribblelike appliqué, evidently. Azria's simplest additions were the most successful: Dresses made with airbrushed and dip-dyed bands stood out, as did subtle caviar beading. A charcoal wool bubble-band dress and corselet pants took the formula refreshingly off the red carpet. On the other hand, looks featuring organza apron skirts or raised Poiret-rose beading left the models looking like they had escaped from the Moulin Rouge. The show closed with a satisfying parade of iconic minis in luxurious colors like teal and amethyst. That was what everyone came for, and it suggested that the best way to reinvent a classic may be to not mess with it all that much.</p></div>"
92,fall,2008,f2008,house-of-holland,"Henry Holland and Agyness Deyn are the mascots of young London fashion, the self-made It boy and girl who, in the space of six months, invented themselves as a famously cheeky designer and the chirpiest cover girl in the business. Holland's still up to his fun and games. This season, he mythologized their friendship in a fake coat of arms (in which the figure of Aggy is emblazoned on a shield), persuaded her into a pair of plaid antlers, and had the model and her friends romp out in a Highland collection featuring a mauve-and-yellow fake House of Holland tartan, specially woven in Scotland.</p><p>For all his boisterousness, Holland, a former writer for the teen mag <em>Bliss</em>, is pushing himself to prove his capabilities as a designer—or more accurately, since he never went to fashion school, as an orchestrator who gets other people to help him make things he likes for a show. There were mini-kilts in tartan and pink or black mohair knit; skinny tartan trews with kilt buckles displaced to the ankle; and, in a clever morphing of two British classics, a trench-kilt hybrid that looked not just amusing but viably sellable.</p><p>The tartan/street theme raised a laugh and a bit of Brit nostalgia from anyone old enough to remember Vivienne Westwood's Highland-fling phase and its well-worn associations with teddy boys and punks. The fashion content stretched to a couple of iterations of London's latest pash for long dresses—a mid-calf T-shirt and a sweater dress—and accessories including jaunty oversize tam-o'-shanters and a funny extra-large sporran, made for Holland by the multitalented Katie Hillier.</p></div>"
93,fall,2008,f2008,iceberg,"The program notes cited pop artist Roy Lichtenstein as inspiration for the comic-strip print that appeared first as the lining of a jacket hood, then as part of a bright blue patchworked sheath, and eventually on coats edged in fur. In fact, a cartoonish undercurrent—something very much on the minds of showgoers after this morning's press conference for the Costume Institute's <em>Superheroes</em> exhibit—suffused the entire Iceberg collection. First there were the outsize, even outlandish proportions: tailored coats came with bulging, down-filled quilted sleeves; a puffer jacket was reimagined as a skirtsuit, its eccentric volume still intact. The theme then extended to embellishments: In the bodices of colorful, leopard-print silk chiffon gowns lurked abstract face masks. One model wore a black hood complete with feline ears à la Catwoman.</p><p>In the mix were some more approachable and seasonally on-message sweater dresses. That was a good thing. Much as we'd all like to be able to leap across buildings in a single bound—and do it in stilettos, why not?—it's not clear how many of these pieces will fit into a real-life wardrobe.</p></div>"
94,fall,2008,f2008,iris-van-herpen,"Today, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-couture/iris-van-herpen#all-seasons"">Iris van Herpen</a> is known for being the first designer to employ 3-D printing in a Fashion Week collection—but she didn’t start off that way. Though her practice has become associated with emerging technology, this child of “hippie” parents was raised in a smallish town in the Netherlands without a television or a computer. In fact, she continued to resist the latter when studying at ArtEZ Institute of the Arts in Arnhem. “I actually remember having a big conversation with my computer teacher because I was expected to create my drawings on the computer, and I really felt I didn’t need that for my creative process,” <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/article/iris-van-herpen-dutch-designer-interview-3d-printing"">Van Herpen told <em>Vogue’s</em> Mark Holgate</a> in 2016. “I still feel like that. Sitting behind a screen is not very creative in general, but I really believe in it for the future, so I go there.”</p><p>The designer wasn’t yet at that point when creating Chemical Crows, presented at Amsterdam Fashion Week less than two years after she graduated. Many of the looks, including the spiky finale pieces, were vaguely futuristic, but the influence of Alexander McQueen, with whom Van Herpen had interned, was also evident, aesthetically and in terms of inspiration. The Englishman was fascinated by birds, as was Van Herpen this season. Her collection was named for the large, garrulous black crows that populated the often gray skies around her studio; the designer was drawn both to their physicality and their symbolism. Associated with magic and alchemy, crows are considered to be spirit guides. Van Herpen mimicked the inky sheen of the bird’s feathers with black silk cords and created winglike structures from hundreds of spokes of children’s umbrellas.</p></div>"
95,fall,2008,f2008,isaac-mizrahi,"The man's career trajectory keeps spinning right round, baby. Out at Target and in at Liz Claiborne, Mizrahi presented his couture collection today in the middle of the ready-to-wear season. Many of these clothes—like a black tunic dress with crystal and fur embroidery—had an old-Hollywood-at-home feel to them, though a red sweater suit read very Jacqueline Kennedy, very first lady. The show would have benefited from an edit…and a bit of fun. Couture clothes, which require fittings, are for an established woman with the luxury of time, not for an active, spirited young woman with a MetroCard (i.e., the Liz Claiborne customer). Mizrahi's new position will have him designing clothes that fall between fast fashion and the couture lab, and we can't wait to see what he comes up with next.</p></div>"
96,fall,2008,f2008,j-mendel,"On paper, the marriage of designer and venue looked ideal: J. Mendel at the Plaza. Extravagant furs and glamorous gowns in a historic setting—how much more upscale can you get? Quite a bit, it turned out. Not only is the Plaza still a construction site, but Gilles Mendel chose to show on an old-fashioned prêt-à-porter-style raised runway that obscured the sight lines.</p><p>""In this age of disposable fashion, I wanted to create a collection that is all about lasting quality and making women look beautiful,"" he wrote in the program notes. Fair enough, but the execution lacked focus. Showcasing beauty and celebrating craft without a strong point of view leaves the audience looking at a parade of clothes with little context in which to understand them. Mendel showed more fur pieces than he has in the recent past, but while luxurious, they were not necessarily innovative. A number of otherwise promising-looking suits were burdened by two-pocket peplum belts.</p><p>There were moments when Mendel's workmanship made its presence felt. It was visible in spades in a series of micro-pleated gowns, as well as in the first-rate dusty rose finale number whose elegance matched that of the gilded ballroom.</p></div>"
97,fall,2008,f2008,jaeger-london,"To gauge what's going on at Jaeger, you have to understand the British term ""the high street"": It's the stretch of affordable fashion that supposedly takes in everywoman—a market that has recently been characterized by plummeting prices and a matching slump in standards. Jaeger sits at the upper end of that segment, a brand with the historical aura of a good-but-boring name about it, squarely set in the middle-income, middle-aged bracket, and not afraid to say it.</p><p>So when the audience rolled in for the debut of the brand's Jaeger London collection, expectations might fairly have been described as middling as well. What a surprise, then, when a great, shaggy brown-and-black goat-hair bomber marched out, followed by a nicely cut brass-buttoned caped jacket with a giant sou'wester cut in the same fabric, then loopy knitted chubbies, and more neatly tailored coats with stand-up collars and big patent buttons. More surprising yet, it managed to pull off the difficult trick of acquiring fashion content (a bit sixties, while avoiding egregious clichés) without insulting the existing customer. Can she be forty-plus and go for those double-knit bonded jersey flares with maybe a matching cape? Sure. They're an item with cross-references in international fashion (say, what Halston is doing in New York), but they'll be affordable and provide a great deal of presence at a conference table, too.</p><p>There are a few secrets behind this. One is that Jaeger's CEO, Belinda Earl, and her all-female team live that life and understand it. Two: The woman who took the bow is Karen Boyd, who had a label with Helen Storey in the late eighties. And three: They hired all-British super-league talent—Stephen Jones for the hats, Sam McKnight for hair, Russell Marsh for the casting, and British <em>Vogue</em>'s fashion director Lucinda Chambers as stylist. They spent the money, and it paid off. After the show, a delighted Earl said the collection starts wholesaling for the first time tomorrow.</p></div>"
98,fall,2008,f2008,jasmine-di-milo,"""I fell in love with Japanese anime,"" Jasmine Al Fayed told us of her Fall inspirations, ""and old-fashioned films.""</p><p>We didn't know whether to laugh or to cry when she added: ""I named one of the gowns 'Scarface.' "" Well, if you're a twentysomething designer, a movie made in 1983 probably does seem ancient.</p><p>All kidding aside, the long white one-shoulder number in question nailed Michelle Pfeiffer's killer look in the much-referenced De Palma flick. Once again, Al Fayed focused her attentions on party frocks. The best were mostly short and worn with red opaque tights: a boatneck, cap-sleeved style cinched with an anime-inspired plastic belt above a thigh-high slit, and a little black velvet mini with vertical darts that drew the eyes to a narrow waist. After the presentation, the designer said her sportswear was doing well in stores, too. The everyday appeal of her silk spaghetti-strap bodysuits, which will be sold in a rainbow of colors, is obvious (even if that of the slouchy metallic pants or a satin roller hoodie isn't).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vcdfj""></div></div><p>While Al Fayed might not score any prizes for fashion innovation, there were winners here: dresses that demonstrated a comfort and familiarity with what young women want to wear on a night out. It helps, of course, that her sister is the perennial party girl Camilla Al Fayed.</p></div>"
99,fall,2008,f2008,jason-wu,"Jason Wu picked up the Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award for women's ready-to-wear last month. Watching his Fall collection, it wasn't hard to see why. Just five seasons in, the 25-year-old's clothes display a sophistication of hand and of sensibility that have won him a loyal following of young socialites and starlets. For fall, it looks as though he'd like to extend his reach to working women—as-yet-untested territory for this designer. Among the cocktail and party dresses he loves to design were wide-leg, oversize herringbone trousers worn with silky bow-front blouses. And he showed his first-ever knits: snug sweaters topping full, calf-skimming skirts. Though pretty enough, these inevitably invoked Miuccia Prada's influential resort collection, as did the floral prints he used for deb dresses with soft V-necks, twisted bodices, and flaring skirts. In contrast, a pair of micropleat dresses—one strapless and to the knee and the other a belted, floor-length halter style—had a fresh appeal all Wu's own.</p></div>"
100,fall,2008,f2008,jean-paul-gaultier,"Forty-eight hours after Marion Cotillard wore a mermaid gown from his aquatic-themed January couture show for her Academy Awards victory lap—and, arguably, won the high-fashion red-carpet stakes—Jean Paul Gaultier was again plumbing Mother Nature for ideas. This time it wasn't the deep where he found inspiration…but you could say he went off the deep end, working furs and exotic skins every which way imaginable.</p><p>A faux tiger skin adorned the back of the first parka out, and a tiger print decorated a trademark trench. The latter had a poufy collar in the shape of a stole complete with four little feet, while a matte crocodile jacket came with tails made from the animal's actual tail. As for accessories, silk scarves edged in raw leather were pinned to the models' manes; other girls wore pelts on their heads, and two willing participants shaved a fish-scale pattern onto the backs of theirs. And how's this for the ultimate extravagance? A messenger bag and its straps made from black fox.</p><p>All of this played out as Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" mingled on the loudspeakers along with the sound of lambs baaing. Going to the slaughter? Really, it was just too much. Thankfully, interspersed among the outerwear were some pretty pieces, notably the delicate lace dresses and the black- or white-knit separates studded with matching pearls. Gaultier's boundless enthusiasm is what makes his shows such a pleasure to watch, but this time it was overkill.</p></div>"
101,fall,2008,f2008,jenni-kayne,"She might be from sunny Los Angeles, but Jenni Kayne's Fall collection showed she could cope with the cold—and turn on the heat. The show's moody palette and menswear fabrics, like a blue and black check, referenced grunge, as did the slouchy shape of the blazers. Kayne's second touchstone was the forties, which explains how a flannel jacket with a silver fox collar that radiated old-Hollywood élan came into the mix. What stood out most were the dressier pieces, like a color-blocked jersey scoop gown, because she is too into pretty to do <em>really</em> grungy.</p></div>"
102,fall,2008,f2008,jens-laugesen,"Jens Laugesen is working a big shoulder this season. ""It's a double shoulder pad, from men's tailoring,"" he explained. ""But I've been figuring out how to morph that with corsetry to make a fusion that's sexy."" That meant he'd followed up the teddy boy tux jackets that sold well from his Spring collection, refabricated them from gold lamé to electric-blue couture brocade, and added more drummer boy, DJ, and bomber shapes. They came out paired with skintight high-waist pants, body-hugging dresses, and a catsuit, to which the designer had added some concession toward comfort and fit in the form of panels of stretch in the back.</p><p>Still, as a look, it was pretty sharp and demanding—and for most women, probably more palatable when contrasted with his softer smock dresses, an element Laugesen termed his ""Laura Ashley moment.""</p></div>"
103,fall,2008,f2008,jeremy-laing,"The saturated palette of Bauhaus artist Josef Albers and his ""Homage to the Square"" paintings were Laing's starting point. You could see the Albers influence in the first look, an easy dress sewn together from two squares of silk, decorated with a block of Swarovski crystals. Loose-fitting tank dresses in vivid shades of orange and pink, with rectangles of fabric fluttering up and down the side seams, were a less literal take on the concept. The theme, though, threatened to get the best of the designer with the sleeveless dresses with nipped waists and slashes of extra fabric suspended from rivets at the neckline or waist; these, like the ""skirt-pants"" (which, as their name suggests, appeared to be slacks from the front and a long skirt from the rear), looked overdesigned. Laing said his focus was on tailoring. Lose all the extras, and he would've gotten the season's structured silhouette just right.</p></div>"
104,fall,2008,f2008,jil-sander,"To start his Fall collection for Jil Sander, Raf Simons set his team a technical challenge. ""I asked the tailors to work on dresses, and the dressmakers to get involved with the tailoring. I wanted to see how we could use heavy tweed in a fresh, elegant, architectural way."" The results: fitted dresses, with raised darts running vertically through the torso or horizontally around the body; jackets with high, asymmetrically wrapped funnel necks; a long essay on the pantsuit. It was severe, austere, and it kept many in the audience rapt at the sight of an intelligent designer working on a vision of dressing that applies to a life they actually find themselves leading.</p><p>Perhaps it takes an outsider to get a new perspective on this. Simons comes from menswear, from a tradition that respects practical end uses and appreciates how tiny calibrations of cut and fabric can change the sense of a garment. He's also equipped with an analytical mind that doesn't confuse the drive to be innovative with designing ""conceptually."" It's been a long time since womenswear designers have entered that kind of discussion, but now that a talent has cropped up who is attending to such issues as what to wear to work, or how to dress for evening while staying sleek and sophisticated, no wonder the fashion-disenfranchised are riveted.</p><p>There was plenty in this collection—the long-sleeve day dresses, the extraordinary tucked-wool evening column—to satisfy this audience. Truth to tell, though, there are aspects of Simons' work that need further refinement. One: The hobbling, painful footwear he insists on using is antithetical to a female-friendly aesthetic. Two: his pants. Something about them is still not working, after three seasons of his showing virtually the same shape. They may be as skinny as can be, but when the models walked away, something wrinkly was going on that really needs to be fixed. Preferably by a tailor rather than a dressmaker.</p></div>"
105,fall,2008,f2008,jill-stuart,"""Joan of Arc—a sophisticated revolutionary,"" said Jill Stuart backstage, explaining her choice of Fall muse. ""She's very intellectual, very audacious."" Sounds like a serious lass to us. But in the hands of Stuart, whose stock-in-trade is still a particularly sweet brand of girlishness, the situation wasn't quite so severe. Instead, the designer veered from the slink of a navy jersey dress toughened up with a military touch of braid trim on the shoulder to the more buttoned-up chic of a schoolgirl blazer with an insignia. There was also the straight prettiness of a strapless party dress, and the cool, masculine/feminine look of a lean velvet waistcoat. For accessories, Stuart gave her freedom fighter chain-mail jewelry, wide leather belts, and floppy gauntlet gloves. Like others who've shown this week, the designer was clearly fascinated by rich textures—velvet, sequins, matelassé, bouclé—and they added glimmer to the somber palette of black and navy. Though she could have made her point in fewer iterations, there was certainly something here for every Stuart fan.</p></div>"
106,fall,2008,f2008,john-galliano,"Where were we? Kubla Khan's stately pleasure dome, suggested the invite; a Vegas-style Buddha-themed garden, suggested the set—and a cavernous hall somewhere on the far-flung outskirts of Paris, according to the map. In fact, once the show actually started, we were firmly back in familiar John Galliano territory, the place where he gets to do all the things he loves with bias cutting, retro coats, and overblown headgear.</p><p>After the eye clicked onto the Poiret-period Orientalist houri pants and tassel-detailed, handkerchief-point gowns, the significance of the backdrop snapped into focus: It was a pastiche of a Rudolf Valentino-era silent-movie set, and Galliano was dressing the leading lady. He always adores a crazed actress as a muse, of course, though she's never one to be relied upon to stick to any literal script. This season, as ever, her wardrobe slipped between decades—from fragile bias-cut thirties chiffons and ruffled furs to forties-print dresses and flowerpot fifties hats to gargantuan knitted caps that could only have been dreamed up yesterday.</p><p>If it didn't make for one of Galliano's wildest collections, it will look good in stores. His delicious palette of dusty salmon pinks, pale blues, teals, and burgundies is guaranteed to reverberate amongst the sea of black that's destined to hit racks this fall. On top of that, there's news for fans to check out: Right on time to catch the season's excitement about jewelry, Galliano is launching his own line, which liberally bedecked the girls in the form of oversized brooches and neckpieces.</p></div>"
107,fall,2008,f2008,jonathan-saunders,"It's quite possible to imagine some of the bold, quasi-militaristic looks Scottish-born, London-based Jonathan Saunders showed at his New York debut today ending up in the Costume Institute's <em>Superheroes</em> exhibition. The designer and his sleek models beamed down to Gotham, presenting a tightly tailored collection that featured intricate piecing, panels, and sun-ray pleats that fit around the body like foil.</p><p>Among Saunders' starting points were Brancusi sculptures and Irving Penn sand collages. His imaginative journey also took in the realm of classic science fiction. But he returned to earth, literally, in terms of palette. Camel was the predominant tone throughout, and it worked wonderfully on both a monochrome halter dress with a side fall worn by Liya Kebede and a sexy-secretary number on Isabeli Fontana.</p><p>Saunders' big evening numbers were the standouts of the collection—especially striking was a snug black strapless tuxedo-y gown. It might be difficult for the average earthling to pull off the looks with billowing pleated panels, and some of the zip-front panel dresses seemed overcomplicated, but with this collection, Saunders proved he's no alien to sophisticated urban dressing.</p></div>"
108,fall,2008,f2008,jovovich-hawk,"""She's the girl rock stars write songs about,"" said Milla Jovovich of Jovovich-Hawk's Fall muse—T. Rex's Marc Bolan being the rock star in question. A Lurex-shot wrap gown rubbed shoulders with minidresses in mod stripes, while a boy-cut plaid suit with wide lapels and flared legs mixed with clingy knit shifts and pantsuits. What separates this collection from a trip to the vintage store? Not so much, really, except that it's edited and filtered through the rock 'n' roll sensibilities of Jovovich and her fellow model-turned-designer Carmen Hawk. They know what hip chicks like to wear, and maybe that's enough. That's what Target is banking on, anyway. The latest designers to join the brand's Go International project, the duo's retro restylings arrive in its stores early next month.</p></div>"
109,fall,2008,f2008,juan-carlos-obando,"Juan Carlos Obando, a Los Angeles-based Colombian who is an art director by day and designer by night, came east this season, bringing his eighth collection, intriguingly titled ""Liz Goldwyn vs. Frank Miller."" ""I wanted to show in the shadow of the Empire State Building,"" the designer said. ""It was time for the main stage.""</p><p>Obando had painstakingly hand-sewn each of the 14 looks on view today himself. They included a sheared purple coat made from 120 yards of silk chiffon, as well as simple-looking yet ingeniously constructed goddess dresses, which are something of a specialty for the designer. As for his inspiration—the invite featured the L.A. fashion figure Goldwyn as if drawn by a graphic artist like Miller—Obando didn't take it too literally. ""It's separate from the execution,"" he said. ""The superhero is woman."" If our powers of prediction are right, the designer is set for further adventures in Gotham.</p></div>"
110,fall,2008,f2008,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe is less a man of few words than a man of two words: That's all you'll ever get out of him (if you're lucky) after his shows. This season the words were ""geometric sculpture""—but as gnomic as that sounds, the amazing collection of draped gray jersey he had assembled actually needs no further explanation. There's a level at which intellectual justifications for clothing become tedious, and there was nothing difficult to understand about the beautiful complexities of the charcoal- and marled-gray knits Watanabe wound and rewound about the body in a zillion inventive ways.</p><p>Call it a modern progression of the thinking of Madame Grès or Madeleine Vionnet—the principles of Grecian draping thought through in knitted geometries of squares and circles. The technical wizardry allowed jersey to flow into belled sleeves that somehow were also part of the drape of a hem, or into fluid blousons and bubble-back silhouettes. The cumulative image was one of covered-up elegance (reemphasized by veiled faces and gloved hands) and a sinuous move toward a longer line.</p><p>Both developments place Watanabe firmly at the leading edge of this season's new ideas, even if the way he shows—in a long, drawn-out fugue of a presentation—is singularly at odds with most designers' sound-bite style of showcasing their work these days. Still, it was well worth hanging on to the end, for that was when Watanabe sent out a spot-on contribution to the season's debate about the need for new tailoring. Leaving aside the trouser skirts, in which the crotch was situated three inches above the ankle (please), the top halves were extraordinary feats of cut. The arms-free peacoats—in which the sleeves seemed to have become part of a caped back—turned an ordinary basic into something immensely desirable. Like the jackets in Watanabe's last ""African"" collection, those will have women fighting at the registers.</p></div>"
111,fall,2008,f2008,just-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli took a don't-mess-with-a-good-thing approach to his Just Cavalli collection. His seventies-inflected signature show for Spring received rave reviews, so why not revisit the decade at his little-sister line for Fall? Of course, the labels have different target audiences—Just Cavalli's could be described as teenagers with trust funds—so the references were no longer esoteric, but obvious: Janis Joplin crossed with Mick Jagger at Altamont is a fitting description.</p><p>Short smock dresses in a cheeky flamingo print worn with patterned tights shared the stage—er, runway—with maxidresses in bright florals. Slightly less out-there were a tangerine jersey pantsuit and an A-line camel coat. They vied for attention with stripy knit Lurex cardigans and extra-long scarves—and lost. If you're going to go vintage, why play it straight? In the glam-hippie mix, a leather motocross jacket that topped a python mini seemed out of place. The deep purple lamb-fur coat was more in keeping with the show's retro spirit. For many of the grown-ups in the crowd the long, colorful parade came off as much too familiar and theme-y, but his youngest fans—the ones born in the nineties—will likely forgive that. After all, this is probably their <em>first</em> seventies revival.</p></div>"
112,fall,2008,f2008,kai-kuhne,"Kai Kühne's work has sometimes been upstaged by dramatics in his personal life. But if there was any drama today, it was in the clothes: They were impeccable. ""I've learned a lot from people's judgment of my designs, and my behavior,"" said the designer, whose breakup with As Four was much discussed in the fashion media. ""And the result is that I filtered everything down to the purest sense of what I am about.""</p><p>What he is about, judging by today's outing, is spare elegance. It was easy to imagine Lisa Fonssagrives—or those Robert Palmer girls—in Kühne's combination of fifties and eighties elements. He cited Catherine Deneuve in <em>The Hunger</em> as a reference, but there was no tinge of vintage. Instead, there was a strictness of tailoring on, for instance, a seamed cocktail dress (which, in passing, revealed a geometric span of the back) that felt subtle and right for the times. Shoulders were strong and molded, as on a crisp white shirt worn with black pants, and coats were angular and asymmetric. Only the basket-weave pieces broke the purity of the line. The show was held among the clouds, in the Glass House at the top of the Chelsea Arts Tower, but Kühne demonstrated that his feet are planted on terra firma.</p></div>"
113,fall,2008,f2008,karen-walker,"It was the high-necked frills of Victorian and Edwardian children's clothing that started Karen Walker off this season. ""I love all those creamy nightgowns,"" said the designer backstage. ""And we threw in some street elements,"" she added. While the sweetly ruffled and pintucked look—worked liberally here into blouses and dresses—is an idea that has often been tapped in the past few years, Walker is a talented mix master with a vision that's wholly her own. The designer's turn-of-the-century-meets-street look had a youthquake vibe spanning decades, weaving in both sweetness and grooviness from the sixties and the layered, stripy tee-and-thermal insouciance of nineties grunge. The look gained some of Walker's characteristic whimsy with big, colorful my-gran-just-knitted-this pompom beanies, mittens, and even handbags. But not all was layered and accessorized to the hilt. On the simpler side was a terrific chic black textured silk sheath with ruffled shoulders. Walker's tailored pieces—shrunken tuxedo jackets, blazers, and even slim trousers—also deserve special mention. With the recent opening of her pop-up shop at East Village store Den, New York may soon find that it hearts Karen Walker.</p></div>"
114,fall,2008,f2008,karl-lagerfeld,"The show began, as usual, with boy-for-girl tailoring: Double- and single-breasted pinstripe jackets were worn over pleated miniskirts and flat patent oxfords; starchy white collars, not unlike the designer's own, peeked out from the jackets' lapels, this time with big bows replacing skinny ties. Austerity is too strong a word, but the tricky cuts and heavy-handed styling sometimes associated with the collection were absent. In their place were smartly wearable pieces like a belted vest dress that hit mid-calf; a narrow, fitted sheath with raised leather ribbing; and a jacket with a rounded eighties-ish shoulder and a built-in corset.</p><p>The Teutonic precision of Lagerfeld's tailoring was softened considerably come evening. Fur boleros embroidered with sequins, bugle beads, or larger square paillettes strode out on models with their arms folded haughtily across their chests. While it hardly qualified as vamping, it was a welcome change of pace to see the girls in something other than automaton mode. The best dress, a calf-grazing draped black number, came with crystals on the shoulders and a row of tiny buttons inching up one side of the back. Lagerfeld has a formula for his signature line, yes. But this season, his black, white, navy, and sparkle mix was more winning than most.</p></div>"
115,fall,2008,f2008,katy-rodriguez,"It was all unexpectedly sexy, as models in scarlet tights slunk around Mark Seliger's studio like caged cats, to the husky tones of Amanda Lear's ""I Am a Photograph.""</p><p>""We wanted them to look like the girl on Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music covers,"" Rodriguez said. ""Feline"" is the word that best describes her black body-con cocktail dresses. A lone bow capelet spoke to the old-time romance of past collections, while short-on-sugar-but-long-on-spice suits and dresses in sculptural and fitted shapes were constructed of wools, knit lace, cashmere, and lots of leather, patent and otherwise.</p><p>The birds-of-paradise that brazenly bloom everywhere in Los Angeles lit the march of Rodriguez's creative flame this season, and the inspiration grew to encompass birds, canyons, modern architecture, and machines. It was a collection that had not only been fired up, but—like a lot of the shows we've seen so far this week—had grown up, too.</p></div>"
116,fall,2008,f2008,koi-suwannagate,"Born in Thailand and a sometime collaborator with Phillip Lim, Suwannagate is known among the cognoscenti for her artful recycled cashmeres, most of which are conceived in three dimensions. It's not unusual to find rosettes on the back of a cardigan, say, or a vine of appliqués running down the rib cage of a dress. This was her first show in the New York big time, however. ""I realized it was now or never. You're never ready until you put yourself out there,"" the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund Award finalist said by phone before she left L.A. ""My nomination encouraged me to take it to the next level.""</p><p>The environment for Suwannagate's debut was orchestrated with great care. In addition to commissioning a hand-painted backdrop, she worked with a musician to compose a soundtrack of birdcalls to reinforce the hummingbird theme, which was also reflected in the palette and embroidery. As part of her push to expand her range, she is now making her own, more production-friendly knits, like a lovely cardigan with an attached scarf. The silhouette was attenuated, pieced skirts reached the ground. Dresses were often color-blocked and embellished, sometimes preciously so. While Suwannagate's work is very artsy-craftsy, and therefore a challenge for some, many insiders have already been won over. ""Just sooo beautiful,"" the front-row girls sighed.</p></div>"
117,fall,2008,f2008,kris-van-assche,"What to make of Kris Van Assche? The way he offered his womenswear—26 looks on seven models in an art gallery in Le Marais—was positively humble compared to the Sturm und Drang of his Dior Homme show or the conceptualized presentation of his own men's collection. And it was very much the better for it.</p><p>Though he insisted there was ""no big concept,"" he was inspired (not for the first time) by the tango, by that ""unique balance between a very strong woman and a very strong man."" There was a constant interplay between masculine and feminine: a man's suit, say, in gray woolen silk worn with the sorts of tops with elasticized necklines that the Latin love goddess Rita Hayworth made her own. There were obvious menswear references in a retooled peacoat or a black waxed-leather biker jacket, but Van Assche also masterfully worked a liquid-silver silk into multi-pleated shifts (knee-length and floor-length) that were entirely womanly. The sculptural volumes here were infinitely more successful than the ultra-pleats he is so fond of in his Dior menswear. Even so, a little levity is surely not too much to hope for (though it's probably futile at this point, given that one of the most striking pieces for Fall was a jacket in ottoman silk of an almost armorlike weight).</p></div>"
118,fall,2008,f2008,krystof-strozyna,"So many Poles have settled in London since the former Eastern bloc country joined the EEC that it was only a matter of time (three years, actually) before one of them turned out to be a fashion designer. The first to emerge is 25-year-old Krystof Strozyna, who has passed through Central Saint Martins' M.A. course to win funding from the New Generation sponsorship scheme. What set him apart in his graduation show was his strong way with graphic dressmaking and gigantic, lacquered neckpieces and cuffs that looked like nuts, bolts, and other abstract chunks of industrial hardware.</p><p>That's exactly what he showed again in his first official runway outing: short dresses in stiff cottons precision-cut with rounded volumes and graphic panels. The jewelry was there, too, some of it integrated within channels running down the fronts of dresses, or screwed onto necklines like conceptual door knockers. The dressmaking appeared to be technically accomplished (Strozyna produced the pieces in a factory in Poland), but his one-note, super-short lengths didn't quite jibe with the tenor of fashion now.</p></div>"
119,fall,2008,f2008,l-wren-scott,"The gallery-hopping designer moved her intimate presentation from Gagosian to Tony Shafrazi this season, where—to a star-studded audience that included Ellen Barkin, Kyra Sedgwick, Christy Turlington Burns, and Rachel Feinstein Currin—she showed a Victorian-inflected collection that was more than a just a little bit rock 'n' roll.</p><p>Keeping the silhouette slim and graphic, L'Wren Scott focused her attention on the details. Neat rows of brass buttons marched down the front of cocktail dresses. (They also showed up on the Christian Louboutin-designed shoes.) Motocross-like quilting revved up the seduction factor on a skirtsuit, while raised embroidery on a sweeping cape lent it an almost regal air. A pair of skinny jeans, meanwhile, had a fleur-de-lis motif extending down the back of each leg, and a gold gown featured a back bustle made of strips of lace that moved with laudable grace.</p></div>"
120,fall,2008,f2008,la-perla,"It's been a slow process, but La Perla has weaned itself from the overt sort of sexiness that had been the brand's most marked characteristic. Yes, the lingerie details were still there today—in silk georgette dresses edged with Chantilly lace, or on blouses with the sort of sheer neckline that inevitably draws the eye to the décolleté. But the too-obvious touches of recent seasons, like superfluous bras and whaleboning worn on the outside of clothes, were happily absent. This brought up a new issue, though: What, exactly, should the focus of the brand's ready-to-wear business be? For Fall, the buzzwords backstage were the ""nouvelle vague"" and the ""nonchalant elegance"" of one of its heroines, Jeanne Moreau. That translated into a smartly cut bracelet-sleeve coat trimmed at the hem with fox and worn with narrow flared pants, as well as a metallic copper strapless cocktail dress. Both of those fared better than the cheetah-print numbers or the pleated floor-length gowns in a sheer chiffon that awkwardly exposed under-slips ending above the knee. On the evidence of this show, La Perla's identity is still a work in progress.</p></div>"
121,fall,2008,f2008,lacoste,"A sheepskin runway and a soft snowfall set the stage for Christophe Lemaire's ski extravaganza. The collection was inspired by Megève, the Alpine resort popularized in the twenties by the Baronne Noémie de Rothschild, who was fed up with the crowding at St. Moritz. Lemaire began on a quietly glamorous note with sportif separates in creams and dove grays, all invitingly bundled in giant scarves and finished with high-heeled hiking boots. The off-slope wear that followed was similarly smart, energetic, and fresh-scrubbed in a way that did justice to Lacoste's high-preppy past. And just when you thought you might be lulled into a cozy doze by all the tasteful navy, loden, and gray, jolts of color arrived to the après-ski party in short sherbet-striped dresses, Day-Glo jackets, and long socks worn disco nights-style over tight jeans. Lemaire turned the funk up to 11 with flourishes of Rasta-chic red and gold. ""Don't ask me why!"" he said, when asked backstage for an explanation. Well, this label is about fun, pure and simple…and fun doesn't always need a reason.</p></div>"
122,fall,2008,f2008,lanvin,"If there is one collection that encapsulated everything that's best about Fall—and gave it a high degree of personal expression—it would be Alber Elbaz's for Lanvin. You want the simplicity of a stark, covered-up, carved-out silhouette? It's here. You're craving a dose of multifaceted opulence with it? That's here, too. And what about a sexy, simple evening dress powerful enough to force you to spend, no matter how much? Look no further.</p><p>In one way, Elbaz's collection was a feat of technical genius. He'd started off by making fabric out of strips of grosgrain ribbon, winding hundreds of meters of the stuff around the body to make shapely dresses, blouses, and skirts—a step on from the free-flowing plissés of his Summer collection. What makes him so special, however, is the humility and realism of his focus. Instead of getting lost in the detail, he said, ""Part of a designer's job is to be pragmatic. Not to be ashamed to think about making life easy for a woman.""</p><p>The result was a tour de force of innovation and simplicity sparkled up with the most outrageously excessive jewelry—door knocker-sized crystals, slabs of gilt, giant cuffs. Every calibration of usefulness was represented, from plain wool work-ready day dresses and pantsuits through knockout fur and patent coats, asymmetric body-molding cocktail options right up to blindingly brilliant dresses made of vertical ribbons loaded with gold sequins. In a season when so many have anxiously cast around for what women will want in a recession, Elbaz has intuited the best answer of all: Give us restraint, give us pragmatism, but never slam the door on the possibility of utter gorgeousness.</p></div>"
123,fall,2008,f2008,lela-rose,"""How can I add a sporty theme to cocktail dressing?"" was the question Lela Rose asked herself while developing her Fall collection, which she summed up as ""Susie Chapstick meets Park Avenue."" The designer has been quietly exploring sportif elements for two seasons, but this time she was really ready to scrimmage, dedicating almost a third of the looks—from a goldfinch-colored taffeta parka to a red paillette tank dress with a tank back—to the active side of things. We're not talking about hoodies and sweatpants, of course; these pieces are hardly suited for a suburban soccer game, though they may be just right for the kind of social maneuvering that Rose's well-heeled clients train for.</p><p>The Park Avenue part of the show's equation is the one that Rose knows and loves best. Fall found her playing with flowers, bows, and feathers—without laying it on too thick. ""I wanted to do refined cocktail with more rock-star glamour, like that of a young Jerry Hall,"" said Rose, referencing her fellow Texan. So, the girly scallops and lace overlays of past seasons were scrapped in favor of more sophisticated ruffles and tiers and subtle shine, which really scored.</p></div>"
124,fall,2008,f2008,limi-feu,"Limi Yamamoto, a.k.a. Limi Feu, is in a unique position. There is no obvious parallel for a designer's offspring following quite so closely in daddy's bootsteps. But if Limi's designs reflect papa Yohji's, they also exemplify a new Japanese attitude.</p><p>The generational shift was most obvious in the way that Limi proudly showed her clothes on a posse of characterful Tokyo women, rather than on a parade of interchangeable Eastern European blond tweens. Then there's also the fact that, as a post-post-WWII baby, Limi is imprinted with a very different set of associations than those ground into the DNA of the Japanese main guard. Asymmetry, androgyny, and Edwardiana—all territory blazed by Yohji, et al.—were there, for sure, but she gave them a little girlish froth. Hence, a black knit micro dress, or a white Aran knit paired with matching mohair boots.</p><p>Limi was her father's daughter in the monochrome palette and the severe black tailored pieces. (Are Japanese children raised by fierce nannies?) But she also had fun with the proportions of bubble skirts and princess coats. Perhaps this strict-playful dichotomy is a byproduct of life in a (post-)imperial island nation, because Vivienne Westwood has been prone to something similar at odd points in her career. On the other hand, it was Ry Cooder's ""Paris,Texas"" that came over the sound system…so maybe what was sweeping through an apron skirt and a dress with a trompe l'oeil messenger bag thrown across it was more of a frontier spirit.</p></div>"
125,fall,2008,f2008,louis-vuitton,"The new, punctual, be-suited Marc Jacobs stood backstage after his Louis Vuitton Fall collection and briskly rattled off the need-to-know: ""We just worked with shapes. Darts, folds, and pleats. I don't like to use these words because they sound pretentious, but if you like, last season was painterly, and this season's sculptural.""</p><p>In essence, what he'd just shown was a more shapely and pulled-together version of the eighties-inflected collection he'd sent out under his own name in New York. If it led to puzzlement at first viewing, now, at least, his intentions can be read in context. Four weeks is a long time in fashion, and in the interim other designers—most notably Stefano Pilati at YSL—have been pushing big pleated pants, scrolliform necklines, and standout dirndls in heavy fabrics.</p><p>At Vuitton, what with the abstract conical fez, ballooning pants, and blocklike pump-wedges, the silhouette seemed to have been drawn from Grace Jones in her early eighties heyday, or the moment when Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana dominated Paris fashion. It's never quite that exact in Jacobs' hands, of course, but compared with last season's random, chopped-up, multicolored collage, this was a total top-to-toe grown-up look treated to a toned-down palette of muted browns, dusty blues, mint, and black.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""yoslyf""></div></div><p>In some ways it seemed right. This is a moment when many designers have intuited the need to chuck out the junk and get back to the cutting table. At Vuitton, even the bags—the bellwether of every change in the economics of desire—have been stripped of jingly junior doodads and are now quieted down to the point where the branding is only visible on embossed surfaces.</p><p>The question is whether that meant throwing out baby with bathwater. When the overexaggerated shapes calmed down, some chic things emerged, especially toward evening: a long-sleeved dress with a standout whorl at the hip, a strapless sheath with a caged tulle bustle, and a couple of crinolined dance dresses. Otherwise, though, it was lumpy going.</p></div>"
126,fall,2008,f2008,louise-goldin,"It's only her second season showing, but Louise Goldin stepped onto the runway with a reputation for pushing sweater dressing into a new zone of fashion relevance. After her small but widely acclaimed Spring show of bright, short shapes, she needed to over-deliver to impress, and she knew it. ""Since the minute I finished the last collection,"" she explained, ""I was researching Inuit culture and sci-fi, experimenting with computer programs so I could mix traditional pattern with the pixelation you'd see on a monitor screen."" The result: a parade of ""Space Eskimos"" equipped with short multi-patterned dresses, some padded, others armorlike in the shoulder; thermal body-hugging catsuits; and fur-trimmed jersey parkas. (In a prestigious collaboration for a young designer, Pierre Hardy stepped in to design the shoes—fab patent cutaway high heels with integrated stripy socks.) The result, close-up, is a feat of engineering ingenuity that also contains a lot of sensible girl-think, which should put her in good stead as the chill winds of recession set in. Break down this sophomore collection, and buyers will find roomy sweater dresses and regular knits alongside the more demanding fit-and-flare body-con pieces and the pricier fox-trimmed jackets.</p></div>"
127,fall,2008,f2008,luca-luca,"Fall represented a major shift for Luca Orlandi. He bid adieu to Bryant Park in favor of a small West Chelsea gallery and, instead of a runway show, presented a tight collection of 20 looks. ""It's very couture, so we wanted people to see it up close,"" explained Orlandi's newly installed creative director, Raul Melgoza.</p><p>Melgoza cited as inspiration artist Ernesto Caivano's exquisite drawings of a medieval love story in which a long-separated couple sends messages through birds. But this is clearly a new day at Luca Luca—the execution almost qualified as subtle, particularly when you consider last Fall's glitzy après-ski fest. The avian and woodland theme appeared in a winglike caped sleeve on a plain silk dress or tiny peacock-feather paillettes embroidered on a satin L.B.D.</p><p>In all, it was a thoughtfully designed, luxurious collection that hit all the necessary wardrobe points for a lady-who-10022s—i.e., an effortless jersey dress with a draped neck for lunch, a broadtail shift with a sliver of jeweled neckline for cocktails, and a strapless Chantilly lace gown delicately worked with marabou for night. It will be interesting to see how Orlandi's customers adjust to flying under the radar.</p></div>"
128,fall,2008,f2008,luella,"Why is it that so many designers are surreptitiously delving into horror movies to rev their engines? Only last night, Giles Deacon was murmuring about Roger Corman's <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em>. In New York, the Mulleavy sisters disclosed their liking for Japanese slasher movies. And last season, Christopher Kane was crazed for <em>Carrie</em>, Stephen King, all that. And now here's Luella Bartley, talking about ""Britt Ekland in <em>The Wicker Man</em> and the witch museum in Boscastle, Cornwall, where we live,"" before adding, ""I wanted something a bit raw and pagan."" What's this? Generalized cultural anxiety seeping to the surface in the form of fashion?</p><p>But, oh, stop. We're attending to a Luella collection here, and what we see before us is something (as the designer puts it) ""cute but always a little sick—that's my girl."" So there she is, working a quirky twisted-felt witchy hat, a short gray coat, a puff-sleeved peasant blouse, and high-heeled clogs, for starters. Happily, it didn't get much scarier than that, for the collection was dense with easy-to-wear pieces rather than sinister subtext—fitted black-and-red-check country jackets with puffed sleeves, cord jodhpurs, smocked blouses, a great herringbone single-breasted coat with perked-up shoulders, and a slew of accessories. Hard as it is for any designer to think of anything new to put on a bag, Bartley's English-village observations sparked the idea of taking the jingly bells and multicolored ribbons of Morris dancers' costumes and loading them onto satchels and totes.</p><p>In other words, it wasn't to be taken terribly seriously—except for the fact that, eight years on from her first showings in Portobello, Bartley is now the mother of three under five, with a proper brand to her name and a knack for keeping it young and witty. Kudos to her for that.</p></div>"
129,fall,2008,f2008,luisa-beccaria,"The show was moved this season from Luisa Beccaria's Brera district shop, with its sparkly pastel walls, to Milan's soulless Fiera—and what was gained in convenience was lost in intimacy. It's not a negligible point for a designer who built her success as much on the charm of her personal story and the gorgeous looks of her young brood as on her pretty party frocks. Location aside, this was typical Luisa Beccaria: frothy, sweeter than a candy shop, and without so much as one rough edge. Citing points of reference as divergent as Whistler and the seventies photographer Sarah Moon, she worked mostly in an opalescent palette of soft pinks, pale blues, and silvery whites, with shots of Fall's popular iridescent purples and greens. Daytime offerings included a Shetland wool shift with lacelike embroidery on the patch pockets, a crocheted dress with delicate needlework at the yoke, and a frilly bow-front blouse worn with an A-line skirt. For evening—where her heart is—Beccaria ranged from a pouf-skirted dance dress with a sweetheart neckline to ruffled tulle trapezes that overpowered her models' narrow frames.</p><p>Among the more interesting pieces were a peacock-feather-print day dress worn with a wide, striped suede belt and a floor-length net dress with a plunging V-neck and cap sleeves in allover ribbon embroidery. Subtle and sophisticated, they saved the collection from becoming too precious and doll-like.</p></div>"
130,fall,2008,f2008,maison-martin-margiela,"Martin Margiela is one of the main engines of fashion change in our times, a man whose design process normally disregards current trends so completely that what he does one season (to general ridicule) will likely be absorbed by the mainstream a year later: Witness the padded shoulder, pioneered by Margiela in Spring 2007, and now unquestioningly co-opted into ""normal"" tailoring across the board. That aesthetics-shifting power makes him a bit of a fashion insider's rock star, which is why a pre-gig anticipatory buzz hovered over an audience that scrambled for seats in a packed sports arena before his Fall show. Margiela played it up, too, with spotlights on girls emerging from backstage and the wail of heavy metal on the soundtrack.</p><p>But did the earth move? Not so seismically that you could predict a reconfiguration of the future landscape. To begin with, Margiela's women stalked out in bodysuits with one-legged fishnet skirts or a series of extreme, diagonally sliced silk capes trailing over them. The image had a hard-core, long-line glamour, the sexual frisson underlined by knee-high snakeskin boots, floor-stabbing heels made from six-inch nails, and later, leather boot leggings zippered up the back.</p><p>On the wearable side of the ledger, Margiela chalked up one-shouldered leopard-spot tops, halters suspended from a kind of metal clerical collar, and a few nice but (for him) puzzlingly noncontroversial envelope clutches. If that was a small concession to commerciality, he didn't give any ground on his new idea for tailoring. Unfortunately, it centered on the dreaded funnel neck, an idea that has been rising with bewildering frequency in other collections this season. Margiela's were the most extreme on the scene so far—shoulderless jackets and knits rising up past the ears (an effect pioneered by Viktor &amp; Rolf some seasons ago). What to make of it? A theoretical indicator that will push a more vertical silhouette in seasons to come, maybe, but in this form, not exactly a look you can imagine being sported, as Margiela's padded shoulder has been, up and down the front row.</p></div>"
131,fall,2008,f2008,malo,"Fall found Roberto Rimondi and Tommaso Aquilano and their models going around in circles. The show was held on an oval catwalk, and there was a round-and-round theme to embellishments and patterns.</p><p>The rings worked well on a printed silk dress with subtle circular insets, and on a series of short, full skirts that managed to look modern and not retro fifties. But when the circle motifs were applied to thicker knits, the result was a heavy pod structure that overwhelmed the frail models at times. Although the Italian designers were hoping to capture an oceanic-tribal vibe, the result was more cyborg.</p><p>There was ambition here. The celestial details scattered throughout were inspired by the bull's-eyes and starry canvases of Richard Pousette-Dart, a pioneering abstract expressionist whose work Aquilano discovered at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. And the hand-treated angoras looked incredibly soft, like gossamer swansdown. (""We're trying to make knitwear that doesn't fit the conception of what knitwear looks like,"" the designers explained through a translator before the show.) But however well crafted the clothes were, in the end they were overwhelmed by the concept.</p></div>"
132,fall,2008,f2008,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Marc by Marc Jacobs usually follows the designer's main show by about 18 hours. But with his signature collection scheduled for the last day of New York fashion week, looking at his diffusion line this season felt a bit like reading tea leaves. Does the eighties-ish new-wave vibe of the clothes on today's runway in any way predict what we'll see come Friday?</p><p>A blue tweed shift with a stand-up collar and a drop waist, accessorized to the hilt with shades, beret, and checked bag, kicked things off. Following that, Jacobs showed a few pairs of pants, slouchy and full through the upper legs. But this was a girly collection, long on dresses and skirts. The former came in podlike shapes (a supersized green and black houndstooth) or nipped at the waist above flaring hoop skirts (a witty fishnet print), while the latter appeared as bubbles, cheerleader minis, and lamp shades. Also in the mix was some great outerwear—everything from a belted, boxy man's single-breasted jacket to a black trapeze coat with a checkerboard of patent leather below the waist. We'll have to wait a few days for the big reveal, but there was plenty in this bright, playful lineup to keep Jacobs' fans happy in the meantime.</p></div>"
133,fall,2008,f2008,marc-jacobs,"""We're ready, we're ready to start the show."" That was Marc Jacobs himself, addressing the audience from the stage (stage, not runway) at 7:11 p.m. At 7:17, as Kevin Federline was still taking his seat in one of the makeshift, nightclub-style VIP booths not far from Selma Blair, Gretchen Mol, and Helena Christensen, Sonic Youth struck the first dissonant chord of ""Jams Run Free,"" and Jacobs' first model walked out past the band. She wore a shawl-collar pouch-back coat in a shade that looked like camel, although we can't say for sure, concert lighting not being the best kind to illuminate such details. (One thing was immediately clear—whether he shows on a Friday or a Monday, it's always going to be an event.)</p><p>The day switch and that revolutionary mere-17-minutes-behind-schedule start time weren't the only changes since last season. If Spring was all about sex, overt sex specifically, this show—his old friend Kim Gordon's gyrations notwithstanding—had a willfully sedate quality.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>Afterward, when asked about his inspirations, Jacobs replied, ""I really wasn't very inspired this season. I just live my life."" OK. When pressed, he offered a few more words: ""Calm. Glamour. Casual. Beautiful women."" Vague as that sounds, it was in fact an apt description for a collection that hinted at the eighties of Jacobs' early days in New York. It was there in the puffy headbands the models wore around their foreheads and the clubby atmosphere inside the Armory (some said it gave them Regine's, though the set's menacing scaffolding and the unsettling black-and-white images that played on a screen behind the band also suggested a more downtown environment). And it was there in the palette of soft pastels and grays and the relaxed (in terms of shape, not sensibility), somewhat masculine cut of the classic clothes.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dgcce""></div></div><p>Jacobs showed plain-front button-downs with straight skirts; almost preppy popcorn-knit sweaters with narrow shorts; a cashmere sweater that spelled out HARDCORE paired with baggy leather pants; and a thigh-length bomber over a full, shin-grazing skirt. But his big focus was jackets and coats, many of which came with vertical folds of fabric gathered in the back above wide, hip-slung sashes. Dresses, too, came with pronounced volumes at the back. For evening, their stiff folds were replaced by gold or silver lamé pantsuits (paging Loulou de la Falaise) and drippy bias-cut velvet gowns.</p><p>Was this collection, in its relative tameness and intriguing air of sexless safety, a rebuff of sorts to last season's detractors, who reprimanded Jacobs as much for his off-the-wall collection as for his perennial lateness? Could be. These clothes are challenging for different reasons than were the difficult transparent pieces he featured for Spring, but they'll be no less coveted. As for the show's accessories, women everywhere will have Jacobs to thank when other designers follow his lead and start producing a lower heel. That's the power of Jacobs' mystique.</p></div>"
134,fall,2008,f2008,marchesa,"With the <em>Vanity Fair</em> Oscar party canceled and the fate of the awards show itself still in the balance, Georgina Chapman and Keren Craig were smart to scale back the number of red-carpet dresses in their presentation. What their Hollywood clients need now is something less grand, but not—and this is key—something less glamorous. Marchesa's Fall presentation had glamour in spades, from the opening high-neck red suede above-the-knee dress with bunches of organza roses for sleeves, to the plunge-front black silk tuxedo one-piece. Both paid subtle tribute to the duo's chosen muse, Queen Elizabeth I, who, Craig explained, was forced to keep her femininity hidden despite her awesome power. Hence the aforementioned high neck and the pants (no matter that the Virgin Queen never actually wore trousers).</p><p>Chapman and Craig's decision to allude only loosely to the famous monarch paid off in such pieces as an aubergine satin and organza cocktail dress that draped from the neckline to the knees. There was a new structure to these clothes, as Craig herself was eager to point out. Take a stunning black dress with an hourglass shape so sculpturally defiant, it evoked armor. Anybody who wore it would be paparazzi-proof. You didn't expect Marchesa to completely forsake the red carpet, did you?</p></div>"
135,fall,2008,f2008,marios-schwab,"London is thinking long—sinuously, serpentinely long in the case of Marios Schwab's incredibly impactful Fall silhouette. Schwab is the first to completely nail the new look in a bravely exaggerated form: smooth, tubular, hobbling stretch dresses to the ankle, with strange textures breaking through their surfaces. Some of them had patches of under-things—jeans or poufy upswellings of flesh-colored Lycra—rising through roughly scissored slits. Others were covered with filigree-fine laser cutouts engineered to look like sooty, flaking Victorian William Morris wallpaper.</p><p>It was strange, it was sinister—and mesmerizing. Without doubt, it threw up a glaring issue about how anyone could wear it as is (if you wanted to perambulate across a room within five minutes, forget it). But by the end, the cumulative effect neutralized that kind of pragmatic niggle. This was Schwab's most conceptual collection yet, arguably one that is powerful enough to push the reset button in how we see proportions.</p><p>What led him here was a reading of a Victorian proto-feminist novel, <em>The Yellow Wallpaper,</em> by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, followed by a collaboration with the artist Tom Gallant on the prints. Those influences scarcely matter to the results, though, which look new and ""out there"" in a way few designers dare in these days of commercial constraints. Not that there weren't salable-looking, impeccably made navy peacoats (two, tramline straight, were elongated to hit the ankle). The point is that this is one of those symbolically charged collections that may be a bellwether. Longer is beginning to feel better: It's a visual that's been moving inward from the margins since Roland Mouret and Jonathan Saunders also dropped their hemlines to mid-calf. If it seems crazy now, let's wait and see: The judgment call will only come after every other designer has had his say.</p></div>"
136,fall,2008,f2008,marni,"In a season when ""simplicity""—or, more accurately, a redefinition of the dead term ""minimalism""—is preoccupying fashion debate, Consuelo Castiglioni filled in the blanks with color. She has a painterly eye for an offbeat choice of shades: dove gray against sugar pink, emerald with beige, sharp yellow and dusty mauve, muted pastels butting up against the odd shocking-bright hue. The shapes? Well, they were the lumpy-fit Marni classics that have unwittingly spawned a zillion cruder replicas: loose tunics, clunky cropped pants, quirky capes and dresses with sleeves cut to pouf out in unexpected directions.</p><p>Layered up, it made a statement about color-blocked, tiered dressing and contrasting textures, topped off with dyed-fur gilets and capelets (a reminder of Marni's beginnings as a fur house). Truth to tell, there wasn't enough forward momentum in the clothes to break new ground—even in the prints, which were mainly limited to a couple of shadowy checks and a swirly pattern, possibly inspired by stained-glass windows. Still, the accessories picked up the slack: Stripe-printed tights and socks, leather gauntlets, nerdy-chic sunglasses, furry backpacks, sequined tie-on neckpieces, and open-toed platform knee boots were all quirky items that will keep the faithful very happy indeed.</p></div>"
137,fall,2008,f2008,martin-grant,"Retailers love his kind of clothes: sophisticated, but not severe, suits and dresses that nod in the direction of trend but don't come with a built-in ""best before"" date. And today Martin Grant duly delivered on his fans' expectations with a collection that came in a woman-friendly palette of orangey-red and electric blue, as well as black, navy, camel, and ivory. He opened with a flame-red coat that will be like a beacon on the sales floor; it had two big, black buttons on a capelike overlay above a belted waist. His other coats were either true capes (a striking camel cashmere one, worn with black cigarette pants, fell to the hips from a stand-away collar) or came with short dolman sleeves, a big fur collar, and self-belts.</p><p>The designer played with different volumes when it came to dresses, too. A silk-satin sack and a drapey jersey were V-shaped, with a lot of room up top and narrowed skirts. But then he showed a gorgeous white charmeuse hourglass with a single, subtle rosette at the hem. Its counterpoint was a dramatic ivory smoking jacket with satin lapels, worn with long, full pants with permanent creases. This was Grant at his reality-chic best.</p></div>"
138,fall,2008,f2008,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson's girl is a global traveler, but for Fall she's returning to her roots. ""It's very English in spirit,"" said the designer. ""I had a vision of a girl in the depths of the countryside, rustic and earthy."" There were clever Fair Isle sweaters, skirts, and leggings monogrammed with ""MW,"" and day dresses in a rose print that looked like the faded wallpaper you'd find in a cozy cottage. But it became increasingly clear that Williamson's definitions of terms were rather loose. His parkas and anoraks were cut from crinkly metallic nylon and came with fox-trimmed hoods, his shearlings were patent, and as for his boots, his muse won't be getting far in the muck wearing those high-heeled tapestry-covered spectators.</p><p>Indeed, you can take the boy out of the city, but you can't take the city out of the boy. Williamson's party frocks are what draw stars like Rihanna to his front row—no, unfortunately she didn't emulate Prince's surprise performance at Williamson's Spring show in London. But the designer's chosen theme served him not so well after dark. The neon tree print he used for a long dress and a capeleted mini came off as gimmicky. He'd be smart to keep this romance with the great outdoors brief.</p></div>"
139,fall,2008,f2008,maurizio-pecoraro,"You could call shrouding feathers in tulle and covering gem-bright Swarovski crystals with metal chains a concession of sorts to the so-called return of minimalism on the part of maximalist Maurizio Percoraro. But then again, probably not: It only meant more embellishments. When he wasn't busy embroidering his alpacas and bouclés—witness a standout pair of dresses with fringes of beads that swished back and forth as the models made their way down the runway—he was playing around with their volumes. The sleeves of one coat melted from the elbow to the wrist in softly undulating folds, while cocktail dresses came draped at the back or billowing with extra fabric.</p><p>At times, the lavish beadwork and volume play, a big trend for several seasons now, gave this collection a been there, done that feeling. But it was not without its beautiful pieces: Take a sack dress and a similarly roomy coat, both patchworked with individually tie-dyed squares of silk velvet that had the subtle shadings of stained glass. Props to Pecoraro for doing what he believes in.</p></div>"
140,fall,2008,f2008,max-azria,"""It's a bit stronger, a bit sexier,"" said Lubov Azria backstage before the show, holding up as evidence a trapunto-stitched bra, to be worn Madonna-style over your clothes. Fall, explained Mrs. Azria, was essentially an evolution of Spring's boudoir-inspired show. But the underwear-as-outerwear did make you wonder whether the Azrias' clothes were actually evolving from boudoir to bawdy. That wasn't quite the case on the runway, however: Despite the presence of external underthings and glimpses of under-underthings, any brazen sexuality was muffled by the heavy fabrics and muted hues of Fall in a crowded show that could have used a little more focus. Instead, it was sex as accessory—a corset to cinch a sweater dress with a saucy bit of taffeta peeking out, or a garter just barely visible through a silk gauze trench. With an abundance of skirts, dresses, and an overall emphasis on the waist, there was a lot of lady present here, but the most interesting looks juxtaposed her with a practical, tomboy touch—a color-blocked T-shirt fastened with a stitched brassiere, tucked into soft cashmere pants that might do double duty as pajamas. Perhaps the next evolution come Spring?</p></div>"
141,fall,2008,f2008,max-mara,"There's a cadre of girls who are getting into tailoring now—they're out there at the shows, working strong-shouldered blazers over dresses, and striding around looking good in sharp-line pants again. That's a trend swing sure to track upward for Fall, but after such a long phase in which designers have ditched structure for bubble shifts, who's left that can still cut it? MaxMara is one company that remains equipped to do the job properly, and its Fall collection smartly laid the jackets, tweeds, and impeccable coats on the line.</p><p>According to the program notes—and the soundtrack—Roxy Music-era London glam was the inspiration. That gave a (thankfully mild) seventies-slash-forties excuse for a tweed coat with bristling fox-fur sleeves that opened the show, and the tweaked-up padded shoulder lines that followed from there. There were fine alpaca coats and sleeveless, slightly A-line jackets whose cuts followed in the slipstream of the ideas pioneered by Stefano Pilati and Roland Mouret last season. The reiteration of the shoulder kept coming in knitwear, including boleros done in oversize Aran-knit patterns with thick cable tubes circling the upper arm. After that, a slow drift into tinsel cardigans, sweaters, and unforgiving Lurex jersey dresses threatened to wipe out the classiness, but never mind. The moral: MaxMara looks best when it's not trying too hard, as demonstrated by the charcoal-gray pantsuit and chiffon tie-necked blouse with a coat jacket shrugged over the shoulders by the insouciant Lily Donaldson. That's the way to do it.</p></div>"
142,fall,2008,f2008,meadham-kirchhoff,"Edward Meadham and Benjamin Kirchhoff opened a menswear label after meeting at Central Saint Martins in 2002. For two years, they've struggled to find a voice in womenswear, and now, under the aegis of New Generation sponsorship, they had their first chance to articulate a vision on the official catwalk. ""Urban sophistication,"" Meadham tagged it, with Kirchhoff adding, ""We're trying to think of professional women who want to look gorgeous in different moods—and we want to give them wardrobe essentials to do that.""</p><p>As a slightly dark pair of grown-up biker-goths, their angle is oblique (in a good way). If they cut a brown wool business suit, it's well proportioned with a short jacket that has curved vents in back, and when they approach a motorcycle jacket, it ends up a hybrid of Coco and armor. Best in show, though, were their lace-and-chiffon blouses and long, sinuous skirts, which, when topped with a black Mongolian fur chubby, create a version of the long, drawn-out silhouette London is talking about.</p></div>"
143,fall,2008,f2008,michael-kors-collection,"Amy Winehouse wouldn't have been Alfred Hitchcock's type. He liked his ladies blond first and prim second. But Michael Kors didn't let that stop him from mashing up the two influences at his Fall show. After the lights dimmed and the photographers were finally done snapping pics of fashionably late celebrities Natasha Richardson, Sigourney Weaver, Debra Messing, and Ellen Pompeo, out came Kors' heroines: hyper-polished Kim Novak types with teased updos that stopped several inches short of the Winehouse stratosphere. They wore sheaths in a lilac and olive floral, balmacaans, and camel suits with a new longer, narrow skirt. They flung sable coats over their cashmere sweaters and cropped ocelot-print pants, or slipped mink stoles over tweedy jackets and glen plaid skirts. And they carried frame bags in the crooks of their elbows. Come cocktail hour, their options ranged from a strapless dress in gold matelassé to a silvery princess frock embellished with a bow. And for really gala evenings, there were column gowns with Watteau backs.</p><p>Was it retro? Well, yes. And it looked familiar, too: The era has been plumbed to its depths. But it never felt too costumey. And it helped that he reined in his natural exuberance when it came to accessories. Well schooled as Kors is in the early sixties and the ways of Hollywood, maybe he should ditch <em>Project Runway</em> for a part on <em>Mad Men</em>?</p></div>"
144,fall,2008,f2008,missoni,"Missoni laid on a quietly intimate welcome to the opening of a chilly Milan fashion week—a smaller, cozier venue, a glass of spumante, a bite to eat beforehand. That set a civilized tone that extended to the clothes, which struck a grown-up note in enveloping graphic outerwear, muted colors, double-faced cashmere, flannel, mink, and crocodile clutches.</p><p>It's certainly a refocusing of the brand's former something-for-everyone mélanges of items, and, reading between the inverted-trapeze ponchos and tweed-and-fur dresses, perhaps a deliberate effort to appeal to a luxury customer who won't be as affected by recession as an impulsive young dresser with a magpie eye for cute pieces. There were some beautiful things, notably a silk tulle mushroom-colored dress with a puffy collar that rose up around Lily Donaldson's face like a flower, and great metal wire and stone-studded belts and neckpieces. Still, the house expertise in knits was kept to a minimum in the flash of a raschel flame-knit coat lining and a matching dress, or a moss-stitch pullover paired with tailored pants. At a moment when the possibilities of knitwear are inspiring young designers, and sweater dressing is such a huge trend, the conservative-chic direction somehow submerged the sense that Missoni is a leading light in that field.</p></div>"
145,fall,2008,f2008,miu-miu,"Lace made for a fascinating fetish object at the Prada show in Milan last week. At her little-sister label, Miuccia Prada fixated on, of all things, jockey uniforms. ""I wanted to take sport in a new direction,"" she said afterward. The show began in quite literal fashion with a jumpsuit of bold, color-blocked primary silks, worn over bare legs and cone-shaped heels. Each model's initials were embroidered in leather letters above her left breast, and each wore a fitted horse hood that snapped below her chin, along with a full face of makeup.</p><p>From there, the races-to-runway uniform morphed into densely knit blouson sweaters over long shorts and duchesse-satin tunics and track jackets that topped straight skirts. In a stroke of parallelism between her two collections, Prada showed narrow, laser-cut felt shifts and dresses in graphic floral or chevron lace that offered hide-and-seek peeks of the stretch-jersey bodysuits in contrasting colors underneath. For evening, the lace became matte sequins.</p><p>Coming at the tail end of a month of shows, the sports reference seemed curiously off-subject. Maybe that's just Miuccia, always a few steps ahead. Still, all the horseplay and repetitive pursuit of concept did seem to come at the cost of real-life clothes. That impression was only partly allayed by the closing group of shapely solid-colored dresses and coats.</p></div>"
146,fall,2008,f2008,monique-lhuillier,"With Super Tuesday and the Super Bowl parade both today, optimism is thick in the city's air. Backstage at Monique Lhuillier, the designer expressed confidence about an equivalent contest for red-carpet specialists like herself: the Oscars. ""I hear the strike is almost over,"" she said. ""And we did really well at the SAGs with America Ferrera and Marcia Cross.""</p><p>That sunny outlook was also evident in Lhuillier's Fall collection, which she described as ""over-the-top."" And it was, at least to the degree that this designer will allow herself to go. Lhuillier doesn't do excess. Everything must be just right. Therefore, heavy embellishment—richly embroidered velvet and all-over cabochon-jeweled embroidery—came in clean silhouettes. Alternatively, the exaggerated ruffle on a gold cocktail dress meant no embellishment.</p><p>As for those red-carpet numbers, a sculptural organza gown was indeed OTT. One of the elegantly fluid, judiciously jeweled gowns, on the other hand, might strike just the right balance on Academy Awards night.</p></div>"
147,fall,2008,f2008,moschino,"What to make of the truck with the Moschino logo emblazoned on its side parked on the runway, the one from which the models trundled out? Creative director Rosella Jardini claimed it was simply how she delivered the goods. This season, those included a navy dress jacket complete with a chest full of medals, pins, and sequined anchor patches, as well as olive-drab outerwear with ""epaulets"" made from piles of brass buttons at the shoulders. Those cheeky military references and the runway gambit aside, this show turned out to be light on the kitsch factor that's come to be associated with the brand.</p><p>Instead, Jardini went sixties girly, from the models' curly mop tops right on down to their patent Mary Janes. She added gold sequined embroidery to ombré mohair minidresses, whipped Milan's de rigueur leopard print into trenches and short dresses with tiers of stiff ruffles, and discovered the many uses of black silk fringe. The latter turned up, among other places, on a three-button coat and on the pant legs of a V-neck jumpsuit. A lamb-fur coat with a standaway collar, a Victoriana dress with a high neck and bracelet sleeves, and a tucked-and-gathered black cocktail frock with a big bow at the waist were three good reasons Jardini should consider playing it straight more often.</p></div>"
148,fall,2008,f2008,moschino-cheap-chic,"A logo tee featuring a woman with hearts and flowers spilling out of the top of her head announced, ""I've got a lot on my mind."" From the looks of it, so does creative director Rosella Jardini. Her Moschino Cheap &amp; Chic show synthesized many of the season's early trends: Jewel tones; the new longer, narrow skirts; flared-leg pantsuits; and patchwork prints all made appearances. A black shift dress hand-painted with abstract flowers and a white tuxedo suit with black satin lapels were two of the highlights. By focusing on items and avoiding obvious themes this time around, Jardini may not have brought the news, but she did produce Milan's most grown-up diffusion collection—logo tees notwithstanding.</p></div>"
149,fall,2008,f2008,naeem-khan,"""A concentrated dose of glamour"": That was how Naeem Khan described his 26-look Fall show. He also said that it reflected the reality of his woman—i.e., the reality of a highly social, limelight-loving, international creature in endless need of sumptuous after-eight gear. On the glossy (not to say slippery) black runway, Khan began strongly with haute bohemian, vaguely Russian coats and dresses, intricately embroidered and trimmed with fox. He maintained momentum with beaded lace columns and a plum chiffon gown with chunky crystal trim. But excess took over when he opened up a treasure chest of coq feathers, marbled paillettes, pearls, gold bullion, and coins. Some of these embellishments were manageable when applied to cocktail-length dresses, but mostly they seemed to hobble the models. Khan plans to make a bigger-than-ever push for the upcoming Oscars—strike? what strike?—but it's likely to be his lighter fare, such as a flowy digitized ikat-print number, that will make the red-carpet cut.</p></div>"
150,fall,2008,f2008,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez accomplished a difficult feat: focusing on tailoring while amping up the sex appeal. In the past, he has built collections around dresses, but, he said backstage, ""Fashion is moving in so many different directions now, I want clean, pure, sexy, and solid again."" That meant double-faced jackets that skimmed the torso like a second skin, and collarless coats that fell gracefully away from the body, as well as a tuxedo that had somehow lost all traces of masculinity.</p><p>There was a softness to the collection, too. Witness a tweed day dress that was actually thick yarn woven through a base of chiffon, and for after dark, a peekaboo dress with a skirt of singed peacock feathers, or a safety-orange number with an elaborately pintucked bodice. Shots of paprika, celadon, and citrine also helped heat things up. Decoration, as always at this house, was minimal—lines of beads that arched along a straight skirt or the bottom of a coat.</p><p>Another way Rodriguez got the job done was by turning his attentions to the back: A leather shirt was cinched with arabesques of lacing that traced the shoulders, while the straps of a rather spare (at least in front) cocktail dress crisscrossed the spine several times. Rodriguez says these were designed to turn a man's head. And nothing turns on his customers more than that.</p></div>"
151,fall,2008,f2008,nathan-jenden,"Loyalty might be the one human trait that trumps all others, so the sight of Diane von Furstenberg in the front row of her right-hand man Nathan Jenden's solo show was positively heartwarming. The clothes, on the other hand, had a chilly quality. Black in shade and Edwardian in their bustled, ruffled proportions, they looked like the weeds of a New Romantic widow, an impression that was compounded by the hair and makeup. If such a notion bleats ""Eighties!"" to you, you wouldn't be far wrong. Jenden showed a pouf skirt with a sailor-collared, ruffled shirt, and a skirt and bodice (with matching mask!) laden with hardware and stones that could have been lifted from a masquerade ball at Steve Strange's Blitz. The designer was carried away by construction: Almost everything was seamed, pleated, tortured, even—to within a millimeter of its glamorous life. Artifice ruled, but Jenden's show notes talked about ""Tudor ladies at the court of a 21st-century samurai,"" so he himself clearly wasn't unaware of the tricksy, costumey connotations.</p></div>"
152,fall,2008,f2008,nicole-miller,"Nicole Miller found her Fall inspiration in the bravery and power of Joan of Arc. Other designers have made a muse of the teenage warrior in the recent past, and we've seen all sorts of interpretations of modern-day armor. But, filtered through Miller's signature prints and familiar dresses, the concept had a softness that seemed new. The show opened with a pleated silver lamé minidress over a black silk blouse, and along the way crossed off other Joan signifiers like chain mail and fleur-de-lis (both came as vivid prints); tunic dresses (color-blocked, they were the smartest and simplest looks in the collection); and relaxed blouson tops worn with leggings. Stirrup pants with horizontal stripes across the thighs seem like a stretch for the Nicole Miller client. Smartly, the designer abandoned the theme when it came to evening. A little black cocktail dress with ruffles trimming a squared-off neckline was unapologetically girly. Similarly, Miller knows that her celebrity clients—Natasha Henstridge, Cheryl Hines, and Melissa George sat side by side in the front row—shy away from gimmicks. So the trickiest thing about her red-carpet gowns was their surprising, but rather elegant, draping and asymmetry.</p></div>"
153,fall,2008,f2008,nina-ricci,"Under Olivier Theyskens' guidance, Nina Ricci is going through a metamorphosis. The label was originally a frilly lady brand, but he is steering it toward a young, hip girl with an unshowy rockster personality. To get there, Theyskens took her hand today and led her through a long trail in the woods, dressing her in clothes tinted and textured with the vegetal yellowy-greeny-brownish colors of fallen leaves or hibernating moths. ""Strange and poetic,"" he called it, ""but not dark.""</p><p>In practical terms, the whole of the first passage was about layerings of soft jackets, wispy underlayers, and an extended riff on multiple versions of a twisty-legged pant—jodhpurlike above, skinny-legged below, each shading seamlessly downward into a matching shoe-boot. If the pant never quite hit the mark (there's a general question mark hovering over ""creative"" trousers this season, and Theyskens' didn't remove it), the array of jackets and the tonal subtleties kept the eye seduced. Ocher, dull yellows, khaki, rust, and chestnut progressed into greens, plastery pinks, and dusty blues as the top layers resolved into a series of great cutaway tailcoats with rounded shoulders reminiscent of beetle wings.</p><p>Underscored by an ominous soundtrack, the cumulative effect touched another note on the scale of sub-horror-movie themes that have been playing through the collections. Finally, the chrysalis imagery broke open into dresses and strapless evening gowns, some detailed with a suggestion of vestigial wings. That put Theyskens back on familiar territory—a long way from conventional party dressing, and recognizably faithful to the sensibility he began working with as a gothy, romantic Belgian youngster at the beginning of his career.</p></div>"
154,fall,2008,f2008,ohne-titel,"Alexa Adams and Flora Gill have been paying close attention to the presidential primaries. Watching Hillary Clinton's race to be the first female to hold the highest office in the land, they got to thinking about ""how suits relate to women.""</p><p>""It's so easy to overlook the idea of what actually feels empowering and comfortable to women,"" Gill said. ""It doesn't have to be a dress.""</p><p>And the duo did deliver sophisticated, modern suits, in monochrome royal blue, camel, and red. Unfortunately, these were highly reminiscent of the ones they showed in their debut collection for Spring, and that dulled their impact somewhat. They also indulged, at times, in too much of a good thing, as with the manic head-to-toe jacquard knits. They did better with the furlike hand-knits and the print dresses, which stood out with intricate piping, smocking, and draped details. It's only natural that Adams and Gill, having just one season under their belt, are still finding their voice.</p></div>"
155,fall,2008,f2008,oscar-de-la-renta,"Recession? What recession? The Federal Reserve may have just lowered interest rates again, but Oscar de la Renta is still laying on the gold leaf. With pop chanteuse Regina Spektor at the grand piano in his 583 Park Avenue show space, the designer sent out a Fall collection of impeccable clothes for gals young and old who are accustomed to the good life. For day, de la Renta stayed true to his tested silhouettes: a long and lean jacket in boiled cashmere over full-cut flannel pants, or a boxier jacket in a cashmere knit with a knee-length dirndl skirt in dip-dyed silk. Where he experimented a bit was with a trio of high-waist silk zibeline pants, the most striking of which was in amethyst with a black net overlay, worn with a Venetian red silk ruffle-front blouse. There was plenty of fur, too—sable at the hem of a herringbone-tweed coat, fox on the collar of a sheared broadtail. And, yes, that was gold embroidery on an otherwise unassuming (by de la Renta standards) shearling.</p><p>Come evening, the collection went two ways: understated, as with a trio of black columns in velvet, hammered satin, and silk crepe; or gala. Gustav Klimt's work was a reference point not only for a strapless floral chiffon embroidered dress accessorized with several strands of beads, but also for a pair of black gowns—one in a realistic (gold-) leaf motif and the other in a more abstract brushstroke style. Boom or bust, de la Renta knows what his ladies like.</p></div>"
156,fall,2008,f2008,paul-smith,"When he was 21 years old, a little more than 40 years ago, Paul Smith went to Paris for the first time with his wife, Pauline. They soaked up the Gitanes-jazz-and-coffee-bar flavor of the city, took in a couture show or two—if I'm hearing him right—and now, all this time later, his life-changing experience has resurfaced, like a buried memory, to change his approach to womenswear. It seems that the past master of English quirk got all French existential on us this season. Think basic black in a pencil skirt or a tautly tailored coat-dress; think beat in a striped mohair top with a swingy little skirt, or a black bouclé coat paired with cigarette-legged moiré jeans.</p><p>They were such incongruous associations for Smith that it was a relief to see a woman less Juliette Gréco, more naughty secretary (or some similar dolly bird from any <em>Carry On</em> movie) in a pinstriped blouse with a pinstriped pencil skirt, or a gray topcoat with a hint of petticoat poking through its kick pleat. But there were echoes of another ambassador for fashion existentialism, Miuccia Prada, in the retro florals, with the blouse matching the stockings and the skirt matching the shoes. A combination of green bouclé jacket and orange bouclé dress also had a distinct eau de Miuccia at her bad-taste best.</p><p>Backstage, Sir Paul was revved by the couture references—something new for him—but let's face it: A sack dress is just a sack, unless it's been blessed by Cristobal Balenciaga's magic touch.</p></div>"
157,fall,2008,f2008,peter-jensen,"Many roads lead to the country this Fall, but only Peter Jensen would take the signpost that reads ""Mike Leigh's <em>Nuts in May</em>: a film about a miserable camping trip in England."" At least, that was the gist of his show notes, which were dedicated to ""Candice Marie,"" the dorky heroine of the 1976 comedy of British social embarrassment. As it turned out, you didn't have to be au fait with the plot and characters to get the clothes, because this time Jensen kept them as simple (or maybe, simplistic) as can be. There were tweed checked skirts, anoraks, waxed-cotton raincoats, and bouclé parkas worn with the occasional picture-knit (a fox head on one) and funny cotton shoulder bags (one in the shape of a donkey with dangling legs). The humor and quirkiness were mostly reserved for the accessories, like thick, heathery space-dyed walking socks and the silly but engaging hats: one a bonkers furry squashed Busby with a plastic visor, the other a poufy chef's hat, which had collapsed to one side.</p></div>"
158,fall,2008,f2008,peter-som,"Peter Som was in an eccentric mood for Fall, having found himself attracted to the ""quirky, dark, and idiosyncratic"" qualities of Diane Arbus' photographs of downtown New Yorkers. ""They're reality-based and fantasy-oriented,"" the designer explained. Much the same could be said of his collection, which ran the gamut from attractive (if a tad vintage-y) cocktail dresses, rendered in sumptuous materials like mille-feuille organza and duchesse satin, to luxurious separates. These included full skirts and slouchy Donegal tweed pants, sweater jackets and distressed tweed toppers, and Chantilly lace-sleeved print blouses—many of them worn under extravagant furs (no signs of recession chez Som).</p><p>If the collection had a bit of a grab-bag feel and occasionally found the designer treading on familiar ground, it also had plenty of desirable moments. Som knows his customer, and she's not going to be lacking a wish list. He gave his clothes a compelling touch-me quality by creating texture with beads and feathers and autumnal tweeds. His inventive palette (cerise, lemon, navy, plum) was the result of his imagining what Arbus' black-and-white photos would look like in color. The ""skewed"" skirts with layered hems and buttoned-on panels of cloth may have been too studied in their quirkiness, but a mismatched blouse-and-skirt ensemble topped with a cheetah-print coat had an irresistible <em>Grey Gardens</em>-style charm.</p></div>"
159,fall,2008,f2008,phi,"The mood was informed by Helmut Newton's <em>Sleepless Nights</em>, a now-classic tome of darkly erotic photographs published in 1978, while the construction took its lead from forties and fifties foundation garments. ""They're structured and utilitarian at the same time,"" said designer Andreas Melbostad, who experimented with lace, tulle, and stretch ""power mesh"" to give the clothes elasticity and an engineered body consciousness. Spring at Phi had been quite masculine, but Fall—save for some sharp and narrow smoking coats—was very feminine. Which is probably why the extravagant shearlings looked massive, a bit out of place. But there was a fresh, feral, ""I am woman, hear me roar"" quality to the lingerie-inspired ensembles of bustiers, bras, and lace-banded leggings layered under soft, even frilly, shirtdresses. Some elements, like the tutu skirts, got a bit costumey, but for the most part, Melbostad delivered what he'd promised in the program notes: ""the elegance of decadence.""</p></div>"
160,fall,2008,f2008,philosophy,"Leave it to an Italian to make a New York fashion week presentation feel like a party. With Alberta Ferretti's short and sweet Fall Philosophy show playing on a frequent loop, the crowd of editors and familiar social faces at the Eyebeam gallery was free to take in the wares, have a drink, and mingle at an unhurried—let's call it Mediterranean—pace. The 23-look collection revolved mostly around the juxtaposition of boyish tailored coats (these in navy wool and tweed) and girlishly sexy little dresses. ""It's a new way to coordinate the masculine and the feminine,"" explained Ferretti. ""It's the mix that's interesting."" In its many variations, Ferretti's outerwear had terrific appeal, but the lion's share of attention went to the dresses. These were in fact ingenious ensembles of separate pieces—say, a velvet apron dress worn over a sequined tulle slip. With all the black lace, there was a distinct boudoir feel, but Ferretti dispelled any sordid notions. ""My customer is open in her sensuality,"" she said. ""But I don't like the too-aggressive woman."" Sex-tape starlets, take heed.</p></div>"
161,fall,2008,f2008,pollini,"Rifat Ozbek's past is colorful enough to make you wish you'd lived it with him—and so he offers you clothes that make that a distinct possibility. In his latest collection for Pollini, he was inspired by his teenage life as a glam-rocking Central Saint Martins student in London. To a charging soundtrack of vintage Roxy Music and David Bowie, Ozbek offered his own take on the golden years of glitter (necessarily abstracted because no one has that kind of joyful innocence anymore). Was that Amanda Lear's beret we just saw? And didn't that printed culotte suit echo Ziggy Stardust? Quite frankly, if this was your era, Ozbek would have had you at the hello of an obi-wrapped coat-dress with fox-trimmed cuffs and hem. Bowie's early seventies fascination with Japanese style was mirrored in the Kansai-like stiffness of fabrics like silk brocade (cut into huge, flared ""samurai"" pants) or kimono prints used as a print on a chiffon shirt or as the trim on a tweed kimono jacket.</p><p>Ozbek wanted to convey a luxurious tone—the cuffs of a tweed coat were wreathed in huge paillettes, its neckline was swathed in flame-dyed fox, the matching boots were orange. But it was really his unholy enthusiasm for a fabulous moment in his own history that energized the presentation. And that was enough to compensate for clunkers like a sequin-bodiced cocktail dress that might have graced Angie Bowie in one of her less glittering nights down at the Sombrero. BTW, shouts out to Erickson Beamon for the jewelry.</p></div>"
162,fall,2008,f2008,ports-1961,"Tia Cibani's muse was an imaginary creature she called Lassair, which translates from Gaelic as ""Flame."" It was all about mythology, her program notes explained: ""Ports 1961 falls under the spell of a Scottish winter with its dark moods and whimsical auras that tease the subconscious mind.""</p><p>Unfortunately, the spell was so complete that Cibani failed to realize that parts of her Fall collection had been magically turned into costume by the powers of over-styling. It was difficult to conjecture where a woman could wear a bandeau dress with a large wooden buckle at the bust. And a faux-fur cloak not only read <em>Braveheart</em> but obscured what looked like a desirable slim dress underneath.</p><p>Thankfully, a few similarly of-the-moment dresses did make it into plain view, including a cable sweater version in a rich shade of green and a jacquard number that was ingeniously draped and tied in front. The pants were also well tailored (which can't be said for every runway this week). But in order to move forward, Ports 1961 needs to put less emphasis on storytelling and more on clothes that work in real life.</p></div>"
163,fall,2008,f2008,prada,"Miuccia Prada is about to do for the lace industry what Nicolas Ghesquière did for flower printers last season—send the mills into frantic overdrive. After glimpsing a piece of lace in her studio and at first ignoring it, she found the handmade fabric crept up on her, to the point where it took over almost the entire collection. ""I thought using a little bit here and there is tacky, so we've had all Switzerland working on couture lace. They're in shock,"" Prada laughed after the show. ""When you are working on something simple, the surface is important. I wanted to do minimal, something that was feminine and strong—but in the end, not so sexy. And there are a lot of references to early nineties Prada in there.""</p><p>There was something almost sinister in the cumulative effect of seeing a legion of girls advancing down a steep spiral runway in dizzying numbers of transparent outfits in black, brown, bronze, silver, and pale blue lace. After the first looks of opaque black suiting and dresses implanted with strange upstanding frills (with matching frilled patent cone-heeled shoes), the show shifted into full-lace gear. At first, it came layered over buttoned-up blue shirts, which in turn went over another nude-colored stretch shirt, creating an odd, done-up, double-collar effect. Below, the unlined A-line skirts gave a clear view of big panties—a nostalgic view, in fact, for they were one of the sly, self-referential nineties-Prada codes that were inserted here and there (fashion-history train spotters could also tick off the industrial metal clips on the bra straps).</p><p>There was an erotic force to the show that came out of the tension between covered-up shape and transparency, and an underlying, near-fetishistic darkness that steered the lace away from any sense of froufrou prettiness. Not quite goth, not quite dominatrix, it was an elusive thing to label. If it was one-note (and a bit disconcerting for fans worrying about where their winter coats and jackets are coming from), it also packed that powerful, slightly unsettling image that is, of course, the full Prada experience.</p></div>"
164,fall,2008,f2008,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Now in their second season in New York, Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton settled on a pair of very American inspirations for their Fall collection: Kurt Cobain's grunge and the Adrian Lyne romp <em>9 1/2 Weeks</em>. The two may seem strange bedfellows, but the London-based duo made a connection in—wait for it—gentlemen's dressing gowns. The Nirvana frontman, it turns out, occasionally wore a robe onstage, and Kim Basinger's character borrowed her lover Mickey Rourke's too-big-for-her overcoat.</p><p>Lily Donaldson shrugged on a great-looking oversize plaid cocoon jacket with a shearling collar to open the show. More plaids followed on blouson tops and high-waist men's trousers, a shirtdress with its hem looped up in back, and a voluminous chiffon parachute dress cinched with a narrow belt held together by a plastic bangle. Less Seattle and more Manhattan circa 1986 were a silvery satin tank and matching paper bag-waist pants, a Lurex robe coat, a long navy trench lined in paisley that matched the model's shirtwaist dress, and a hot plunge-front wrap dress.</p><p>White croc leggings and electric-blue sequin pants looked wrong. But absent those missteps, Bregazzi and Thornton have begun staking out as their own territory what once belonged solely to Stella McCartney and her special brand of laid-back cool. There's no denying the appeal of clothes with such a sexy sense of ease.</p></div>"
165,fall,2008,f2008,pringle-of-scotland,"Pringle of Scotland has so thoroughly severed itself from its roots as a classic manufacturer of argyle golfing sweaters that it's now completely unrecognizable. Under Clare Waight Keller, an ex-Gucci designer, its makeover is as an international luxury brand, but it's one that is still in search of an identity convincing enough to stand up to scrutiny on a runway. Some of the pieces that Waight Keller showed had merit, but it was hard going to pick them out. She does have a feeling for knitwear: There were a couple of intricately constructed knit dresses with tight torsos and flared skirts; trapeze-shaped cardigans and sweaters done in a chunky diagonal stitch looked modern and well made. Later in the show, a curly-haired gray shearling coat and a jacket with vaguely forties shoulder lines and embroidery on the bodice were strong, too. All in all, though, that was not enough to erase the feeling that this collection would be better seen on a rail in a showroom.</p></div>"
166,fall,2008,f2008,proenza-schouler,"A road trip to Donald Judd's Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas, inspired Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez. That and making paper airplanes en route in the car. The folds were translated into the Fall show's opening series of dresses, luscious jewel-tone shifts in silk twill that doubled and redoubled back on themselves like so many enormous ruffles. Jackets, too, were given the accordion treatment and, like the dresses, worn with contrast-color stockings and brightly hued suede pumps, or super-slouchy trousers.</p><p>Construction and the inner workings of a garment became the designers' fascination. A charcoal double-faced wool melton coat looked as if it had been put on inside out. From there they went to extremes, cutting away the back of a silk tweed jacket to expose the lining and all the seams, and piecing together a shearling as if it were a puzzle, so the shag was seen in parts—the arms, for instance—while elsewhere the wool was spliced to reveal the shiny interfacing.</p><p>This collection had gorgeous colors and enough sequined cocktail dresses for all of the duo's socialite pals, but it was by no means their easiest to grasp, and it may turn off some of their less conceptually minded customers. That's of little consequence to McCollough and Hernandez. After all the kisses and congratulations backstage, they said the best thing about having new(-ish) backers is that it allows them to make two collections: one that's commercial (for that, visit the showroom) and one that's editorial. It's not tough to guess which they prefer.</p></div>"
167,fall,2008,f2008,rachel-comey,"Guests perched on Victorian couches and mismatched chairs at the Salmagundi Art Club, in a landmark brownstone on Manhattan's Golden Mile. It was the perfect setting for Comey's quirky, print-heavy, forties-inflected collection. Print motifs on fun and wearable dresses, she said, were informed by a recent reading of a Houdini biography—one of the looks was even called Presto. ""I'm into easy,"" Comey said. And so blouses were worn under twisted, vintage-y suits with elbow or three-quarter sleeves, and accessorized with little white anklets and platforms hand-painted with book titles like <em>Séance on a Wet Afternoon</em> (which indeed it turned out to be). Quilting, intarsia knits, and fur-look baby alpaca—made from animals that died of natural causes, the program insisted!—added texture and a wink of humor. While Comey's ""off"" color schemes and mad, <em>Grey Gardens</em> mixes of print and pattern worked well, the styling was, perhaps, less than original. Still, there was charm here.</p></div>"
168,fall,2008,f2008,rachel-roy,"Georgia O'Keeffe meets <em>Cold Mountain</em> for the Park Avenue set? That would be one way to describe Rachel Roy's Fall collection. Before her show, the designer said she was interested in the intersection between Native American and Colonial styles, but brought up-to-date for the women of today. It was a tricky proposition, though for the most part Roy pulled it off. If the geometric black-on-gray jacquard used for a tulip skirt and a belted blanket cardigan that topped a tuxedo shirt came off somewhat heavy-handed, there were plenty of other pieces that finessed the conceit in a more subtle way. Take, for instance, a black wool suit with an extra-long jacket worn with a flounced white silk blouse, or a pumpkin silk sleeveless dress with a bow at the waist and a statement necklace of feathers and beads. Here Roy caught that mix of rawness and polish she was looking for.</p></div>"
169,fall,2008,f2008,rag-bone,"""We wanted it to be sharp,"" said David Neville backstage after the Rag &amp; Bone show, and sharp it was. Girly flourishes have sometimes tempted Neville and his design partner Marcus Wainwright, but they smartly cut out the frills for Fall, working off the twin inspirations of <em>Blade Runner</em> and the forties. Suits had a militaristic look, courtesy of jackets with strong shoulders and cutaway lapels, narrow ties clipped to starchy button-downs, and brass buttons with daggers on them.</p><p>Outerwear, likewise, had a regimental air, be it a charcoal greatcoat or a black toggle jacket with an imposingly chic high collar. Softening all that swagger were jersey jodhpurs or leggings, and items like a long, belted sweater worn over a little mini and tights. And Neville and Wainwright didn't abandon the dress entirely. One short black number came with a stripe of jet crystals down the front and back. Another royal-blue hourglass bustier style had a built-in mesh bodice. But the strongest, like a stark black leather shift, were unadorned. After taking a few cracks at it, they¿ve managed to figure out a way to give the feminine elements of their collection the same edge as their reliably assured tailoring.</p></div>"
170,fall,2008,f2008,ralph-lauren,"The antler chandeliers spray-painted gold were the first clue that we were in for a change of scenery. After throwing what will go down in fashion history as one of its grandest parties ever for his 40th anniversary last September, Ralph Lauren swapped Central Park for Colorado. His Western family retreat, the Double RL Ranch, has provided inspiration for many of his famous signatures, and he reprised several of them today with superb results.</p><p>Lauren opened with a series of city dresses and suits in cashmere herringbone and black double face cut close to the body. But he didn't linger long in this urban terrain (smart thing; the leopard-print pieces weren't a good fit with the rest of the collection). Soon we were heading West to the land of green border-stripe swing jackets, red-and-black buffalo plaid suits, and cozy blanket coats. He worked these Ralph-isms with customary expertise, coming up with unexpected combinations like a fitted plaid hunting jacket with a spry little mini in a buffalo check, or a cashmere plaid shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glam necklace (Lauren lined up a stunning list of jewelers for the show, including the Gem Palace) and tucked into a sassy tulle skirt covered in beads and feathers. Of course, many of these outfits will look just as at home in Manhattan as on the range.</p><p>The plaids lingered after dark—some, like a winning high-necked gown that fanned out below the knees, more successfully than others. But his evening wasn't one-note. He showed supple draped velvets, two of the prettiest in a deep hunter green and a garnet decorated with beads. And for something more dramatic, there was a black tulle gown with a cutaway back. Lauren knows that wherever his ladies take themselves, country or city, they always pack a party dress.</p></div>"
171,fall,2008,f2008,ralph-rucci,"The program notes explained that in place of the art and fashion images that usually inspire Ralph Rucci, he looked to quantum mechanics. As highfalutin as that sounds, it produced his most unfettered and modern work yet.</p><p>Quantum mechanics is the physics of waves, and an undulating motif coursed through the show—on a streamlined wool jersey day dress with decorative parallel seams traveling up the torso, say, or on a double-faced cashmere coat stitched together from concentric ovals. The concept came to its apotheosis in a tulle gown embroidered with rippling tubes of duchesse satin, a technique borrowed and adapted from the legendary Madame Grès. Other standouts included a vinyl raincoat quilted in a sunray pattern (yes, fashion's foremost fabric aesthete deigned to use vinyl) and a densely embroidered paillette dress with a horsehair underlay for shape.</p><p>But a word on Rucci's time slot: 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, the last day of a long month of collections. He moved his show to Paris, in part, so that his exquisite workmanship, and it is remarkable, could be better appreciated in the birthplace of couture. If he wants the full attention of the fashion community, he should find an open slot earlier in the schedule and grab it.</p></div>"
172,fall,2008,f2008,requiem,"For what was only their second runway show, Raffaele Borriello and Julien Desselle had an impressive array of retailers in the front row. The designers are alums of Dior, Gucci, and YSL, and as such bring more polish to their clothes than other newcomers on the schedule. But that doesn't mean they're immune to growing pains.</p><p>Moving on from last season's forties-meets-sixties theme, they cast their eyes toward Jerry Hall in her Studio 54 days. Predictable, perhaps, as an inspiration—but not necessarily unpromising. They turned out a few of the fur chubbies we've seen elsewhere in Paris, and hit on other Fall trends like ruffles (cascading down the bodice of one shift, circling the hem of another) and shine. But an oversize yellow, black, and white houndstooth looked garish, and the dirndl skirt they cut it in verged on dowdy. The couture feel they often refer to in interviews just wasn't there.</p></div>"
173,fall,2008,f2008,reyes,"It was the last days of disco on José Ramón Réyes' runway. Citing the Whit Stillman movie as a starting point, the designer devised a seventies Ivy Leaguer with her first job in New York City as his muse, providing her with enough colorful satin frocks for a week's worth of late nights at Studio 54. For day she was also given a wardrobe of double-breasted jackets, leg-elongating boot-cut pants, loden mohair coats with military detailing, and wrapped and draped matte jersey dresses.</p><p>Having launched his label as a contemporary brand in 2005, Réyes is repositioning his line at the opening designer price point this season. The urge to justify the higher price tags might explain why some of those satin dresses, many with silver-foil accents, came off as overdone. When Réyes focused on items like a boxy boyfriend blazer, a rugby-striped V-neck dress worn over a button-down shirt, or a khaki and olive color-blocked trenchcoat with a detachable fox collar, his talents for all-American sportswear, a key Fall trend, really came through.</p></div>"
174,fall,2008,f2008,richard-chai-love,"Six months ago, Richard Chai began honing his brand (logos, labels, and the like) with art director Fabien Baron. It was the ideal moment to step back and think hard about who he is as a designer. Well, judging by the Fall collection that had people buzzing, he has found himself.</p><p>""When you're starting out, you want to show everything you can do,"" Chai had said a few days before the show. ""Now I feel like I have a new confidence within myself. This is my vision."" The first look was a knockout: a tiny shearling jacket in forest green (so dark it was almost black) over a long sequined waistcoat, ivory shirt, and slouchy slim pants in a brocade with just a hint of texture. In typical Chai style, it was meticulous, incorporating his characteristic arced seams, but there was a new lightness, too. That feeling pervaded the entire collection, which flowed coherently from the masculine sexiness of pants and boots with biker jackets, and luxurious knits in woodsy colors, to the dresses his customers adore in bright bursts of color. The finale was a series of dresses in a chiffon photo print of the melted sequins that had embellished earlier pieces. It was a clever idea, though Chai somewhat spoiled the effect by applying it to a few too many looks. Still, that was a small blight on an otherwise strong effort. With a new men's collection this season as well, and concrete plans for a store by spring, this aspiring brand builder is on a roll.</p></div>"
175,fall,2008,f2008,richard-nicoll,"There's a wisdom in maintaining a certain thread of continuity between collections, especially when you're a young designer trying to impress your identity on the world. That idea must have been at the front of Richard Nicoll's mind when he followed up his Amish-organza-themed hit Spring show with more of the same: large, squared-off collars on dresses with semi-transparencies built into double-layered skirts. The clothes looked easier to wear than last season's more theoretical work, and there was no harm in showing them. The remaining question was whether Nicoll could complete the thought, or make it branch off interestingly in another direction—the sort of imaginative narrative that makes a fashion show a satisfying thing to watch.</p><p>The answer is, he didn't. The rest of the collection was a bumpy ride with scant discernable connection between looks, shapes, and intentions. Not that there weren't bits and pieces that looked strong: a couple of businesslike blazers with short skirts, a navy cashmere shawl wrapped over soft pants and a blouse, and a long midnight-blue chiffon shirtdress with a bow at the neck, to name a few. Had he just concentrated on building off those looks, the collection would've seemed far more resolved.</p></div>"
176,fall,2008,f2008,rick-owens,"Those who came looking for the light-handed couture of Spring were in for a surprise. The couture workmanship was still there, but as for the light—well, Owens hasn't retreated back to his proverbial crypt, but his models did look like they had swaggered through the apocalypse. An engaging sight it was, too. Their uniform consisted of a mink cap, a glorified cashmere sweat suit of layered tees and long shorts in olive drab or black, and leather or shearling legwarmers that laced at the back of the knee and belled out unzipped above towering wedge boots.</p><p>Having established that base, Owens zeroed in on the outerwear that he so loves to embellish. ""I lifted so directly from Lee Bontecou that I'm telling everybody,"" he said backstage, referencing the American sculptor best known for her menacing fabric and steel constructions of the sixties. Indeed, some of the coats had funnels, à la Bontecou, that protruded several inches above the shoulders like wings and circled around the torso to drape from the hips. These might prove challenging even for Owens' most avant-garde devotees, but there were other pieces that will only broaden his appeal: Take the divine, weightless-looking minks that tied dramatically at the neck to drape in soft folds down the torso, or the edgier peplum styles in (Bontecou again) patchworks of cashmere, metallic leather, and faded denim. These will surely find an eager audience at the Paris transplant's first New York outpost, a Tribeca store at Hudson and Dominick that's scheduled to open this summer.</p></div>"
177,fall,2008,f2008,roberto-cavalli,"After his romantic, soft-focus Spring collection—quite a turnaround for Roberto Cavalli—the Fall show drew plenty of curious onlookers. The setting didn't look much different: He traded in a photo backdrop of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors for one of Paris' similarly opulent Opéra Garnier. But would the clothes continue in the same prettily subdued vein, or would he go vamp on us, as was once his wont?</p><p>The answer: a little of both.</p><p>Cavalli opened and closed with fifties fit-and-flare dresses, bare at the shoulders. For day they came in white, embroidered with pastel wisteria and mimosa blossoms; after dark they were accessorized with rhinestone tiaras like those you'd see at a high-school prom or a debutante ball. In between, he went to Peru, knitting up colorful homespun sweaters, printing black cashmere jackets with vibrant roses, and embroidering both a sweet pinafore dress and a sexy bustier with paillettes in floral shapes. Black sequins at the necklines of chiffon intarsia tank dresses protected the models' modesty coming, but going was an altogether different story.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""1u835r""></div></div><p>The show didn't hold together quite like Spring had—and then there was the caveat that, despite a few, almost craftsy patchworked furs, it didn't feel like a Fall collection. Not that the Cavalli faithful will much mind. They have the financial wherewithal to winter somewhere warm, and, once there, a black broderie anglaise dress—the show's loveliest look—will suit them just fine.</p></div>"
178,fall,2008,f2008,rodarte,"Some designers have more bark than bite. But with their dramatic Fall collection, Kate and Laura Mulleavy proved they have plenty of teeth. And sharp ones.</p><p>It was, said Kate, ""a continuation of something that started last season."" Japan was again the starting point of the sisters' journey, but the happy, shiny, pastel-colored, and manga-inflected confections of Spring gave way to ""slasher"" dresses in black, white, and bloodred. The Mulleavys turned their imaginations loose on ""the connection between the Kabuki tradition and that of modern Japanese horror films."" Yes, the gothic knitwear had a torn-web quality, and the torturous, sadomachistic shoes (a reworking of last season's) wrung winces from the audience, but the show was bigger than just that, more ambitious. String sculptures by the German-American artist Eva Hesse gave birth to the shaggy pieces with a primitive rag-doll look. Romantic, full-skirted cocktail numbers looked like they could have been painted by the Impressionist Edgar Degas.</p><p>The sisters—who have a successful Gap collaboration under their belt—are gradually increasing the percentage of daywear in their collections. For Fall there were tailored coats and zip-pocket pants and even (sheer and lustrous) oxford blouses. This is a smart move, not just because it will broaden their retail reach, but because occasions to wear wispy party dresses don't come along every day. But then again, neither does the Mulleavys' extraordinary talent.</p></div>"
179,fall,2008,f2008,rodnik,"""It's the first time a brand became a band onstage,"" enthused Philip Colbert about Rodnik's show, where models weaved around Colbert (on vocals), Richard Ascott (on drums), and aide-de-camp Lily Evans (giving go-go support). In truth, things got pretty shambolic as they squalled their way through three songs (including ""Firebird,"" which comes with its own ""choreography"").</p><p>Of course, any criticism—either of performance or clothes—had been preempted by Colbert's declaration that ""amateur is not a dirty word."" And yet it was confounding to see how far the Rodnik twosome have taken their self-mythologizing gall. Their faces—as interpreted by the artist Hugo Guinness—made up a boldly graphic print with the parasols and top hats that have been personal style signatures. The same faces adorned all the buttons (even the tiny red ones hidden in the cuffed three-quarter sleeve of a black dress).</p><p>After parting company with their design staff, Ascott and Colbert took a hands-on approach with this collection. Given that neither has a jot of formal design training, it was wise of them to stick to the simplest silhouettes: a T-shirt dress, a shift, a jacket dress with a slightly dropped waist. A collaboration with famed bespoke shirtmaker Emma Willis yielded a tuxedo-fronted, French-cuffed little black dress (though its synthetic hand somewhat undercut the item's visual appeal). That's the kind of strategic alliance that has characterized Rodnik's rise. Will it last? Well, they claim to value chic as much as amateurism, which means that at some point they'll surely have to test their rock band/brand in a more demanding arena.</p></div>"
180,fall,2008,f2008,roksanda,"Roksanda Ilincic escaped to Brasília at Christmas, and she returned with a memory full of Oscar Niemeyer's extraordinary architectural shapes, vistas of waterfalls, and brilliant flashes of tropical color. ""When I came back, my collection became more sculptural,"" Ilincic said. ""I wanted to contrast soft with hard, and put in those splashes of green, pink, and orange you see in Brazil."" The arcing shapes came through in soaring shoulders and the faceted standout panels that jutted from the hips or contained color-blocked zones of satin in bodices; the flashes of neon were in contrasting sashes, or a pouf of bright ostrich feather. One head-turner was Ilincic's first fur, a dyed silver fox with vast, upspringing poufs on the shoulder, tied in the middle with a succulent pink satin belt. Still, although Ilincic is smart to experiment with new kinds of structure, her technique remains a work in progress. As it turned out, the dresses she had most control over were her looping, fluid togas, pieces whipped up with a spontaneous freehand ease that, in one case—a length of orange charmeuse satin tethered with a pink ribbon—looked stunning.</p></div>"
181,fall,2008,f2008,rue-du-mail,"Now in its third season, Martine Sitbon's Rue du Mail is shaping up as a dress and coat label. With beetles (yes, insects, not the band) as her starting point for Fall, the light, flyaway feeling of the designer's Spring collection was replaced by a more structured yet voluminous look—one that jibed with several other directional Paris shows. True to the stated inspiration, duchesse satin toppers had carapacelike backs—Sitbon described them backstage as ""protective shells."" Other coats were narrow through the torso, then bubbled below the waist and from elbow to wrist. Similarly, silk sack dresses came quilted in interesting curvilinear patterns, while crinkled patent-leather frocks kept to the theme with their rigid silhouettes.</p><p>Beyond shape, it was the insect's iridescence that turned Sitbon on. Her colors ranged from deep peacock green and eggplant to what she called ""neon darks."" These appeared on handkerchief silk dresses in abstract wing prints, a motif that she also worked into embroideries of paillettes and patent leather. With no pants and few tops and skirts for diversity, the show became repetitive. But Sitbon has a knack for a special dress, as her front-row fans Sofia Coppola and Emmanuelle Seigner are well aware, and it shouldn't, uh, bug anyone if she chooses to concentrate on her strengths.</p></div>"
182,fall,2008,f2008,ruffian,"Brian Wolk and Claude Morais have closed the book on Madame de Pompadour, their Spring muse. For Fall, they said their inspiration was boarding-school girls with serious rebellious streaks. Yes, they still did ruffles: You can't have a Ruffian show without them. But any frills were tempered by biker-boy belt buckles, graffiti prints, and lots of curve-hugging Japanese denim, designed in collaboration with Earnest Sewn. And that's not to mention the ultraviolet lipstick or killer sandals made by Christian Louboutin.</p><p>Reinterpretations of prep-school uniforms—the schoolgirl dress, the fitted jacket worn over a white oxford with a narrow tie, the oversize boyfriend blazer—go with this territory, of course. It was the designers' clever take on off-campus attire that stood out: a Baja jacket in French bouclé that topped a black mini, shirtwaist dresses in a print from a 1939 <em>Vogue</em> listing of boarding schools, and a bustier minidress with you've-got-to-see-it-to-believe-it graffiti needlepoint circling the waist. In sum, this was Ruffian's most youthful and imaginative collection to date.</p></div>"
183,fall,2008,f2008,saint-laurent,"They looked like an army of futuristic female automata, marching out in identical black-bowl wigs and black lipstick, some with their eyes blanked out by narrow slivers of wraparound sunglasses. The clothes they wore were equally uncompromising: stark planes of tweed, felt, and flocked fabric, precision-sliced into geometric angles and unfamiliar volumes.</p><p>It made one of the season's most joltingly dramatic contributions to the current dialogues about tailoring and austerity. If there were elements of the eighties or Italian futurism in there—like the banana-shaped high-waist pants or the curviform layers of scroll-like volumes in skirts—it wasn't Stefano Pilati's intention to be referential. ""I just wanted it to be about cut, about looking at the clothes,"" he said. ""I don't think you want to go out advertising a brand anymore. You just want to feel proud walking down the street.""</p><p>That reductionism certainly had the force of conviction about it, and it threw up some fine pieces, like jackets with swaggering, flying tails and small-waisted dresses with geometric stand-out skirts. Something about the carapace stiffness of these garments, the sense that the clothes are molded rather than fitted, puts Pilati in line with other designers, like Nicolas Ghesquière, who are pushing fashion away from the body and toward something new. In Pilati's case, the impact—with its almost complete abnegation of romanticism and traditional femininity—was a shock. Still, fashion sorely needs those who dare, and this is a collection whose controversial content and implications will be discussed and dissected for months to come.</p></div>"
184,fall,2008,f2008,sari-gueron,"""I love fancy for evening and very casual for day. In one collection, it felt strange,"" Gueron told Style.com, explaining why she's dividing her creative attentions, freeing her original label from the restraints of daywear, and launching a new contemporary line this season, called<br/>simply Sari.</p><p>Fall at the original Sari Gueron, therefore, was all about a return to the cocktail looks with which she first made her name. And it was her most luxurious effort yet. Working with yards of delicate lace and tulle and buttery leather, and amping up the embellishment, Gueron was in experimental mode. That's just where a young designer with a fledgling business should be, and some pieces did successfully push into untrod territory. A lovely abstract Japanese floral cut into a tunic, a flowy asymmetrical dress, and drop-waist frocks with flat, tiered ruffles were the expression of what Gueron calls ""the bohemian me."" Lace cardigans and a tulle skirt embroidered with thin strips of leather had a gossamer touch.</p><p>Other looks, though, were heavy, like a black leather collarless coat and full skirt, and an overwrought ruffled opera coat. Even the many iterations of the drop-waist ruffles began to feel a bit much. When it came to gowns, an unfussy ivory-and-black floral tank worn over a tiered evening skirt was an easy winner over dresses with excessive fabric weighing them down.</p></div>"
185,fall,2008,f2008,shipley-halmos,"Citing Hitchcock films like <em>Rear Window</em> and <em>Rope</em> as inspirations, the former Trovata designers Sam Shipley and Jeff Halmos sent out 14 looks that, by striking a balance between surface conservatism and winking sexuality, captured one of the key emerging moods of the season. Even better, they did it at a price that won't break the bank. There were shades of Tippi Hedren in a sharp black leather bomber, checked shirt, and slim pencil skirt, and in a yellow sheath topped by a belted cardigan—but it wasn't done too literally. ""We want to design clothes that are comfortable in our time frame,"" said Halmos. There should be no shortage of contemporary heroines lining up for a cashmere tuxedo suit or the brushed wool tank dress with silk faille pleating at the neckline.</p></div>"
186,fall,2008,f2008,sinha-stanic,"Sinha-Stanic's Aleksandar Stanic and Fiona Sinha somehow managed to pack both a few good moments and a couple of you've-got-to-be-kidding bloopers into a small collection that, according to their notes, was inspired by the cult TV show <em>Freaks and Geeks</em>. The strong points were the great cutaway shearling-collared rock 'n' roll ""high school"" jackets in padded dogtooth tweed and some loopy punkish sweaters that went off in the same direction as Rodarte's art-house knits, but in a more wearable way. Otherwise, there were coats half-smothered in shearling that steered too close to Prada's collection of a year ago to look very original, several routine cropped biker jackets, and some commercial body-hugging knit layerings that could've stayed in the back. Most memorable, however, were the bubble dresses with skirts that bore a distracting resemblance to a series of deflated leather poufs. Mystifying.</p></div>"
187,fall,2008,f2008,sonia-rykiel,"This year's 40th anniversary gave Sonia Rykiel; her daughter, Nathalie; and their newly appointed creative director, Gabrielle Greiss, license to raid the archives. There were striped sweaters, dolly-bird minidresses, and, of course, much joie de vivre—evident in color-blocked leather wedges and platforms, in striped tights, in rhinestone-dashed bags and hats, and in the honest-to-goodness smiles from the models. Believe it or not, one or two of the girls even skipped down the runway. How did Madame Rykiel manage that?</p><p>The trapeze was the dominant silhouette. The design trio used it for the colorful intarsia sweaters that opened the show and for double-breasted short coat-dresses in ivory or violet cashmere, as well as for floor-sweeping silk tent dresses in cheeky photo prints. None of this broke new ground—and no one expects that of this house—but the collection did make the most of the ways in which Rykiel's signatures intersect with Fall trends, like volume play and sweater dressing. A three-piece shorts suit was cut closer to the body, as were other tailored pieces, some embroidered with candy-colored plastic discs. Not exactly what you'd call office-appropriate, but that's never been what Rykiel is about.</p><p>She's famous, for one thing, for her feel-good finales. This time, in honor of her 1968 beginnings, she played the Beatles' ""Revolution"" and the girls came out with strass-encrusted minidresses or T-shirts and briefs, a few of them done up in the likeness of the flame-haired designer herself. Rykiel's face has entered the pop culture lexicon, and that's nothing if not a testament to her success.</p></div>"
188,fall,2008,f2008,sophia-kokosalaki,"The image of a forceful, slightly sinister form of womanhood is becoming insuppressible this season. Why? ""It's the superwoman, really,"" said Sophia Kokosalaki after sending out her collection of shape-enhancing body dresses and dramatically sculptured lace silhouettes. ""I've been inspired by fantastic art—sort of comic book, heavy metal illustrations. I thought, 'They're kind of cool, if only they had more taste!' ""</p><p>Kokosalaki's curvaceous matte-black dresses, cut with minute jigsaw details in the bust and sinuous straps wound around the neck and back, gave an erotic counterpoint of her own to one of the leading themes that are emerging now. She also dealt with sheer-opaque lace and organza in black dresses with intricate curliform cutouts and transparent 3-D sleeves twisted into the shape of stylized waves. It's a kind of dressmaking Kokosalaki has been perfecting for ages—one that always weaves in a consciousness of her Greek roots, visible in the minute macramé inserts she uses, or, more obviously, the lyre motif placed in the neckline of the long, sinuous gown in her finale. As a practical girl, she always gives thought, too, to something to wear for day—a couple of dark green slicker macs were good—but it's the evolution of Kokosalaki's elegant but non-chichi vision of how to dress for evening that marks her out as a talent.</p></div>"
189,fall,2008,f2008,strk,"After seeing a photograph of the strikingly kohl-eyed abstract expressionist sculptor Louise Nevelson, Camilla Stærk was intrigued enough to immerse herself in the groundbreaking artist's work. ""I can't believe I didn't know who she was. She's so up my alley,"" said the designer backstage. Indeed she is, and perhaps that's why Stærk's Fall collection, called Black Bride of the Moon, came together so beautifully, intertwining the twin darknesses of her own vaguely perverse, modern vision with Nevelson's angular and textural ""assemblages."" The artist's sculpture <em>Spike</em> was echoed in the straps of a leather pinafore, the belt on a harem jumpsuit, and a repetition print seen on a chiffon blouse and a body-hugging skirt. Stærk added texture to her scooped, layered tank dresses in black jersey, wrapping one with strips of thin black leather, cutting another in a smoky geometric lace, and even one in fringed black leather. She delved for the first time into knits, toughening everyday merino with leather, rubber, and metal yarns, and broke more new ground with eveningwear in lace and elegant coated silk. This was easily Stærk's most polished and coherent effort to date. It should help lift her from under the radar into the mainstream of young New York talents, where she belongs.</p></div>"
190,fall,2008,f2008,stella-mccartney,"Is felt sexy? After taking in Stella McCartney's engaging show, it's clear that, yes, in the right hands, it can be. McCartney, who has made the intersection of seduction and sporty ease her stomping ground, didn't reinvent herself this season, but she did turn out what we've come to think of as Stella-isms—the sweater dress, the swing coat, the inventive alternatives to fur—in new cozy-chic incarnations.</p><p>She looked to her British heritage for her Fall motifs. Heraldic flags decorated long, off-the-shoulder knit dresses and oversize scarves; traditional broderie anglaise graced softly unstructured poet blouses and dressing gowns. If, at a time when tailoring has moved to the fore, McCartney's collection was a little light on the sharp Savile Row suiting that launched her career, well, tailoring's just not where her head is at.</p><p>The designer dedicated her show to her family and ""to everyone who believes you do not need fur in fashion."" While you won't find a lot of those in her front row, they're out there, and McCartney offered some viable stand-ins for this season's omnipresent fur chubby: a pair of oversize washed-mohair sweaters, worn with short chiffon skirts. As for that aforementioned felt, the mottled gray coats, with their big volumes cinched by faux-leather belts, scored points for making something so stiff look so cool.</p></div>"
191,fall,2008,f2008,stephen-burrows,"At an intimate presentation in his Garment District studio, Stephen Burrows confined himself to 21 looks, several of them shearlings from his debut line for Mo Lajé. Those outerwear pieces aside, he zeroed in on the jersey and satin dresses for which he's long been known, keeping the palette simple—monochrome or color-blocked wine red, sage green, slate gray, and black—and the silhouettes streamlined.</p><p>Anna Cleveland, Pat's model daughter, got to wear the choice looks, including a mock turtleneck dress with slightly padded shoulders that was both soft and tough at once. The standout evening numbers were a keyhole-neck black satin gown with a low-on-the-waist beaded sash, and a one-shoulder brown satin goddess dress. As for those shearlings—the best of which was a collarless cropped jacket in silver leaf—they looked tailor-made for his minimal frocks.</p></div>"
192,fall,2008,f2008,sue-stemp,"You don't need to read her blog to know that Sue Stemp loves a night out. Although dressing friends like Theodora Richards, Leigh Lezark, Daisy Lowe, and Sarah Sophie Flicker for a party-cum-presentation at private club Norwood was hardly the most efficient way to show a collection, it was undeniably logical for Stemp's perennially fête-inspired wares. Taking cues from the Art Nouveau decor of Maxim's, as well as some of its more decadently stylish past denizens, the designer showed flirty, jewel-toned cocktail frocks in ruched chiffon and draped satin, and maxidresses with attached scarves and Ben Copperwheat prints. It could have been the models' sweating-all-night-on-the-dance-floor hair, but Stemp seemed to hit the mark for a wardrobe that stays chic from sunset to sunrise and, in the case of her good-time girls, perhaps even longer.</p></div>"
193,fall,2008,f2008,tao,"The charm-laden froth—the fluff, spirals, and romantic drapes—that Tao Kurihara has made her signature were well represented today. The show opened with a silver-foil sack dress ruffled at the neckline and embroidered with a daisy chain of black ribbon. But, sweetly playful mood established, Kurihara did change tack slightly. Layering on the sinister, she built her twisting, voluminous silhouettes with black-and-gray boleros, drippy with loose, metallic Lurex threads. Black lipstick and ribbed-knit turtlenecks, and dresses with sleeves that inched past the tips of slender fingers, added to the collection's at times witchy spell.</p><p>Still, in the end, sweet won out. Kurihara wove candy colors into the picture, tying a fuzzy aqua cape over a turquoise jacket and coordinating plaid balloon shorts, and layering violet or shocking-pink cardigans over T-shirts and knit bloomers. And those black lips were matched by girl-power scribbles (""Be aware,"" ""Be powerful"") below the models' eyes. Together, it added up to a poetic and idiosyncratic take on the sweater-dressing trend, as well as on the season's artful, statement outerwear. That the designer could've gotten her messages across in fewer looks and at a less stately pace is but a quibble.</p></div>"
194,fall,2008,f2008,temperley-london,"""I'm moving on from pretty and becoming stronger and sexier!"" Alice Temperley announced mid-gush about the outrageous glamour of her new muse, the seductress-spy Mata Hari.</p><p>It was quite a declaration from a designer who has built her house on a lace-and-bugle-bead foundation of flirty tea frocks and party confections. But she kept her word—mostly—on the runway. Here, for a change, was black leather, cut into a provocative pencil skirt and hot-to-trot thigh-high boots; here were sharp, smart soldier jackets. Even the evening gowns had taken on a decidedly harder edge (although, it must be said, a metallic green number was too tooth-grindingly aggressive). The designer did take care of her international coterie of Temperlettes, however, cleverly doling out, between the darker fare, the needed pretty fix: intarsia sweater dresses, sunbursts, and a breezy, ruffled cream dress that only required a change of shoes to be all sweetness and light.</p></div>"
195,fall,2008,f2008,thakoon,"In light of Thakoon Panichgul's stated aim, to pit elegance against punk deconstruction, the show's opening track added a nice dose of irony to the proceedings: LCD Soundsystem's catchy-snide first hit, ""Losing My Edge"" (""I'm losing my edge/To better-looking people with better ideas and more talent/And they're actually really, really nice"").</p><p>""I want to apply aggressive elements on soft, refined silhouettes,"" Panichgul said. The aggro was expressed with tailored felt Mao jackets, a graffiti print, zipper-tooth trimmings, and a ""breakaway dress"" composed of pieces of fuchsia wool shaped like shards of broken glass floating on a sheer underlay. But Panichgul would clearly rather make love than war. The show's standouts were definitely on the tender side: quilted floral coats and languorous thirties-style dresses that recalled the English-romantic costumes of <em>Atonement</em>.</p><p>Although there were some rough patches (the pattern-mixing seemed forced, and there were some gimmicky flourishes), overall this was a pretty effort. Fall was like a good girl who really wishes she could go bad and look messed up for a change, but just doesn't have it in her to look anything but nice.</p></div>"
196,fall,2008,f2008,threeasfour,"“Sleek” and “elegant” aren't words you automatically associate with Threeasfour. “Avant-garde” and “experimental” are more like it. But without letting go of their signature swirling cut and construction, Gabi, Adi, and Ange have indeed reached a new level of refinement. It came through in a striking metallic gray wool cape with folds and tucks that curved like the inside of an abalone shell. You could see it in a cobalt silk blouson and a tweedy pencil skirt that would've qualified as prim but for a cowrie shell-shaped flourish at the hem. And it must mean something that the show opened with a black wool tuxedo jacket that oozed not eccentricity but polish.</p><p>Among the 22 looks was a wardrobe of shoulder-baring cocktail dresses, each draped differently with the hem looped up to the waist or the straps—all of them fluttering, three-dimensional beauties. Should the Oscar show go on, a teal gown made of spiraling tendrils of silk would make an inspired red-carpet choice.</p></div>"
197,fall,2008,f2008,todd-lynn,"Todd Lynn, London's slick cutter of rock 'n' roll tailoring, is upping his game by steady increments. Pants and jackets are his thing, but he's gradually working into a groove that's not so strictly androgynous. It includes leg-lengthening, high-waisted wider-leg pants and now his first dresses, one derived from a jacket that morphs into a fluid skirt, another a form-molding silhouette fitted to the knee. The standout was a glazed black raffia hourglass halter with an integral shearling bolero and a fierce goat-hair fringe at the shoulder. Polished and painstakingly precise, it's a look that stalks the line between edgy attitude and the confidence of luxury.</p></div>"
198,fall,2008,f2008,tommy-hilfiger,"""It feels iconic,"" said Tommy Hilfiger of showing at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall. Then he flashed a grin at the mention of his recent pop-culture tome celebrating Americana—a subject fetishized in every collection he's ever designed. Once upon a time that meant hoodies and jeans. Now, in the third season since the brand was remade, it means real—as in self-consciously grown-up—clothes. For Fall, Hilfiger made the sixties- and seventies-era photographs of Sam Haskins his guiding light for their ""pure, clean, and understated look."" Those references were evident very literally on the runway. Princess coats, sheath dresses, and tunic tops over wide trousers recalled the boomer years a bit too readily and, red-white-and-blue palette notwithstanding, were bloodlessly executed. There were moments of sexiness: for example, a body-hugging knit dress and a mixed-pattern ensemble of a plaid bow blouse and polka-dot skirt that had a frisson of youthful energy. But on the whole, this seemed to be a collection skewed to a much older customer than this label used to aim for. It would be too bad if, in the process of luxe-ing up his line, Hilfiger took all the fun out of his fashion game.</p></div>"
199,fall,2008,f2008,topshop-unique,"News for everyone who is taking one look at the dollar-pound exchange rate and thinking better of flying to London for a shopping spree: Topshop is on its way to New York. The hip British high-street phenomenon is slated to open its first U.S. flagship on Broadway in October, a piece of info that sheds new relevance on its Fall runway show. What's on offer is the Unique collection—a creative outlet for a lively in-house team that normally spends its days worrying about jeans and T-shirts. This season, it seems, they're getting serious, or at least more grown-up than usual.</p><p>For all the skintight black leather leggings that were used as a kind of foundation piece under roomy square-cut parkas and over-the-head tweed dresses, the collection seemed pitched more at a level-headed thirtysomething than a hell-raising teen. It included a greatcoat, shirts and pants in a vaguely militaristic brown, giant Peruvian-knit hooded ponchos, and an evening section of beige and dusty blue patchworked, printed chiffon dresses that owed something to the unmissable London influence that is Christopher Kane. So far, so sober—but a bit misleading, too. Unique is just one of the plates Topshop has spinning at any one time (more of a side plate, actually). The more famous things Topshop dishes up are Kate Moss' line, the collections created for the store by young designers (currently Jonathan Saunders, Louise Goldin, Todd Lynn, Marios Schwab, and Kane himself), and its multifarious fast-fashion ranges. By the time all that's mixed and merchandised, the Broadway store won't look much like this show, but that's OK.</p><p>Those who came to watch were there as much to applaud Topshop's philanthropic underwriting of London's New Generation scheme, without which the city's show-week energy would shudder to a halt—and to get a first look at the show venue, which the store hands over to young designers for the duration.</p></div>"
200,fall,2008,f2008,tory-burch,"The Tory Burch presentation was held at Christie's auction house, and if the outfits had been lots, there would have been bidding wars. Burch, who has developed an unusually strong brand in just four years, demonstrated once again why thousands of women are hooked on her classics. She organized her ""ladylike, but eccentric and quirky"" Fall collection in three groupings, representing ""one woman going through three different moods, exploring three different aspects of her style."" The first group was tweedy and Hitchcockian, featuring metallic jacquards and a birds-on-a-wire print. The second had something of a maritime flavor, with the spotlight on an ivory dress with silver spangles, a navy dress with cable-knit sleeves, and sailor-striped tops. The third was all about Joni Mitchell: peacock-feather and beetle prints, psychedelic florals, fringed bags. What is it that made the eclectic threads hang together…and that makes Burch a hit? The clothes are polished, but she still has fun.</p></div>"
201,fall,2008,f2008,tracy-reese,"According to Tracy Reese, her clientele ranges from 16-year-olds to 60-plus-year-olds. The unifying factor? ""They're women who aren't afraid to be noticed,"" said the designer backstage. That's a good thing considering her Fall show, in which she showed no fear in tossing together sequined florals with, say, an animal print and paisley wool in a single look—occasionally to overdone effect.</p><p>Reese loves a woman's waist, and here she played with moving it up in chic, high-waisted, wide-leg trousers, then down in twenties-inspired drop-waist skirts. The designer took inspiration from the earth's elements, which played out in bold prints influenced by stormy waves and blown-up photo prints of grass and roses. Amid the textural array, the simplicity of a lean oatmeal sweater coat provided a moment to catch your breath, because even a girl who likes to get noticed needs a day off.</p></div>"
202,fall,2008,f2008,tse,"Ghost Army, the title of TSE's Fall collection, refers to the unusual top-secret military unit founded during World War II. Counting the likes of Bill Blass and Ellsworth Kelly among their ranks, these troops used artistry, props (inflatable tanks, for example), and sound effects to distract the Germans' attention from the movements of the combat battalions.</p><p>Ironically, there was more than one ghost in the room, as Tess Giberson, who designed the clothes, left the company shortly before fashion week. The collection was shown in presentation format, and there were no signs but that it had been well thought out and created with care. Fur was introduced for the first time in the form of alpaca, and was used on its own or with knitwear. An abstract camouflage print was the most obvious nod to the theme. The military-style toppers relate not only to the current season, but are also in keeping with what Giberson developed over her time at TSE.</p></div>"
203,fall,2008,f2008,tuleh,"The presidential election has Bryan Bradley all jazzed up. On the Tuleh soundtrack, Bobby Kennedy could be heard encouraging love, wisdom, and compassion for one another, and backstage the designer had two words for reporters asking for comments about inspiration: Barack Obama. There's no doubt the campaign trail would look a lot more interesting if our lone female candidate and her peers' significant others donned Bradley's version of a power suit: a lilac jacket, a purple silk shirt, and violet velvet trousers, finished off with a loud gold chain necklace. Or how about a petticoated bustier dress in a lush fern print for the Inaugural Ball?</p><p>It'll probably never happen, but just knowing that we have options on Super Tuesday is what Bradley's so excited about. Aptly, his Fall lineup was wide-ranging. There were nipped-waist coat-dresses that flared to the knee; prim-and-proper first lady suits à la Jackie; fitted sweaters worn with long, full skirts; and a trio of <em>robes de chambre</em>, each with a rich lamé glint. An abstract-print pink and brown chiffon dress topped by a tangerine vest made from what looked like tapestry fabric put the spotlight on the designer's keen sense of color. Not every look here was a vote-getter, but it was hard not to get behind Bradley's newfound enthusiasm.</p></div>"
204,fall,2008,f2008,undercover,"Jun Takahashi took on America in his Fall collection. At least that was part of his scope, which, he said, involved a self-interrogation about the meaning of fashion standards, from men's tailoring to parkas, cargo pants, sweats, and rugged outdoor wear. Each of Takahashi's ten themes appeared as a tableau mounted on a turning dais, modeled by girls with latex-covered cone beehives.</p><p>Scene by scene, the show evolved into a gentle dialogue about hybridization that contributed some of the season's best thoughts about casual street wear (which is, let's face it, a much-neglected area in most designers' books). Takahashi's strongest pieces inserted a sense of alternative Japanese cool into sweatshirting (an indigo-dyed curvilinear top, a pullover dress made from a gray hoodie top half and a khaki camping skirt) and some brilliant amalgams of nylon down padding and ""hunter"" oiled-cotton jackets. Parkas came recast in drapey viscose, and motorcycle pants were zippered collages of leather, knit, waxed cotton, and buckles that could give Dsquared² a run for its money. Best, though, were the pieces that pushed the avant-garde Undercover ethos furthest—a spiky, tufted knit cardigan that gave a fierce spin on the season's ubiquitous chubby, and a belted biker coat implanted with fox-fur sleeves.</p></div>"
205,fall,2008,f2008,united-bamboo,"Over the past year, Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki's explorations of architecture and origami have been quite literal-minded, replete with references to geodesic domes and Herzog and de Meuron. The result was Fall 2007 and Spring 2008 collections that were somewhat heavy-handed, somewhat predictable. Well, third time's the charm: This season, their more abstracted construction gestures—as in the opening look, a black coat with a folded, beaded collar, or the cerulean jacket with 3-D prism pockets—kept the proceedings more light-handed and interesting. The appropriately upbeat music was put together by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who sat front-row with band member Nick Zinner.</p><p>United Bamboo is known for blending slightly twisted takes on preppy classics with kawaii elements. Cute returned for autumn with a leitmotif of bows, which popped up in different forms throughout the show. If some experiments with industrial materials (like a sequined dress with an overlay of cord and metallic tubes) fell flat, a series of ladylike blouses paired with paper bag-waist pants and skirts lifted the duo to higher ground.</p></div>"
206,fall,2008,f2008,valentino,"As the cliché goes, Alessandra Facchinetti has big shoes to fill at Valentino. Today she slipped into them with the tact and sensitivity of a young Italian who appreciates the storied heritage of the house, but is quietly resolved to say something to a new generation. ""I think the things Valentino created were timeless,"" she said. ""I wanted to take something from the cleanliness of the sixties structure, but at the same time make things soft and light. But there is nothing too obvious.""</p><p>In modernizing the Valentino standards, the day suit, the coat, the frothy blouse, the delicate dress, and the red gown are just a few of Facchinetti's challenges. In this first outing, appropriately low-key and staged on a small runway, she managed to demonstrate enough of a flair for fragility, precision, and pristine finish to make sense of them. Most importantly, though, she quietly cut through the potential for twee to show how a modern girl might wear Valentino today. The show began with a pale beige-tinted cashmere suit with a stand-up collar and a skirt gathered into deep folds in front, followed by an off-white chiffon sleeveless dress with a belled, multilayered feathery skirt, belted with an enameled metal bow. That struck a sound note—respectful, but not too sweet—that followed through in Facchinetti's handling of chiffon blouses with petaled necklines, vertically pleated dresses inset with abstract garlands of 3-D flowers, and two pleated georgette dresses that captured something essential about the romantic, drifty fantasy of a Valentino woman's lifestyle.</p><p>At the end, Facchinetti had the courage to put out two red chiffon dresses that, if pretty, fell some way short of the traditional Val showstoppers. Still, she had her own moment of head-turning excellence. It came when she put an immaculately cut black coat with a beautiful uprising scroll of a flounce in the back over a fluttery pink chiffon dress. That was the number that had women chattering as they left the room—proof enough that Facchinetti had survived her baptism by fire.</p></div>"
207,fall,2008,f2008,vera-wang,"In past seasons Vera Wang has voyaged back in time to czarist Russia or ancient Rome, with the result that her collections sometimes appeared too much like costume. But for Fall she took her color cue from the modernist painter Kees van Dongen, and her strongest influence, believe it or not, was the street.</p><p>There was a hipper edge to her layered silhouettes. It came across most clearly in youthful-looking sleeveless peplum tops in techno brocade or pleated ottoman, worn with tapering satin leggings. The sculptural bed jackets in quilted faille were equally cool. This isn't to say Wang has abandoned the luxe she loves: We saw more of the burnished bullion embroidery and the crystal and jet jewelry, including knockout cuffs by Philip Crangi, that she's used in previous seasons. Her latest obsession, though, is manipulating fabrics. She worked organza and felt into lavish florets—spiraling around the waist or perched on the shoulder—and grand ruffles cascaded down the front of a kimono jacket (note: an early Fall trend). As emphasized by the huge mirrors at the top of the runway, a great deal of the focus here was on the back of the garments. Take, for instance, an embroidered top with a tutu train, or a broadtail and fox jacket with a bustle. Wang is a designer who finesses every tiny detail, and this time, there wasn't a single stitch out of place.</p></div>"
208,fall,2008,f2008,vera-wang-lavender-label,"The cozy, old-world atmosphere of Bobo, a town house restaurant in the West Village, was a fitting setting for Vera Wang's first-ever runway show for her lower-priced Lavender Label collection. There was more than a hint of the fifties and sixties in a nubby tweed skirtsuit with a fur shawl collar, a satin-front/knit-back skimmy belted sheath, and a cable-knit cardigan that topped a brocade blouse and a narrow three-quarter-length skirt. Antique pearl necklaces, gamine berets, and long braids added to the classic, almost retro mood of the clothes, which—if not bursting with new ideas—were appealing and pretty. The most modern-looking pieces took cues from the designer's signature collection. A long silk dress with a panel of net and paillettes down its front is a Wang trademark, as is the soft, togalike appeal of a gathered-waist gown that dipped low in the back to reveal a sexy swath of shoulder.</p></div>"
209,fall,2008,f2008,veronique-branquinho,"After a dress-heavy tenth-anniversary Spring show, Veronique Branquinho narrowed her sights on tailoring. She placed the emphasis for Fall on a strong, built-up shoulder, in which you could see references to her fellow Belgian Martin Margiela, if you were looking. What made her jackets and coats her own were their touchable fabrics—gray flannel, astrakhan-imprinted rabbit fur, and plaid mohair—not to mention her penchant for layering their matching straight and A-line skirts over skinny faux-leather leggings. Branquinho likes to play the buttoned-up against the edgy.</p><p>That came across in a number of sleeveless, V-neck, drop-waist nylon dresses. Worn over slim turtlenecks, they had something of the school uniform about them, save for the artful patchworks of fabrics built into their accordion-pleated skirts. Jersey shifts color-blocked in heather gray and black, and lace frocks in copper or emerald green rounded out an understated collection. Branquinho didn't add much to this season's fashion conversation, but the smart, self-possessed girls who number among her fans will find things to like.</p></div>"
210,fall,2008,f2008,versace,"Finally, at the last gasp of Milan, it fell to Donatella Versace to rush to the rescue of the imminent Sunday-night Academy Awards. And who better, in a week when there was scarcely a floor-sweeping gown on a runway (unless it was made of, er, tweed)? There were no apologies for a drop-dead dress from DV, of course. There were 11 of them, in fact, with two liquid nude-colored bodice huggers running neck and neck for outstanding achievement. (Arguably, Carmen Kass won by a breast.)</p><p>The fact that Versace can turn it on like that is a surprise to no one. More of an eye-opener is how far she has moved away from the bling-vulgarity stereotype that dogged this house until a couple of years ago. Mostly, this collection was about carefully considered structure—short dresses and coats with flying volumes in the back—rather than front-loaded sexiness. Some of Versace's most glamorous—and on-trend—cocktail dresses even hit to mid-calf (a one-shouldered draped midnight-blue number and another in a combination of matte and wet-look black were stunning).</p><p>Though most of the pieces were single-colored and unembellished, there was also a breakout of print along the way. Versace had commissioned the Dutch artist Tim Roeloffs to work on a photomontage of urban cityscapes, musclemen, dogs, Versace china, and the house ad campaigns, and then collaged the results onto violent purple, fuchsia, and yellow dresses. Result: very Versace. You couldn't help thinking the late, great Gianni would have loved it.</p></div>"
211,fall,2008,f2008,viktor-rolf,"""We love fashion, but it's going so fast. We wanted to say 'No' this season."" Thus spoke Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren to a group of devoted fans and curious reporters eager to parse the meaning of a somewhat difficult Fall show that began with a precise gray trench, the word ""No"" popping out from its chest in 3-D, and ended with a strapless black tulle dress gathered below the knee and embroidered with the phrase ""Dream on.""</p><p>More than three weeks into the collections, with another five days left to go, no one is going to argue the point with the Dutch designers. And they did manage to express the frustrations we all feel, with characteristic irony: with staples (as in metal fastenings, not wardrobe classics). They were golden staples, to be precise, and they stood in for seams at the waist of a peplum jacket and in pleats on a pair of baggy trousers; they fastened ruffles to the shoulder and hem of an asymmetrical party frock; and they became a form of glam embroidery on a strapless, tiered gown. Without them, these clothes (the frilled organza blouses, the nipped-waist red sheath, the belted fox coat) would've landed squarely on the predictable side of French chic. With them, and in such great numbers, the results felt gimmicky.</p></div>"
212,fall,2008,f2008,vivienne-tam,"Hong Kong Disneyland, of all things, recently tapped Tam, a native daughter, to design New Year's outfits for Minnie and Mickey in celebration of the Year of the Rat. Human versions of the celebrity mouse look were unveiled on the Fall runway. Unfortunately, there were no program notes to explain the startling apparition of the big-eared cartoon guy on various pieces here and there—incongruous, to say the least, among other clothes inspired by Himalayan thangka paintings (of all things). The other main leitmotif was the dimensional cutout technique that Tam has made her own, but which was also much used last season. Positive notes were pieces that demonstrated modernity and restraint, like a black coat with openwork, a dress with textural quilted clouds, a burgundy sequined jacket, and a cute gold cardigan-and-embroidered-skirt combo. Meanwhile, though, the metallic tights and Minnie Mouse shoes distracted from the clothes, some of which were ill-fitting. Even Disney magic couldn't save this one.</p></div>"
213,fall,2008,f2008,vivienne-westwood,"Dame Viv is back in London! Showing a collection that glories in the girls who turned King's Road into an endless fashion show from one end of the seventies to the other. Glam poseurs, sexy secretaries, and perverse punks—all present and correct!</p><p>Actually, for accuracy's sake, the above needs a little qualification. Vivienne Westwood has never stopped living in London, though she's shown her main line in Paris for almost a decade and has no plans to change that. The collection she showed today was her second line, Red Label, and it was here by popular demand from retailers. ""I never really wanted to show a second line [on the runway] because it's such a lot of work,"" she said. ""But it's good because it means I don¿t have to let go all of the ideas I have so quickly. There¿s an awful lot of energy in London now, and I found it much easier to show than it used to be. There's help; sponsorship; fantastic hair, makeup, production people; and really top girls.""</p><p>If Britain's national fashion treasure had any lingering reservations that showing her commercial line might tarnish her reputation, the effect ended up just the opposite. Fifteen years ago no one would have predicted such an incendiary nutcase would ever survive in business, let alone live to swish a wearable collection of in-demand Westwood-isms in the face of her gainsayers. But that was what it was: a lineup of pinstripe tailoring, tartan kilts, knits, and coats with rounded lapels stamped with the baggy-hemmed, asymmetric hallmarks of the Westwood classic. The fact that it's all at an accessible price—even the gorgeous versions of her draped-bosom evening dresses—is, for a democrat like Viv, perhaps the biggest triumph. No wonder it looked like a victory parade when she came out at the end of the show arm in arm with one of London's It girls of the moment, Lily Donaldson.</p></div>"
214,fall,2008,f2008,vpl,"Victoria Bartlett, who focused on dancers last season—and suffragettes the season before that—stepped away from the barre and turned her attention to another of her obsessions: sculpture. Hans Bellmer's mechanical dolls and Louise Bourgeois' ""pendulous, glandular"" forms were of particular interest, as the designer took, to quote the program, ""a journey across the geography of the body."" Bartlett herself translated that to mean that ""the curving and seaming follow the musculature lines, which is an inherent VPL theme.""</p><p>If the concept was a bit heavy, its execution was pleasingly light. It's not necessary to have an art history degree to understand the appeal of a great knit, a sturdy coat with a subtly rounded asymmetric hem, or a slightly off-kilter silken shift dress. One of Bartlett's collaborations this season was with Icelandic hair artist Hrafnhildur Arnardottir, also known as Shoplifter, who contributed some hirsute accessories that were cleverly integrated into the presentation. It was a well-honed collection, and, despite the highfalutin sources, more down-to-earth than Bartlett's last.</p></div>"
215,fall,2008,f2008,wunderkind,"Wolfgang Joop's space-age set—a pair of giant, pulsing half-spheres around which the models walked—was straight out of <em>2046</em>, the Kar Wai Wong sci-fi film. The clothes themselves were more <em>Lolita</em>. Well, not exactly, but this was Joop's youngest-feeling Wunderkind collection yet, full of neon-bright prints, fabric collages, and mini lengths, all accessorized with ankle boots and opaque tights, or the occasional pair of insane fluorescent-beaded leggings.</p><p>His tweedy bouclé three-piece suits (that's jacket, cropped pants, and mini) came with the exaggerated shoulders that always indicate a designer has the future on his mind. The shoulders carried over into shifts patchworked from quilted yokes, plaid underlayers, and printed chiffons. The lineup's star attractions were a knitted fur coat playfully embellished with tufts of neon Tibetan lamb and a couple of graffiti dresses, one ruched and tiered and to the knee, and the other a loose tent that was longer in back than in front. What his futuristic Lolitas have to do with last season's luxe bohos is anybody's guess, but it looked like Joop had fun dreaming up his pastiche, and as offbeat as it was, it did include plenty of cute pieces.</p></div>"
216,fall,2008,f2008,y-kei,"Gene Kang and Hanii Yoon went back to nature. Yes, there were flowers and mineral prints, but the theme ran deeper: In essence, they were exploring their design roots.</p><p>In a recent interview with Style.com, Kang defined the label's aesthetic as being ""avant-garde romantic,"" but Fall was all the stronger for not trying to be too edgy. In fact, the color-infused clothes evidenced a certain classicism. The opening and closing looks were done in an impressionist garden print slathered with clear sequins. There was a series of fit-and-flare looks in more traditional menswear fabrics, and a virtual bouquet of printed silk dresses. Known for their textile sense, the Korean duo used angora and downy brushed wool for day coats, ombré jacquard for an evening topper, and a lustrous copper velour on a striking long dress. (They also used foil lamé on a mini, but with less success.) All in all, it was a well-pruned collection, and Kang and Yoon are blossoming.</p></div>"
217,fall,2008,f2008,y-3,"As New York fashion week begins, don't you find yourself wondering what the creative minds at Y-3 will bring us next?</p><p>Well, this season they brought a 230-foot wall of ice—they called it a ""glacial installation""—to provide a frosty, wet backdrop for the runway at Pier 40. They also brought the season's new buzzwords: ""purity,"" ""confidence,"" ""functionality,"" and ""elegance.""</p><p>This was a terrific collection that squarely hit the mark of what Y-3 should be: a little sporty, a lot of Yohji. The collection ran the gamut from baggy, drop-crotch Charlie Chaplin suits (some in big, brazen tartans) to long, draped layers of gothic black to Chanel-tweedy jackets that recalled Yamamoto's 1996 homage to the house that Coco built. The beauty of this still-strange marriage between Japanese avant-garde and track-and-field shone through in the artistic details, like the gently flared waist and poet sleeves on a practical anorak. The strong showing at Y-3 coincides happily with the February 5 opening of the brand's first New York flagship, in the Meatpacking District; the doors to another major store swing open in Soho next month. There was so much heat, we're surprised it didn't melt the ice.</p></div>"
218,fall,2008,f2008,yigal-azrouel,"The Israeli designer traded in the chill, sunbaked surfer scene of his Spring show for a bit of New York attitude. His 47-piece collection was shown against a hyperkinetic video backdrop shot on an alphabet soup of subway lines in the span of about two weeks by Chiara Clemente (who is soon to release <em>Our City Dreams</em>, a film portrait of five women artists living in Gotham). Before the show, Azrouël said that he wanted to stress the individuality of each look, which goes some way toward explaining the sometimes puzzling confluences. The mix brought to mind the sort of outfits you might see on strange seat-fellows crowded together on a rush-hour IRT car: a delicate dress embroidered with feathers, for example, jostling for space with plaid asymmetric shirtdresses, a pair of saggy-seated washed-leather stovepipe pants, and Alaïa-esque separates. Over the past few seasons, Azrouël's work has had a somewhat scruffed-up effect—the best example being his shrunken leather jackets—but the strongest looks in Fall's mash-up were draped and suspended pieces that didn't look like they were trying to ""be"" anything (or prove anything). These, no doubt, were the good things that happened when Azrouël, as he put it, ""let the fabric tell me what to do.""</p></div>"
219,fall,2008,f2008,yohji-yamamoto,"Fresh off a partnership with Mikimoto in which he created a line of nontraditional pearl jewelry, Yohji Yamamoto debuted another high-profile collaboration on his Fall runway: leather portfolio bags made in unison with Hermès. The avant-garde Japanese designer betrayed an interest in old-line French luxury-goods houses last year at this time when he did his own tongue-in-cheek riff on the Louis Vuitton logo. But Yamamoto fans shouldn't worry that aligning himself with an established brand like Hermès means he's gone straight. On the contrary: It sparked an interest in manipulating leather (not to mention a horse-print motif) to his own ends, and got him thinking about novel ways to approach some of his best-loved tropes.</p><p>First up were his familiar hard-soft jackets. The aforementioned leather—most often in black, but also in shades of orange and blue, and always with unfinished raw edges—met tailored wool or draped jersey to create appealing toppers that had a new languidness. These, like the more structured peplum jackets in charcoal gray and colorful tweeds that followed, were paired with the long, full skirts Yamamoto loves. The latter, it must be said, were made even more challenging than usual by the girth-extending extra rolls of fabric at the waistband. Still, the show ended on a high note, with a quintet of models wearing smart, long coats in khaki or navy (some of them tossed over the back and suspended from built-in straps), each girl carrying one of those fab Hermès portfolios.</p><p>If any more proof was needed that Yamamoto still marches to his own beat, it came over the loudspeakers: The guitarist whose taped recording accompanied the show was none other than the designer himself.</p></div>"
220,fall,2008,f2008,zac-posen,"If last season's criticized Shaker collection was going to teach Zac Posen anything, it might've been this: to dial down the ebullience. But that's not what happened at his Fall show, which both referenced Minnie Mouse and invoked a bordello. The models wore pompoms on either side of their tight chignons, and many of the dresses were sheer enough to reveal spangled underwear and black garter belts. After-dark options edged out daywear by a wide margin, which was too bad, because the most elegant piece here was, hands down, a herringbone-tweed sheath, and it would have been great if the focus had been more of the same. That isn't to say eveningwear is a bad thing, but crinolines—which he showed under a robe à la française and a mini-parachute dress—are quite another story.</p><p>Posen cut all of the sugar and spice with great tailoring, some of it in a soft-quilted cloque that his program notes dubbed ""bubble wrap."" On the harder side, a Prince of Wales schoolboy suit looked signature—it was curvy and fit like a glove—but it didn't have quite the sex appeal of a plunging Le Smoking jumpsuit.</p><p>For the first time, he brought out his sister and creative director, Alexandra, for a post-finale bow. It seemed a strange disconnect, because so much of this collection looked designed not for grown-up women (ones with jobs) but for living dolls.</p></div>"
221,fall,2008,f2008,zero-maria-cornejo,"Zero is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, and—its Chilean designer, Maria Cornejo, said with characteristic positivity—the current mission is to ""redefine"" its identity: ""We are concentrating on our own sense of peace and our roots, without getting caught up in the fashion madness.""</p><p>Cornejo held her show on Bleecker Street in the gutted space that will be home to her new Zero boutique. Though the space is raw, the collection was anything but. It was a playful exploration of ""madness in color."" A vibrant nomadic print and a rainbow-striped angora topper were more successful, perhaps, than the experiments with color-blocked fluorescents. Wanting to keep things closer to the body, she did more classic tailoring than usual, offering suits and a number of great coats (a midnight-blue lacquered tweed one was especially striking). ""My roots are in Latin America,"" Cornejo explained, ""where color makes you feel alive.""</p></div>"
222,fall,2008,f2008,3-1-phillip-lim,"He's a designer who often dismisses his clothes with an offhand, ""It's just pretty. It's not trying to <em>be</em> anything."" But a few days before his Fall show, it was obvious that Phillip Lim had a lot on his mind—from the tanking economy's effect on both the world at large and his own expanding business to the growing up he's done personally as a designer to, oh, Stevie Nicks and David Bowie.</p><p>Boil it all down and Lim's major impetus was maturity, his own and his customers'. That was clear from the first look out, a suede duster over a silk blouse and a midcalf skirt that looked a bit dowdy. But variety is the beauty of 3.1, and one of the reasons it's a retail darling: Stores and girls can buy it and wear it their way. So, amid the more staid fare (a thin gray V-neck sweater over gray flannels, or ladylike matelassé coats and dresses), Lim kicked up the cool factor with a tiny leather flight jacket (worn with an urban-bohemian maxidress) and what he calls ""the new power suit"": a black denim boyfriend blazer over terrific matching wide-leg jeans. There were several great dresses and great coats, too. Soon, 3.1 boutiques will be opening in Tokyo and Los Angeles, and shoppers will easily find what they came for.</p></div>"
223,fall,2008,f2008,6267,"The sight of an A-list lineup of editors and buyers trooping into a 6267 show at 8:30 p.m. on a cold Milan night (and after Prada, too) is proof of the industry's goodwill toward any sign of young life springing up in this city. 6267's Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, a pair of ex-MaxMara designers, have earned a certain level of respect from the international fashion community in the past couple of years: They have a handle on the ""Made in Italy"" quality that cuts it in major department stores, and as the show started, hopes were high that they'd be able to put over something fresh.</p><p>Did they succeed? In part. The collection was inspired, they said, by Josef Hoffmann and the Wiener Werkstätte—a sort of black-and-white alternative to the gilded exoticism of Gustav Klimt, which has been gaining so much currency elsewhere this season. The first look—a narrow black maxi coat with a raised waist and a high, furled collar—and a couple of columnar print dresses later in the show, put Aquilano and Rimondi in sync with the emerging feeling for longer lengths. Their concentration on working neatly tailored jackets and a skinny-leg pant widening to a slight flare also proved an awareness of directional trends. Still, as a whole, the designers' use of diagonal windowpane check; a narrow, poufed shoulder line; tubular trimmings on necklines; flat bows; and silver buttons was too derivative of Nicolas Ghesquière's Balenciaga. These guys undoubtedly have talent, but, like so many other young designers, they need to articulate what they want to say in a voice of their own. Holding back from overworking their things would be one step in the right direction—as would getting out to experience the world a bit more. Milan is still a great city in which to make clothes of quality, but it's also a provincial place from which it's not always easy to grasp the bigger picture.</p></div>"
1,spring,2009,s2009,a-f-vandevorst,"After exploring their tailored, masculine side for Fall, An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx today dipped into the lingerie drawer that constitutes the other half of their dual style. That meant their signature white shirts were topped with lace-trimmed satin bras and long, front-slit slips, or that girdles peeked out from above the waistline of a pair of black pants. Other times, garter belts were plainly visible above white back-seam stockings worn over black hose. Most of that won't play outside the bedroom; the red, heavily lined lips—one part drag queen, another part little girl playing in Mommy's makeup—added an extra kink factor. Good thing there were elements to the collection that were more softly feminine: The quilted, floral kimono silk bustier and skirt that accompanied a peachy-orange button-down blouse had a grown-up sophistication and real-life appeal.</p></div>"
2,spring,2009,s2009,abaete,"The intricate hand-stitching inside an antique Victorian vest is what prompted Laura Poretzky to turn things inside out for Spring. Sometimes, though, the resulting underwear-as-outerwear was a bit too obvious: A blue-and-white striped dress, for example, was interrupted in the middle by a white mesh panel with corset detailing that caused an awkward bunching of fabric at the waist and gave the garment a rather unfinished quality. More on the mark were the flirty, full-skirted dresses in chambray and cotton shirting, and the subtler knit numbers outlined with seams and worn over sleek tanks at the beginning of the show. Poretzky was at her best when she kept things simple.</p></div>"
3,spring,2009,s2009,adam-lippes,"Not even a last-minute tropical storm-induced shift indoors could ruffle Adam Lippes' feathers. ""I think the colors will pop even more against all this brown,"" he said of his 11th-hour venue, a Victorian Gothic church in Chelsea. And pop they did, in hues inspired by Museum of Modern Art's color-chart exhibit earlier this year. Lippes was at his best when he kept it bright and uncomplicated—with a cerulean georgette gown, for example (a shorter version in amber was also nice). Other standouts included a pair of groovy shift dresses, one embroidered with a rainbow of molded plastic beads and another with clear Lucite shapes that swished like fringe down the catwalk. With the exception of some distracting straps and buckles, this solid collection should spell fair weather ahead for Lippes.</p></div>"
4,spring,2009,s2009,adidas-by-stella-mccartney,"It's a little harder than usual to concentrate on making fashion notes when your mouth has just fallen open and your head is cricked back at 45 degrees, and the ""model""—the champion trampolinist Bryony Page—has just rotated her body in a perfect circle in midair 30 feet above you. But such were the thrills taking place at Linley Hall in Victoria—transformed overnight into ""Stella's Gym,"" complete with Olympic athletes including Allyson Felix and Victoria Pendleton—at the launch of Stella McCartney's Spring Adidas collection.</p><p>""We like to push it a bit further each season,"" said McCartney, who in recent years has streaked ahead of the field in transforming the aesthetics of women's performance sportswear. Now the collection spans running, gym, yoga, dance, tennis, golf, swimwear, and accessories, all characterized by a sharp eye for fashion detail and, this season, popping with neon pinks, grass green, yellow, and periwinkle blue. In one corner were gymnasts performing on the balance beam in leotards and yoga sweats; in another, the tennis team knocked balls about in scalloped-edge dresses over orange shorts. Elsewhere, runners warmed up on treadmills wearing high-tech spray-painted leggings. What gives McCartney the edge? Personal commitment, of course. Strolling around looking super-toned, she pointed to a group of girls working out on an apparatus devised by her personal trainer, Tracy Anderson, the woman who's given Madonna her body. Anderson has consulted on the development of McCartney's gym line, and if that's the first step to looking that good, we're in.</p></div>"
5,spring,2009,s2009,akris,"There's a rumor going around Paris that Akris is dressing the Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, but we didn't see much that was campaign trail-friendly on the runway today.</p><p>The brand is known for its understated, chic tailoring and exquisite, expensive fabrics. Designer Albert Kriemler likes to show off the know-how of the company's textile mills in St. Gallen, Switzerland. So, tapping into the current see-through trend, he spliced the label's superclean jackets with sheer panels, suspended step-pleated georgette from illusion necklines, and layered pencil skirts over net slips. The overall effect, thanks in part to an icy gray, light blue, nude, and white palette, was light and unfussy. (Still, however refined it was, when politicians talk about ""transparency,"" this isn't usually what they mean.)</p><p>What really stood out were Kriemler's flower-print silk georgette dresses. If not a first at Akris, they were truly an unusual sight. To make them, he had the famous mill pixelate photographs of gardens; the impressionistic results called to mind Monet at Giverny. Again, not exactly Sarah Palin's kind of thing, but we'll be paying extra-special attention at Thursday night's big debate.</p></div>"
6,spring,2009,s2009,alberta-ferretti,"At her best, Alberta Ferretti does pretty in a way every woman can get. It's not a collection that should cause anyone to get hung up on concept or theme, or—in this case—fuss too much over the fact that the intellectual link between ""Grecian"" and ""flapper"" is, to put it mildly, a little tenuous. Just so long as the easy, fluttery, feminine options for evening keep coming, Ferretti gets an unspoken pass. This season, within two or three outfits, it was clear she was keeping up her end of the bargain.</p><p>Vertical, tiered fringing that suggested Fortuny pleating introduced the show, swiftly followed by one of Ferretti's signature whipped-around twirls of chiffon. The Greek-nymph side of the collection may be a reprise of her hits from last Spring, but no harm in that: Ferretti's signature way of draping a georgette dress can be gorgeous, and especially so when left to speak for itself—sans accessories—with flat sandals. Having established that, she wove in a series of short charmeuse cocktail dresses with Jazz Age tassels, and even something cool in the way of a dressy evening chino and a ribbon-lace capri pant. Save for a few moments when the fringe veered toward Spanish-shawl or showgirl territory, it made for a collection that will keep Ferretti's followers very happy, and likely gain her quite a few more.</p></div>"
7,spring,2009,s2009,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua is always slightly off at a tangent from other people in Milan, and therein lies his potential to either charm or puzzle. Taken as a whole, his Spring collection was puzzling: part hippie chick, part demi-couture (even though you couldn't be categorically certain about it), a bit Pocahontas. He'd certainly received the Milan memo about fringing and cut and stitched it into tiered mixes of suede and ostrich, the best being a forest green modern flapper dress that came somewhere toward the end.</p><p>Still, what of the charm? Now that beige and nude colorations have become the thing of the moment, Dell'Acqua has come into his own, at least in parts. His talent for lingerie detailing looked strong in a little pink multilayered chiffon wrap dress with a black lace bra top, and carried over into his baby pink charmeuse tailored jacket, wrapped by a tulle cummerbund. Otherwise, it was hard to make sense of exactly where a gray seventies maxi dress in tissue-fine jersey fitted in, or, again, how that related to the lean, cream tailoring at the beginning. Perhaps it's pointless to ask for systemic organization on the runway here, though. Dell'Acqua is a small designer with a talent for making one-off gorgeous things rather than thinking big thoughts, and that's enough to keep him in business, season in, season out.</p></div>"
8,spring,2009,s2009,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen, environmentalist? That was the unexpected message that emanated from the mouth of a runway that was backed by a video projection of a revolving Earth, and flanked by a zoo of stuffed animals: an elephant, giraffe, polar bear, lion, and assorted other endangered species. McQueen explained, through program notes, that he had been pondering Charles Darwin, the survival of the fittest, and the deleterious results of industrialization on the natural world.</p><p>Strangely, the thought didn't set off one of his angry forays into the destructive side of human psychology. If anything, the beginning of the show—the section that dealt with a world untouched by man—unbuttoned the romanticism and delicacy that is, paradoxically, the strongest side of McQueen's appeal. Though his shapes hardly wavered from his signature frock coats, skinny-leg pants, and hourglass silhouettes, the wood-print tailoring was more fluid and some of the dresses exceptional. Pink or lemon flowers were trapped beneath short, nude netting shifts, and two of the season's most sublime forms of fringing came draped across the body in dégradé gray or swishing in pink filaments from a flapper dress.</p><p>McQueen's couture sensibilities are breathtaking in close-up, where the detail of flowers and birds becomes visible in lace underlayers and then echoed in lace ankle-wrappings incorporated in shoes. He also gave himself over to a long passage of bright, multicolored allover prints, engineered to fit around jackets, leggings, and cocoon dresses—new on the Paris runway, but also part of general trend emanating from London's young designers. Even as the show moved into evening and the part that symbolized the negative impact of twenty-first-century evolution, the black crystal-encrusted dresses and bodysuits never quite descended into melodrama. McQueen said he ""doesn't want to preach"" about such a serious subject. More likely, he wants to sell next Spring, and this collection, with its color, detail, and eased-up tailoring, looks likely to be one of his most commercially viable.</p></div>"
9,spring,2009,s2009,alexander-wang,"""They wanted color, they got color!"" Alexander Wang declared a few days before his show. After a Fall collection done almost entirely in black, the new palette took shape during a trip to Miami, home not just of those amazing tropical Art Deco pastels but also of the so-bad-it's-good eighties Deco-redux tackiness of <em>Miami Vice</em>.</p><p>A determination to move forward is indispensable to a young designer at a crossroads, and Wang is gaining momentum with his new shoe collection and a diffusion line of T-shirts called T by Alexander Wang. The imaginary muse for his Spring show, he said, was a sexy, devil-may-care sort who would play basketball in a dress; hence the mesh insert patterned like beads of sweat on a draped jersey goddess number. But even with the infusion of brighter, more body-conscious looks, Wang's familiar grunge girl was still very present here—her toughness heightened by pierced and fringed black leather platform sandals.</p><p>There was an athletic edge to the proceedings, and—with the exception of cropped muscle tees and Swarovski-laden sweatpants—it worked. Several of the sporty pieces (especially the silk cargo pants, a sleek anorak, and fringed sweatshirts) will be winners with the kind of go-getter who likes to cap off an all-night party with a pickup game at the West 4th Street courts.</p></div>"
10,spring,2009,s2009,alexandre-herchcovitch,"The fact that there wasn't more than met the eye at Brazilian Alexandre Herchcovitch's show was a good thing. His rather ponderous mission statement, declaring the collection ""a focused study of politically troubled, foreign-ruled, war-torn countries,"" was germane only insomuch as it gave context to the khaki military details that appeared throughout. As for the Vaseline around the models' eyes, that was not meant to be tears, and—no, Herchcovitch explained backstage—the strange ""editorial"" ruffled crotches that appeared a few times had nothing to do with sex (mind out of the gutter!).</p><p>The show was in parts wearable (Ottoman-inspired print blouses paired with short, gorgeous sequined lamé dresses) and outrageous (see above). The best way to understand it was to learn that Herchcovitch started his career working alongside his mother among lingerie and lace. Suddenly (forget Freud) his almost Victorian indulgence in chiffon and ruffles fell into place: The designer's heart belongs to Mama, and the clothes—some seriously oversize shoulders aside—were not a political statement but an homage to the boudoir. Titled ""Army of Love,"" the collection might not win over the centrist mainstream, but it had a quirky appeal.</p></div>"
11,spring,2009,s2009,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"Bustles, exposed undergirdings, swaddled fabrics—the Vivienne Westwood touchstones have been coming fast and furious from all quarters lately. You could even make the argument that the geometric flaps that have appeared everywhere from Calvin Klein to Dolce &amp; Gabbana were pioneered by Dame Viv. So she's finally seizing the moment to explore the more commercial side of her own oeuvre, right? Not a chance.</p><p>This is a designer who wears a headband with the anti-consumerist message ""branded"" scrolled across it, the one who sends out a new muckraking slogan T-shirt each season. This time it read: ""We need an estimated $30 billion per year to save the rain forest."" That message inspired the show's ""Do It Yourself"" conservation theme. Call it bedsheet couture: Everything from Westwood's familiar asymmetrically wrapped-and-bustled dresses to the capes flung across one shoulder came in frayed fabrics that looked like they could in previous lives have been tablecloths, drapes, or shower curtains.</p><p>Ghetto-fabulous dhoti pants exposed the crotches of models' boxer shorts. Girls wore headscarves as knickers. And there's not much of a retail future in a clear plastic jacket and ball skirt (embroidered in a more traditionally ball skirt-ish striped fabric)—although it undeniably had a certain undone charm. In its very madness, it was classic Westwood.</p></div>"
12,spring,2009,s2009,andrew-gn,"Let other designers chase after the dwindling disposable income of the merely rich. Andrew Gn has set his sights on the superrich. In an odd bit of timing, the Singapore-born, Paris-based designer today debuted his made-to-measure Atelier line: 18 limited-edition outfits boasting lavish couture-grade handwork that start at $15,000 each. If America's financial turmoil had him worried, he wasn't showing it. Anyway, there's always Russia, China, and the Middle East.</p><p>India—the Helena Rubinstein version—was the inspiration for the collection. After a rather sober Fall, he laid on the color: canary yellow, violet, coral, azure, peony, and emerald green. Gobstopper-size crystals—too many of them to count—decorated necklines, waistbands, and hems. Gn's burgeoning costume-jewelry collection got big play, too. The models wore bib necklaces or big drop earrings and matching cuffs on each wrist. It sounds like an eyeful, but it all worked, especially the floaty paisley silk dresses. Gn doesn't specialize in understatement, but there was some to be found, if you were looking, in a black belted jersey tunic dress with golden metal embroidery at the neck and (it's all relative) the beautiful strapless brocade gown that closed the show.</p></div>"
13,spring,2009,s2009,ann-demeulemeester,"The power of an Ann Demeulemeester show is that even if you aren't a card-carrying member of her club, there's something in it for you. For Spring, she showed numerous permutations of her signature look: an unstructured jacket cinched at the back, shown this season with a draped and cowled blouse and narrow cropped trousers. The most striking example, though, came not in black and white (the prototypical Demeulemeester palette) but in coral and nude. The relaxed jacket was a few shades lighter than the bunched and undulating top beneath it, and the pants were candy striped in the same unexpected colors.</p><p>What surprised most about this beautiful collection were the short cotton jersey T-shirt dresses, draped and gathered in a way that evoked both the twenties and tunics. Her liberal use of crystals also felt new. She embroidered them in medallions on vests and softly wrapped dresses or, hitting upon one of the season's recurring themes, strung them like long fringe from the choker collars of high-necked tops. Of course, that was less a case of Demeuelemeester chasing trends than it was a happy coincidence. Happy is the way her audience felt as they left the show.</p></div>"
14,spring,2009,s2009,anna-sui,"As rents up and down Seventh Avenue become more expensive, clothing manufacturers are getting pushed out. If the ""Save the Garment Center"" T-shirt Anna Sui put in her goody bag—what, no free hairstyling products?—and wore to take her bow don't do much to stem the problem, her Spring collection, with all of its beading and appliqué work, might just keep a few factories in business. Sui took inspiration from the way that textile designer, shopkeeper, and New York Mexican restaurant pioneer Alexander Girard and his doll-maker friend Marilyn Neuhart made the folkloric modern. ""Their work was very colorful, optimistic, and happy, which is what I'm pushing these days,"" Sui said.</p><p>The parade of shift dresses, rompers, and peasant tops worn with kicky skirts had a vaguely south-of-the-border feel—think rosebud embroideries, rickrack borders, and fringe detailing. But as usual, there was plenty more in Sui's madcap mix to catch the eye, including astrology prints, a detour into Spanish toreador mode, studded gladiator sandals, and some of the grooviest costume jewelry (made by Erickson Beamon) in a season of groovy costume jewelry. If it didn't put a smile on your face, you weren't paying attention.</p></div>"
15,spring,2009,s2009,anne-valerie-hash,"Last season's experiment with menswear plaids didn't play to Anne Valérie Hash's greatest strength, which has always been a feminine way with draping. Spring finds her on more familiar ground, wrapping the body in the style of ancient Greece by way of Alix Grès. Toga dresses that fell fluidly from twisted straps were among the show's best pieces, and she applied the same relaxed, almost louche mentality to jumpsuits, which she's been crazy about since well before they came into vogue. Too many of them, though, came with see-through chain-mail bodices—apparently, she's also adopted the Greeks' laissez-faire attitude toward nudity.</p><p>In the midst of all that softness were a few structured pieces: a round-shoulder jacket shown with trousers burdened by superfluous straps from hip to ankle, and a handful of far simpler and more successful little dresses. One came in a dusty violet leather pieced at the bodice to cling to curves, and two more were cut in gorgeous, watery Rothko prints with net insets at the back. The collection was hit-or-miss, but it was a marked improvement over Fall.</p></div>"
16,spring,2009,s2009,antonio-berardi,"Born in the U.K. to a Sicilian dad, Antonio Berardi currently lives in London and shows in Paris. Cosmopolitan as he is, it's his Roman Catholic upbringing that he frequently returns to—childhood memories are potent stuff. At the beginning of what was for him a well-balanced show, it seemed like the designer would be content to touch on trends such as transparency, neon colors, and a Stefano Pilati-ish silhouette, and only lightly tweak them with religious references. A hot pink dress, for example, fell like a priest's robes from the model's shoulders. A strapless number with a ruffle spanning the torso and descending to the hem came in cardinal red. And yet another dress, this one sleeveless and fitted, turned to reveal angel's wings along the shoulders.</p><p>Later, Berardi addressed the Catholic Madonna-whore complex full-on with looks in either Communion white or black. As innocent and untouchable as his downy dresses with their scroll-like embroideries were meant to be, they were cut in the same severe hourglass shape that Berardi used for a black openwork lace number that afforded a prime view of the briefs New York lingerie maker Jean Yu designed for the show. In other words, it was all sexy as hell—and yet it didn't feel like Berardi was straining for effect.</p></div>"
17,spring,2009,s2009,aquascutum,"It's the second time there's been a rhapsody in blue on the runway this season, though the one at Aquascutum was in quite a different key from the Gershwin reference that played at Marc Jacobs. Save for the opening passage, this was a collection done almost entirely in blues—a color spectrum that's been preoccupying Michael Herz since his pre-Spring show. It's apparently had a calming and softening effect on him and the clothes. ""Really,"" he remarked, ""all I want is for everything to be easy.""</p><p>That was a good place to start for a line that needs to appeal to women professionals rather than to a closed claque of fashion fiends. Herz brought a fresh air to Aquascutum's outerwear, turning out trenches in parachute silk. Vertical pleats and the odd floating panel, meanwhile, broke up the symmetry of sheaths. Although he loves to manipulate fabric and print, Herz is probably most innovative when he keeps things simple. On that score, it was a long, lean, incredibly elegant jersey pantsuit that looked newest and most convincingly aimed at his target audience.</p></div>"
18,spring,2009,s2009,aquilano-rimondi,"If anyone's finding it a little hard to keep up with the movements of Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi this season, that's hardly surprising. First, they are the guys who have just presented their first collection for Gianfranco Ferré (to a positive reception). Second, they have just shed their former identity as 6267 and renamed themselves, probably more sensibly in the long run, Aquilano.Rimondi. For Spring, that rechristened collection was, as Rimondi put it, ""light, fluid, and fun. Ferré was more architectonic,"" he said. ""Here we wanted to relax a bit."" The pair also claimed Elsa Schiaparelli as a muse, though apart from the slightly eccentric velvet fezes, there wasn't any obvious surrealism in sight. More obviously, the imagery was coming out of the twenties: satin palazzo pants, abstracted flapper fringe (done as tiered tabs on a drop-waist dress and a coat), and antiqued Lurex. Although Aquilano and Rimondi do make pieces well worth crossing a department store to look at, the runway featured too many dresses that—nice as they were—looked derivative of Lanvin. It's understandable if A and R have been stretched this season after taking on Ferré, but once the routine's established, they need to do some more solid groundwork on establishing unique signatures for their own collection.</p></div>"
19,spring,2009,s2009,armand-basi-one,"Sheerness has become a feature of many London presentations this season, Markus Lupfer's Armand Basi One show included. It's an oddity that may reflect the current obsession among the city's young designers with reliving the early nineties, when visible underwear and nipples were commonplace on the runway. (Odd, because if memory serves, no woman ever wore those particular looks outside a fashion shoot.) Aside from the see-through organza shirts, dresses with sheer windows, and even pants made from a kind of black netting, Lupfer is still fascinated by structured volumes, cutting skirts with jutting peplums and showing a line of banana-legged pants. To give him his due, he has been working those pants since before they appeared on a YSL runway, so maybe this season their moment will finally come.</p></div>"
20,spring,2009,s2009,badgley-mischka,"It's been 20 years since Mark Badgley and James Mischka joined forces. There'll presumably be major festivities to mark the milestone when they open up their first store on Madison Avenue (where else?) next spring, but in the meantime, this collection was something to celebrate.</p><p>Rather than look back, the duo moved forward with what was, for them, a pared-down lineup. The goal was to keep things light both figuratively and literally. ""Everything weighs ounces,"" Mischka said. The designers chose only featherweight fabrics—mainly satin and gazar—and nixed the elaborate, heavily encrusted surface decoration they have indulged in (perhaps overindulged in) in years past. ""We just sprinkled it like fairy dust,"" Badgley said of their Spring embellishments. The only extras on a lilac organza cocktail number were dressmaker ruffles, while beaded floral-print dresses had just a subtle glimmer. Prints in general took the place of surface decoration.</p><p>Not only was this a welcome change, but it ensured that the few glittery gowns they did show, beacons of Badgley Mischka's two decades in fashion, really stood out.</p></div>"
21,spring,2009,s2009,balenciaga,"Backstage at Balenciaga, Nicolas Ghesquière talked about his collection, quite simply, as an exploration of ""matte and shine, playing with textures to see how they reflect or absorb light. And playing with our house codes."" There's nothing remotely simple, however, about the complex, futuristic synthesis of line, cut, and glinting surfaces that played out on his runway. It involved silvered Lurex streaking over skin to cover legs, feet, and hands; asymmetric combinations of drape and structure; bonded jersey pantsuits with A-line tunic tops; tissue-fine metallic crinkle-pleated jackets; and, somewhere in the middle, pale suede pieces that looked as if they might have been extruded from some high-spec industrial machine. The show built to an amazing finale series of dresses cut in iridescent gold, silver, pewter, green, and pink ribbon. As one of the models stepped onto the runway in a sequined sheath, Ghesquière glanced over and remarked, ""She looks like a solar panel, no?""</p><p>The genius of Balenciaga is Ghesquière's projection of couture techniques into the world of new technology. A crude stab at describing it might be ""sci-fi couture,"" but the truth is his mind-set renders stock fashion vocabulary redundant. Ghesquière works without references or narrative, pushing experimentation with fabric and cut to the nth degree. Cleverer still is the sense of a grounded core: the recognizable, desirable developments of pants (the evolution of his jodhpurs in mackintosh fabric; the sophisticated motocross shapes), and the precious, shiny, chic bags clutched in every hand.</p></div>"
22,spring,2009,s2009,balmain,"If you're hot, don't stop! The buzz around Christophe Decarnin's Balmain is a smack in the eye for fashion doom-mongering. With vintage Madonna on the soundtrack, his Spring show—all bling and rock-chick fabulousness—gave the opening of Paris fashion week a shot of pure adrenalin. For a girl looking for an instant backstage pass, this is the wardrobe that will send her sailing past the heaviest security on sight.</p><p>Drummer-boy Michael Jackson jackets with the frogging picked out in crystal, souped-up stonewashed jeans, bandage-wrap dresses, sequin-smothered sheaths, teeny tutus, teetering sky-high diamanté-and-stud sandals: Every after-party dream is answered here. It's the kind of shameless pop-bedazzled energy that won Gianni Versace a reputation for tackiness in the high eighties, but also took him to the top. In other words, yes, it's a cliché, but so well done only a true miserablist could fail to smile.</p><p>The thing that separates Decarnin's Balmain from rehashed tat is the execution. The guy has Parisian couture skills up his sleeve—a super-skinny sleeve, finessed upwards into a brilliant new shoulder with a bump-peaked swagger on jackets and dresses. (The eighties never looked like that.) He's also got to be credited as the person who's set the wagons rolling on western (his fringed high-heel ankle boots were last season's most-hunted objects of footwear desire). Now he's following on with something in the same direction: A black suede gown with a rawhide train blazed a trail that copyists will be following overnight.</p></div>"
23,spring,2009,s2009,band-of-outsiders,"If Fall's girl was at home in the Scottish countryside, her Spring counterpart is more about the late lunch at Sant Ambroeus. Scott Sternberg of Boy by Band of Outsiders astutely cast Kirsten Dunst as the face of his lookbook and the star of his video installation, which ran on big screens as guests feathered through the racks. The actress is known for her down-to-earth but slightly mussed personal style, and she brought Boy's edgy basics to life. Blazers came in every variety, from chambray double-breasted to a white linen tuxedo style. Although pants and skirts with paperbag waists felt slightly dated, there was plenty to keep the downtown espresso drinkers happy: Suspender-strapped skirts were a quirkier interpretation of the bandage-dressing trend, and some cotton piqué dresses (one made to look like it was on backwards, another with a twisted button-front placket) suggested Sternberg is aiming to offer women more ambitious options than his usual riffs on the tomboy-schoolgirl look.</p></div>"
24,spring,2009,s2009,barbara-tfank,"A film buff, Barbara Tfank often cites celluloid. This season, she had her eye on the madcap glamour of Carole Lombard and Irene Dunn in the screwball comedies of the thirties. ""It was about wearing your best all the time,"" Tfank said of movies like <em>Twentieth Century</em> and <em>The Awful Truth</em>. ""You know, wearing your gown to breakfast.""</p><p>Tfank went for a soft-focus lens, with a fresh white floral bloused-back column taking the spotlight. The designer's forte, however, is still the impeccable construction of her dresses and coats. For day, she cut crisp white and navy piqué into slim pants and a jacket. Champagne hour, it was all about shine, with slim sparkle tweed and metallic cloque shifts, and an almost glowing fuchsia lamé party dress. Co-starring were Tfank's collaborations with the shoe designer Olivia Morris: silver and gold leather sandals and pumps covered in vintage Bianchini-Ferier fabrics from Tfank's collection. One pair, in a china-print pink brocade, was worn with matching high-waisted pants and a fitted jacket. In today's jeans-and-T-shirt world, being so well turned-out and matchy-matchy is about as offbeat as you can get.</p></div>"
25,spring,2009,s2009,basso-brooke,"Turning Japanese did Bruno Basso and Christopher Brooke a world of favors. Between Hokusai past and <em>Blade Runner</em> future, Japan offered the master printmakers so much inspiration all they had to do was keep it simple and let the prints shine. And that—mercifully—is essentially what they did. From the moment Vlada Roslyakova hit the runway in matching top and leggings with a sculpted obi belt anchoring the look, the eye was dazzled by furious collages of pattern, some of them beaded, or over-embroidered, or crystallized by Swarovski for added eye appeal. Japan also provided the origamilike pleating and folding effects that drew simple jersey shift shapes in at the waist or puckered the fabric of a sheer blouse so it looked like a huge ruffle round the neck. Such effects may sound tricksy, but in fact they served their purpose in enhancing those gorgeous prints. Attention must also be paid to Raouda Assaf's shoes (the heels artfully carved like Japanese ivory) and Stephen Jones' headpieces.</p></div>"
26,spring,2009,s2009,bcbg-max-azria,"Powerful women are much in the spotlight these days, and Lubov Azria, backstage this morning at BCBG Max Azria, counted Hillary Clinton among her inspirations for Spring. But while she mused about politics and fashion, Azria also characterized her collection as ""things that every girl wants to have""—words that aren't usually applied to, say, the average convention-speech saffron pantsuit. The heart of the lineup was the T-shirt dress in multiple variations, cut in colorful fluttery silks and sporty, spongy jerseys that draped easily around the body. You could argue that sartorial comfort engenders confidence, which in turn allows a woman to realize her full potential…or you could just say that these were some very wearable dresses. In the spirit of wear-and-go, she also showed several rompers and jumpsuits. Sure, in theory, nothing says independence like a jumpsuit, but somehow that idea still smacks of a late-disco-era conception of liberation; and when was the last time you saw a girl on the street wearing one, anyway? (Though we may be eating our words before the end of the week.) Lubov and her husband, Max, apparently also counted Beijing's Olympians among their heroes this season: Sporting details like shrunken anoraks and undershirt tanks peeking out from under a silk frock kept the mood buoyantly tomboyish. Most of the looks were a success, in fact, a little repetition and a few too-weighty evening options aside. Ah, well, early to bed and early to rise only helps a girl conquer the world.</p></div>"
27,spring,2009,s2009,behnaz-sarafpour,"Though she's sometimes veered from the path, Behnaz Sarafpour's raison d'être is to offer a younger spin on dresses for gossip-girls-on-the-town who might not want to wear the same Oscar frock as mother. And that's just where Spring went: a ladylike look made slightly sporty with slim drawstring silk pants (think Audrey Hepburn goes to the gym) and webbed belts, and slightly techy with a blurry photo-print floral used throughout. These ideas were more successful than a brief flirtation with Trekkie shoulders on button-down shirts, or a grouping that went too far with the scalloped petals of silk. There were also some straightforward pretty clothes that made use of none of the above but still had youthful appeal, like a slim shift in floral cloque, boxy suits and dresses in petal-print jacquard, and a fresh white frock with ombré lavender stripes. But gaping holes in the rows of chairs indicated that Sarafpour might need more than this to make her show a priority once again in a crowded schedule.</p></div>"
28,spring,2009,s2009,benjamin-cho,"His show may have started an hour late (one notable store owner left before the lights dimmed), but judging by the partylike atmosphere in Benjamin Cho's front row, guests like Natasha Lyonne, Mary-Kate Olsen, and her boyfriend Nate Lowman weren't fazed. ""I wanted to go back to the beginning of my career,"" Cho said. ""A culmination of my years as a designer, but with new elements."" Indeed, the 18 looks he sent down the runway were classic Cho silhouettes. Body-con minidresses and skinny trousers ruled, the former looking fresh with an architectural off-the-shoulder collar. The craftiness that has become a signature of sorts (all aspects of the collection, according to Cho, were done by hand) swung both ways. It allowed for quirky details like a sash of braided tassels or a sleeve trimmed with keys, yet some garments appeared unfinished at the seams. Were he any other designer, Cho's particular style would be better suited to a presentation format, but then the downtown set would have one less occasion to convene and lend their support to a friend.</p></div>"
29,spring,2009,s2009,betsey-johnson,"""This is the grandma show of all time!"" enthused Betsey Johnson, who welcomed Ella, granddaughter number two, into the family fold this year. The show had a seemingly tyke-friendly theme of pirates-meets-Peter Pan, but—needless to say—Betsey is no ordinary Grams, and although it was a romp, this was no <em>Romper Room</em>.</p><p>Johnny Depp, a.k.a. the drunken Captain Jack Sparrow, was another inspiration behind the collection; it seems he and Johnson have formed a mutual admiration society. (Hey, they both wear ribbons in their hair, don't they?) The models, even when sporting strangely attractive hoop-skirted dresses in kiddie-nursery prints, didn't G-rate their sex appeal. And the final ""Robbed Royalty"" section of the show, which involved handcuffed brides, kept Ellen von Unwerth's flashbulb popping.</p><p>Johnson herself, who took her traditional runway cartwheel dressed as Peter Pan, conceded that some of the show clothes were ""over-the-top."" (They will, of course, be adapted for retail.) That said, she really is focusing on broadening her label's appeal. Victorian jackets, bathing suits, intarsia sweaters, va-va-voom corsets, and tie-dyed maxi dresses added an accessibly trendy Tinker Bell flash to the zany proceedings. Clap your hands if you believe in magic!</p></div>"
30,spring,2009,s2009,blumarine,"The first dress, a nude draped halter with subtle accents of yellow at the ruffled neckline, suggested we might be in for a new Blumarine—if not minimal (come on, who are we kidding?) then at least more restrained. But Anna Molinari is a designer who never met a sequin she didn't like, and after that sexy, almost spare warmup, it was back to the embellishments that she knows best. A lush floral watercolor print alternately brightened up a belted dress; high-waisted, tapering pants; and a floor-length gown with a hip-high slit. Beads and, yes, sequins made multiple appearances—on her familiar cardigans, at the necklines of tanks and the waistbands of pants, and in a dégradé effect on a va-va-voom cocktail number. They also showed up in more girlish, floral patterns on a group of blush-colored dresses.</p><p>The draped tulle goddess minidresses and gowns were a welcome reprieve from all that glitter—they'll play with the Hollywood starlet set. Molinari is clearly quite comfortable with her formula, but it'd be nice to see her push a little further into new territory.</p></div>"
31,spring,2009,s2009,bottega-veneta,"""It's not a time to be ostentatious with clothes,"" said Tomas Maier backstage at Bottega Veneta, fingering an artfully faded-out floral-sprigged print on a tea-stained cotton shirtdress. ""But our customer has never been like that. And it's not about seasonal dressing anymore—that's gone. People like clothes they can collect and wear for years."" Maier's alertness to the sensitivities of our troubled times is part of an emerging picture in Milan. His version of downbeat luxury in muted browns—caramel through dark saffron, copper, and chestnut—is actually no less expensive in the execution of amazing fabric treatments and handcrafted leathers than it's ever been. But intuitive designers cannot help but figure collective anxieties in their work, and something in this collection—albeit at the highest-flown level of sophistication—speaks of the need to hold on to permanent values, to lie low and even, maybe, stay home.</p><p>That is something of a turnaround for a label aimed at the outgoing high achievers of the world. It wasn't so obvious at the outset, when Maier's minimal leather pinafores, olive-drab jumpsuits, and over-the-head mushroom dresses looked like a quieter version of business as usual. But the second half of the show held the surprise: shirtwaisters and dirndls in fabrics inspired by frayed curtains, antique wallpaper, and furnishings that roused a fleeting but distinct sense of the American prairie, threadbare times, and the colors of the dust bowl.</p></div>"
32,spring,2009,s2009,brian-reyes,"Brian Reyes hit the mark in a strong collection inspired by the geologically extreme landscapes of Death Valley, Arizona, and Ethiopia. Reyes was sure-handed with his references, and the earthy palette of sand and stone was as literal as it gets (we're giving him a pass on the zebra-print suit). Other subtler prints worked just fine; a marble one in a warm shade of rust could have been an aerial view of Earth's caverns and curves, but the dresses and tops it landed on will look just fine from down here, too. Reyes kept the silhouette clean and close to the body, but the volume-adding pieces he used—like the sleeveless open ""dresses"" worn as coats that would look right when it's too warm for a trench—stayed light. The navy cocktail number with allover mosaic beading that closed the show was a stunner, and it neatly summed up Reyes' elegant evolution.</p></div>"
33,spring,2009,s2009,bruno-pieters,"Bruno Pieters dedicated his collection to Pierre Cardin, but beyond the fact that nearly every fabric had a subtle shine, there was nothing overtly space-age about the clothes. Over the last couple of seasons, the Belgian designer has established a certain precise tailoring—narrow and sharp as a razor blade—as his signature. For Spring, he applied Cardin's stark black-and-white palette and even more rigorous sense of structure to his already severe approach. Shoulders (which are quickly shaping up to be a Paris hot zone) were squared, creating, in effect, boxy cap sleeves on trim cropped jackets worn with slim above-the-knee skirts, as well as on short dresses with V necklines cut almost down to the waist. The same geometric angles made an appearance on the front of a skirt, too, but they looked just as tricky here as they did anywhere else. Pieters was at his best working instead with curves, close to the body, as he did with one zip-front white vest and skirt that were tiny and sexy.</p></div>"
34,spring,2009,s2009,burberry-prorsum,"This year, Britain officially had the dullest summer recorded since 1929. With August rainfall over 40 percent higher than average, it was about as miserable as anyone can remember, except possibly for the makers of raincoats, like Burberry. You could see how that big washout might have seeped into Christopher Bailey's consciousness when the first girl advancing along the runway looked from a distance like a survivor of Bestival, the Isle of Wight's recent storm-drenched music event. There she was, trudging home with apparently sodden flares, a rain-soaked cape, and a patchwork crusher hat jammed firmly down on her forehead.</p><p>Bailey called the collection ""Garden Girls,"" and said he'd been inspired by his own garden in Yorkshire, and a Thames &amp; Hudson book on eccentric Brits called <em>Garden People</em>—never types to be daunted by a bit of mud. To turn that thought into a collection, Bailey worked tints of ochers, browns, and mossy greens into a slew of fabrics, skinny cardigans, boyfriend pantsuits, and leather that looked as if it had all been treated to a good downpour.</p><p>Among the dip-dyed and crinkled effects, there were some great items. Anyone who jumped on Burberry's flares last season will love this Spring's extreme version: the shrink-to-the-leg cheesecloth trouser that made a clever compromise between sheer leggings and a pant. Fans of Bailey's super-deluxe trenches—a feature of his last three shows—will also be more than happy with the update: dull steel-gray python, sometimes richly embellished with paillettes running up from the hem. Still, although Bailey worked up to brighter gold brocades and gunmetal lamé in the closing passages, the show could have benefited from a sunnier outlook for next summer, and a stricter edit.</p></div>"
35,spring,2009,s2009,calvin-klein-collection,"Francisco Costa's Calvin Klein Collection was a meditation on form. Not the female form, but, rather, geometric shapes. Many of the pieces looked as if they were draped and pressed over cubes, so that the short sleeves of a dress or the side panels of a jacket retained their three-dimensional echoes. The process gave Costa's soft, luxurious fabrics an airy sort of volume that was reinforced by a strict, cool palette of white, nude, icy lavender, and polar blue. When the idea was worked subtly it produced some lovely pieces, notably a white strapless dress with intricate pleats and folds at the neckline that didn't ignore the female body underneath. Too often, though, form trumped function, and the clothes looked boxy and square—a look that's hard to pull off if you're not a curveless 16-year-old. Fall's Calvin collection showed Costa in better form: intellectual, yes, but not at the expense of sex appeal. This season, he didn't quite hit the mark.</p></div>"
36,spring,2009,s2009,carlos-miele,"A celebration of all things Brazilian was at the core of Carlos Miele's Spring show. Megastar Seu Jorge performed live; ""it was a special song I made just for Carlos,"" the singer said backstage, fresh from mingling with the models as they breezed across the runway in the floaty chiffon gowns Miele is known for. Miele drew inspiration from the lush rain forest that borders his hideaway in Florianópolis: The shadows, colors, and movement of the vegetation inspired splashy tropical patterns and billowy, whisper-thin layers. Brazilian-sourced natural stones were polished and used to trim plunging necklines, while extra-chunky rough-cut versions adorned cuffs and rings. A standout military jacket was also given the Miele treatment and edged with chiffon fan pleats. So what is the thread that ties it all together? Seu Jorge summed it up best: ""Carlos and I have strong roots in our country, yet we are citizens of the world. But when all is said and done, we do it the Brazilian way.""</p></div>"
37,spring,2009,s2009,carolina-herrera,"Let other designers batten down the hatches against the flagging economy. Carolina Herrera's customers have recession-proof portfolios, and if they don't, they're not going to let it show by dressing in any old thing. The show's color palette was of the ""If you've got it, flaunt it"" variety: bright persimmon paired with hibiscus, teal faille trimmed in tweed, a marigold photo print. Black and white also played starring roles. Compared to her recent collections, embellishments had been scaled back; Spring is all about the ruffle. As for the silhouettes, though, they were designed for cocktail hour and beyond (with a few exceptions for lunch at La Grenouille).</p><p>Herrera has always loved a skirtsuit, but this season short Watteau-back jackets in duchesse satin came with pants cut cigarette-slim and cropped several inches above the ankle—the effect was vaguely toreador. She showed enough dresses for a season's worth of dinners, art openings, and galas. There were pretty party frocks in mille-feuille chiffon that had the unstructured ease of silk lingerie. The ""important"" gowns came in corseted silk cloque or lacquered black raffia (don't even think of sitting down in that one). A beaded, liquid jersey column in white with a black gabardine jacket slung over the shoulders was the winner of the bunch, though, not only because it captured a certain effortlessness, but also because, yes, it looked wallet-friendly: The blazer could do double duty with a T-shirt and jeans.</p></div>"
38,spring,2009,s2009,catherine-malandrino,"It's been ten years since Catherine Malandrino founded her label. In that time, she's opened nine stores (with a new creative retail concept about to bow in Los Angeles), expanded categories to include accessories and home, amassed an ever-growing following, and, in short, built a solid fashion business. The designer optimistically named her anniversary collection ""Dawn."" As she's cleverly done for a few seasons, Malandrino stayed true to her crafty core with loads of tactile details for the eye to drink in, including scalloped lace, appliquéd tulle, and quilted leather. New for Spring, she explored the idea of layering fabrics—specifically a nude tulle over lace or satin—that worked nicely to add an interesting layer of texture. That said, a fishnet overlay fell flat. The designer is reissuing the flag dress she found fame with a decade ago, but it was another nod to Americana that provided some necessary wit here: a lace-printed silk gown featuring the Statue of Liberty.</p><p>Though it's clearly what her clientele responds to, Malandrino's craft parade can easily threaten overload, and it did so here with a backless jeweled top that seemed to be little more than a hunk of embellishment with straps, as well as a gown with a neckline of gob-stopper jewels. That's why one simple standout—a white pointelle gown—felt like coming up for air. A few more opportunities to do so might not be a bad idea.</p></div>"
39,spring,2009,s2009,celine,"Ivana Omazic had the thankless job of going through with a collection after it was publicly announced that Phoebe Philo would be replacing her at Celine later this month. Like her LVMH stablemate, John Galliano at Dior, Omazic said tribal traditions were her starting point, and like him she didn't take the idea too literally. There were Polynesian-tattoo prints on silk organza dresses, ""scarified"" supple leather pants, and Masai beading on skirts. She touched on other trends, too, including transparency. The rest (from the hand-painted crinkled-voile wrap dresses to the jersey separates to a couple of suits) looked like it could've come from a tribe called BoBo…as in ""bourgeois bohemian."" You can call it commercial, but you can't fault her for that—not when retailers are cracking jokes like, ""I have big news: We sold a dress!"" Yes, there were some missteps, starting with an overly conceptual wedge shoe that was missing an instep, but Omazic deserves credit for making the most of her unpleasant situation.</p></div>"
40,spring,2009,s2009,chalayan,"It takes an incredible designer to probe the live anxieties of this scary moment and yet still come up with a wearable fashion collection, and that person is Hussein Chalayan. His show literally ended with a crash: the live smashing of dozens of wine glasses lined up along a pseudo-bar inset in the back of the set. While that happened, the stage was occupied by a circle of girls standing on a revolving dais, wearing molded-latex dresses that appeared to be frozen in aerodynamic motion. Each dress was hand-painted with images of crushed cars.</p><p>""It's about the speed in our lives and how it can only result in a crash,"" Chalayan explained, adding that the prints, which included number plates, car handles, and fenders, were ""taken from pictures of car graves."" The extraordinary talent Chalayan has is his ability to project something emotionally and politically pertinent onto his runway without making it oppressively doom-laden. In this case, he ramped up the curiosity subtly. What was going on with those apparently airbrushed car-paint prints on those short, bonded-jersey minidresses? When other versions came out in printed chiffon, swirling with dark gray prints, they were all very beautiful—but were they also something to do with clouds of car exhaust fumes?</p><p>The clever part was that theoretical theatrics never got the better of the clothes. Among the more conceptual pieces there were clear passages of young, fluttery, blue-and-white striped T-shirt dresses, and a superchic one-shouldered black dress. In effect, it was a collection in which Chalayan demonstrated that he's reached the stage of maturity where his ability to articulate significant symbolism only enhances, rather than obscures, the excitement of his abilities as a fashion designer.</p></div>"
41,spring,2009,s2009,chanel,"Since it's not exactly feasible to invite people to view a Chanel collection in-house, as it used to be done, Karl Lagerfeld instead decided to bring the Rue Cambon to the thousand or so people who crowded into the Grand Palais. A life-size facade of the storied Chanel building at number 31—complete with a street runway—had been dropped into the space. The doors opened, ""Our House"" by Madness struck up on the sound system, and a line of Chanel-clad pedestrians streamed out.</p><p>It was a charming, expensive shot of celebratory fun rolled out with supreme confidence. Lagerfeld said the theme was inspired by a grayish portrait by Marie Laurencin, who painted Coco Chanel in the twenties, but really, it was yet another of his long, allusive, sometimes mischievous excursions around the house set pieces. The fact that there's an untainted core to this label—the tweeds, bows, camellias, and ineffably pretty cocktailwear—means Lagerfeld can take full license to nod to all sides of the road. So, within a relatively tight palette of black, white, and gray, he made free with current references to graphic checks (done in a painterly way on sleeveless suits), metallics and sheerness (in tissue-fine silvery pink lamé and crunchy, sparkly paillette embroideries), and lingerie notes (a bit of boudoir styling in marabou-heeled shoes and frilled negligee sleeves).</p><p>This, however, is far from an adequate précis of the multifaceted Chanel action on the runway. It encompassed jumpsuits and Empire gowns, flamenco-cum-western ruffled skirts, black ciré swimwear, and, in the middle of it all, a kitsch skit on the Chanel carrier bag: little shopping bags in pink leather. In the end, though, it was the delicious eveningwear that carried the show to a lovely conclusion: long, narrow skirtsuits with cropped boleros, a pink vertically pleated dress, and, yes, even a gray-tinted cloudy georgette flowing dress that could have sat for Marie Laurencin.</p></div>"
42,spring,2009,s2009,charles-anastase,"If Charles Anastase's latest collection looked familiar, that's because he decided to use his London debut as an opportunity to revisit the first collection he ever showed in Paris. So there were a lot of those high-waisted, mini-crini silhouettes that once made Anastase seem like Vivienne Westwood's most ardent disciple. And, just like the first time, his mother was responsible for the little cardigans that were layered over washed-out silk pieces in the palest pastels. The look had a dreamy languor, but the designer has always managed to stay this side of saccharine by adding twinges of disturbia. After all, he cites a Degas ballerina and Lolita as inspirations, girlish extremes of innocence and experience.</p><p>Those extremes were more obvious than ever here, where a crinoline floated over suspendered black thigh-highs, or silky fairy-tale layers were anchored by a tiny black leather biker jacket. The leathers highlighted a fifties ""bad girl"" subtext: a denim jacket with biker insignia, skinny jeans with a big red ""Charles"" appliquéd across the butt. Then there were the shoes, towering cork platforms rather than the usual ballet pumps. They added the element of unease to which Anastase is partial (""a little nightmare,"" he calls it). His approach to what it feels like for a girl is pretty close to Rei Kawakubo's. And by the way, that was Adrian Joffe, Mr. Comme des Garçons himself, in the front row.</p></div>"
43,spring,2009,s2009,charles-nolan,"This show is always an event, involving props (usually too many) and ""street"" casting. Best of the runway-novice bunch this season were Olympic swimmer Dara Torres and her toddler daughter, Tessa, and clubland legend Kenny Kenny, who made a convincing Dietrich. Broadly inspired by the ""creativity of the twenties,"" Nolan admirably avoided the costume trap (though it must be said that one of the best looks, a floral net blouson top, was the most authentically Jazz Age, as well as Daisy Buchanan-at-a-garden-party pretty). Nolan was also thinking a lot about travel—ergo the passports and maps carried by the models—and unfortunately let his focus wander a bit. He missed the boat with an out-of-character mod ensemble and some experiments with neon, but a pleat-back shift and a classic mariner top worn with cropped linen palazzo pants were just the ticket.</p></div>"
44,spring,2009,s2009,chloe,"How does it feel to be finally in charge at Chloé? ""Oh, it's heaven!"" exclaimed a tired but exhilarated Hannah MacGibbon, the 38-year-old blond British designer who assisted Phoebe Philo from 1997 through the label's red-hot early-noughties days. Her task is to heat it back up again after several tepid seasons and reconnect with that customer who would once spare no expense to get hold of Chloé's signature sexy-girly things, trophy bags, and shoes.</p><p>MacGibbon's scallop-edge coats, rounded-shoulder blouses, and high-waisted flared shorts, interspersed with ruffle-necklined dresses and jumpsuits with an eighties kind of gathered swell in the thigh region, certainly had an air of summery freshness about them. Her contrasts of chartreuse, beige, cream, bluebell, green, and a particular apricot (the exact shade that appears on Chloé packaging) were rinsed of any print and shorn of the embroidery that is a usual feature of the brand.</p><p>So was there evidence here that MacGibbon holds a key to the It-ness, the spontaneous, non-intellectual-girl knack that is central to Chloé? In this first outing, some signs were promising—one of the least weird jumpsuits on any runway (a dark green silk halter); a few great pairs of pants. The shoes, ankle-strapped flats and spindly high heels in mixed leather and shiny plastic (no platforms, hooray!), were the best pacesetters since the Chloé clog stomped out the door. And the color-blocked bags with gilt frames and chains had editors scribbling ticks and stars in their notebooks.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hlw8nu""></div></div><p>In this first collection, MacGibbon said she's aiming to ""cleanse the palate"" and de-complicate fashion for young women. That's going to take a while to evolve, and the designer must be given time to realign the brand identity amid our new set of economics, something Philo and she never had to worry about when they arrived at the house as twentysomethings. A bigger question is whether the company will see fit to steer Chloé back toward its origins as a prêt-à-porter label for seekers of fashion at accessible prices. At a time when ""no expense spared"" is fast becoming an anachronism, that would be smart.</p></div>"
45,spring,2009,s2009,chris-benz,"Chris Benz has built a solid reputation for himself as a designer who can take specific historical points of reference (say, a thirties starlet or an old French woman) and make them thoroughly apropos for today's girls-about-town. In the past, his specific brand of quirk has been love-it-or-hate-it, but a crowd-pleasing Spring collection should win him a broader fan base.</p><p>""I looked at Revolutionary War-era dressing,"" the young designer said, ""but interpreted it in supermodern fabrics."" There were a number of military jackets, sure, but done up in slub linen with an abstract chrysanthemum print and the muted-bright palette that's become a signature. Benz deserves props for his measured approach to femininity. A silk T-shirt dress with tiers of ruffles could have gone very wrong, but in his hands it looked very right. And while a parade of ripped and rumpled low-slung pants worn with boxer shorts felt forced, slouchy burlap engineer pants and silk two-toned trousers hit the nail on the head.</p><p>Instead of showing his clothes in <em>tableaux vivants</em>, as he has in the past, Benz mounted a full-on runway show at the 37 Arts off-Broadway theater. Though less atmospheric than his past venues—like the New York Yacht Club—it was also less of a precious gesture. An elaborate whitewashed and drip-painted structure of found objects (""this, like, temple thing we put together,"" Benz semi-explained) was the only set, leaving the audience to appreciate the clothes on their own terms.</p></div>"
46,spring,2009,s2009,christian-dior,"One of the subtexts of the moment is that so many people are looking back 20 years to the high eighties, when Parisian designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler, and Claude Montana were in the ascendant. (Coincidentally, Martin Margiela has a 20th anniversary this year, and Suzy Menkes has been celebrating 20 years at the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>.) John Galliano has had 1988 and all that on his mind, too, judging by today's collection, in which he cast his eye back to that glamazonian era of corseted waists, pointy bras, Lycra leggings, and body-conscious knitted dresses—a time before the models on his Dior runway were born.</p><p>It was clearly Alaïa and Gaultier in ""Tribal"" mode Galliano was referencing with all his short flippy dresses with sheer skirts, bodysuits, python jackets, spotty animal prints, and jutting bras. If there was nothing too discernibly Dior-esque here, the house's offerings were admittedly forgettable in those years—and anyway, the people Galliano seems to be aiming at this season will be too young to know or care either way. (Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is going to find herself pretty stuck for diplomatic daywear, though she might home in on an adaptation of the pink cowrie shell-embroidered evening dress as one non-sheer option to cover her for a state dinner.) Ultimately, there was no shaking off the impression that this collection lacked the creative fire of John Galliano at his best.</p></div>"
47,spring,2009,s2009,christian-lacroix,"For Spring, Christian Lacroix finally delivered the thing his ringside fans have been hankering after for ages: a collection that transmitted the fantasy of his haute couture into ready-to-wear. For the first third of this collection, at least, there was everything a young girl could dream of owning from the Lacroix canon: bejeweled toreador pants and capes, boned and beribboned pouf-shouldered dresses, frothy leg-of-mutton-sleeved Edwardiana jackets, sexy bustled skirts, and deliciously light-handed draped chiffon prints. All of that bounced onto the runway liberally strewn with the giant carnation corsages and artfully placed bows every Lacroix lover will recognize as his inimitable signatures.</p><p>Quite what has taken Lacroix so long to amp up the energy and polish in his prêt-à-porter is something of a mystery. Whatever's happened, there's apparently been a turnaround in attitude because a personal commitment to design seemed palpable for the first time. For one thing, the quality looked steeply improved. And for another, there was a much stronger handle on how Lacroix's look might be broken down for a young customer, who (for example) would rather wear a richly detailed tulle-shouldered corseted vest with a pair of slouchy pants than keep it strictly for some formal event. That the collection lost it slightly in the eveningwear among an overload of printed, draped mini dance dresses was a shame, but what Lacroix started on the runway this season was encouraging. He should take it full-throttle next time.</p></div>"
48,spring,2009,s2009,christopher-kane,"It takes a unique mind to watch <em>Planet of the Apes</em> and use it to start a fashion collection, but that's where Christopher Kane jumped off for Spring. He liked the apes' leather tunics. ""It was that, and then <em>The Flintstones</em>, Raquel Welch in <em>One Million Years B.C.</em>, and then Dian Fossey and her gorillas,"" he said. And, like all little boys, Kane loved playing with toy dinosaurs. Hence, the stegosaurus shoes.</p><p>Even his sister Tammy was incredulous at first. ""When he started saying 'prehistoric,' I said, 'What? I don't know what you're talking about.'"" But then the pair started work, and what emerged was an obsession with scales, which somehow morphed into half-circle 3-D geometric cutting in organza or leather, and even a bit of menswear fabric. Then he worked in bright animal-spot ""Flintstone"" cashmeres (made at Johnstons in Kane's native Scotland), photo-prints of Digit the gorilla, and finally, some suggestive marabou trimming on chiffon—a late thought about Peter Bogdanovich's <em>Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women</em> for that special borderline-tacky touch that always puts the finishing stamp on a Christopher Kane collection.</p><p>Overall, it was a deft move forward for a young designer who needs to cement an identity and prove something more than an ability to come up with a novel idea each season. The circle cutting, which held echoes of Cardin or Capucci, looked young and modern—and provided a direct link to the giant paillettes Kane used last season. When the scallops stood out to frame a shoulder line or run up and down a pair of skinny pants, they looked head-turningly new, though when they turned into conceptual bundles, the wonder wore off. The sweaters continued his signature in a bright, accessible way, and the gorilla prints, though patched into two structured cotton dresses on the runway, will also be available as easy-to-wear and well-priced T-shirt dresses. Kane's still a designer who can hit fashion sideways with a new idea, but there are signs that he's beginning to think of how to turn what he has into a brand.</p></div>"
49,spring,2009,s2009,collette-dinnigan,"There was a little black dress midway through Collette Dinnigan's show that reminded people who've followed her career of the early days. The frock's peekaboo-lace back echoed the lingerie-inspired dresses with which she made her name in the nineties. It would've been a good look upon which to build her Spring collection. As it was, it was just a (welcome) blip among many other pleasant but less distinctive dresses, some densely embroidered with metallic paillettes or studs, others cut in a filmy white chiffon with a violet butterfly print. Military touches on jackets struck a timely note, but there wasn't enough here to distinguish the clothes from those found in the contemporary collections seen on the runways of New York. In fact, that might be a good venue for this commercially oriented designer.</p></div>"
50,spring,2009,s2009,comme-des-garcons,"What is the future of black? That's the philosophical question Rei Kawakubo says she was pondering while designing her Spring collection. Since Comme des Garçons virtually invented black as the non-color of fashion in the eighties, that's probably a logical line of thinking for the woman whose original mind has such a widespread influence over generations of designers. Recent collections of hers have triggered outbreaks of bright, clashing, cartoonish color and multi-textured, perforated layerings that have been openly quoted by Marc Jacobs, and have trickled far down the fashion food chain.</p><p>But now Kawakubo is back to black, presenting it almost as a mathematical treatise in geometric volumes. Hexagonal cutting was the central motif, shaped into poufy geodesic tops and cocooning skirts. Using vinyl leather, she patchworked mini hoodies that looked almost like deconstructed soccer balls, and then started to add decoration: frilled edges on stiff plastic tectonic shoulder plates, transparent cellophane underskirts. By the end, a more organic feeling was breaking through: petaled tufts of tattered chiffon spreading over back-to-front jackets, and then whole dresses constructed like topiary. Underneath it all, there were wide shorts and regular trousers and flat lace-up shoes that offered a less experimental baseline for daily dressing. But did the collection end up answering Kawakubo's original question? That's something only she can know, and she's not one to spell out an insight. All that's certain is that she's set out yet another puzzle here that many designing eyes will be trying to figure out in seasons to come.</p></div>"
51,spring,2009,s2009,costello-tagliapietra,"They might be fashion's favorite cuddly, flannel-wearing bears, but this Spring Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra showed some claw. Their tough-on-the-surface collection surprisingly didn't include one inch of jersey, the drapey material on which they have built their reputation. ""We never meant for jersey to be our full brand identity,"" Tagliapietra protested. So what is at the brand's core, then? Feminine clothes, they said, that are ""body conscious—not in an Alaïa way, but one which caresses the body.""</p><p>The best pieces were made of washed silk charmeuse or georgette in exciting brights and color combinations the two haven't used before. (The ultrasuede pieces, particularly an ill-conceived and ill-fitting long skirt, were less convincing.) As they tweak their label's image, Costello and Tagliapietra said, they wanted to bring more of their own personas into the mix. They pulled this off with humor and much (nonflannel) plaid, which they whipped into sexy dresses, and by sending each of the models out with an initialed anchor tattoo inspired by the partners' own.</p><p>By contrast, their other stated inspirations—the seamy side of the seventies, sex clubs, <em>Scorpio Rising</em>, <em>The Night Porter</em>—seemed to be superimposed on the collection via heavy-handed styling: the leather cap, the suspenders, the Vaselined faces. OK, we get it. Harmless role-play? Sure, but it distracted attention from the clothes, which deserved the lion's (or in this case bear's) share of it.</p></div>"
52,spring,2009,s2009,costume-national,"Backstage, Ennio Capasa said he found a starting point for his Spring show in conceptual architecture: ""The kind of buildings that don't get built because there's no technology for them yet."" While that doesn't exactly sound like an auspicious beginning, there was nothing overly intellectual about the collection. In fact, it was fairly standard Costume National fare.</p><p>But this time, the body-conscious dresses and sharply cut suits with pushed-up sleeves and cropped pants were cut in crinkly, light-reflecting materials and built up around the shoulders for a slightly sci-fi look. The vest-jacket that's been turning up everywhere since Stefano Pilati showed one a year ago also made an appearance here.</p><p>Softening things up were fluid dresses airbrushed in black and white to evoke the reflection of the sky on buildings. The architecture motif continued into the accessories: Platform sandals with open metal heels evoked steel girders, and silver necklaces were made of interlocking 3-D rectangles. As far as visions of the future go, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it'll keep Capasa's fans in his clothes.</p></div>"
53,spring,2009,s2009,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley has had it with the frenetic pace of fashion. ""I love that we show collections so often,"" she said, ""but the addition of new seasons makes it harder to define each one."" And so, doing away with seasons altogether, she dubbed her show ""Collection One for 2009"" and—""because it's just a countdown until the next show""—hung a giant ticking clock as the set's backdrop.</p><p>Today's event—OK, then, we won't call it ""Spring""—was sleek and chic. Almost every piece was a futuristic take on the sheath, in heavy nylon with beaded ""armor"" appliqué, coated to add patina, or embroidered with mesh overlay. The glossiness carried over into the accessories: There were round, ring-handled Judy Jetson totes stitched from a high-tech material used to make life jackets, and oversize, slightly kooky gold-ball belts and bracelets.</p><p>This all felt quite new, coming as it did from a designer whose look is typically girlish and unstructured. There were a few misfires (one dress, described as having a ""gravity-defying back,"" just looked like a bad fit), but for the most part the modern lines and details worked very well. Here's hoping Rowley gets a chance to kick back and enjoy her success before she has to head back into the studio again for Collection Two.</p></div>"
54,spring,2009,s2009,cynthia-steffe,"Well priced and sweetly sophisticated has proven to be a profitable formula for Cynthia Steffe over the years, netting the label a diverse following and an impressive global distribution. Shaun Kearney took the design reins recently and, true to the brand's populist roots, today he offered something for most every girl, from sporty separates in techy lacquered raffia and high-gloss sateen to flirty crepe de chine dressed with smocked waists. Splashed on blouses and skirts, two prints played well off one another: a wallpaper floral in scarlet and aquamarine and a hypermodern stenciled lace. All told, Kearney's nicely balanced inaugural collection was a worthy first.</p></div>"
55,spring,2009,s2009,d-g,"It was anchors away at D&amp;G, where messieurs Dolce and Gabbana took a dip in the azure waters of the French Riviera. Make that a long soak. They never do anything halfway, and this collection was no exception, from the first retro navy-striped maillot with a red anchor on the chest to the parade of dresses in pleated gold lamé and chiffon printed with nautical flags and sailor knots. Over the top? Well, yes, but there was plenty in between that will play on dry land, including tailored blazers, high-waisted sailor pants, a ""gold-plated reptile"" trenchcoat, and thick, metallic-shot hand-woven knits, the best of which was a crewneck sweater worn with balloon shorts.</p><p>And because the Côte d'Azur was a stomping ground for Coco Chanel, who kept an iris-strewn holiday villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, the Chanel-isms abounded: little red-and-white-checked and sequined bouclé suits, but with shorts not skirts; a long, striped cardigan cum beach cover-up; twenties-feeling high-hemmed shifts; and a super-wide-brimmed sun hat straight out of a photograph of Mademoiselle herself. Fishnets, flag-printed wedge sandals, patent bags, and knit swim caps numbered among the other accessories. It was a kick from beginning to end, which is, after all, what Saint-Tropez fun in the sun is all about.</p></div>"
56,spring,2009,s2009,danielle-scutt,"Danielle Scutt wasn't lying idle while she took a break from showing last season. In her time out of the tungsten glare, she developed a thing for print and chiffon, and went to the West Coast of the U.S. for the first time on a <em>W</em> shoot with Bruce Weber. That set her off on an Americana-derived creative trail that had her hand-painting images ""inspired by a vintage Norma Kamali dress, Andy Warhol's <em>Interview</em> covers, Helmut Newton shoots, and hairstyles in eighties U.S. _Vogue_s.""</p><p>The result: checked, floaty georgette A-line dresses accessorized with beaded bandana necklines, towering updos of multiple knotted headscarves, side braids, hard lipstick, shades, and gold hoop earrings. Softer and more wearable this might be than Scutt's original tourniquet-tight collections, but it's still an image with a dangerous power about it: Unmistakably, this woman in her orange chiffon flying suits and cutaway bathing suits is no one to mess with.</p></div>"
57,spring,2009,s2009,daughters,"More eyes than ever before are trained on the husband-and-wife design team of Swaim and Christina Hutson, newly minted CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund nominees. Perhaps they were trying to shake off all that expectation with their Spring motto: ""Turn on, tune in, and drop out."" Or not. This was no Timothy Leary twirling-at-Woodstock-in-body- paint-and-patchouli scene. ""Communes,"" Christina said backstage, then wrinkled her nose. ""Well, luxury communes.""</p><p>The wardrobe inspired by these dreamy utopias came in a serene and sun-bleached prairie palette, with loads of tactile linens, chunky laces, and hand-knits that did indeed speak of the finer things. We've come to expect the duo—who, after all, were exclusively menswear designers until a few seasons ago—to tailor a perfect jacket and give it an edgy spin, and they delivered again by cutting them in austere linen and pairing them with high-waisted trousers and shorts.</p><p>With girlish Watteau-back baby-doll dresses and the ladylike coupling of tiny tees and poor-boy knits tucked into palazzo pants, the Hutsons are clearly itching to nudge their daughters out of the masculine/feminine nest. But while the newly feminine looks were quite beautiful, it's still the couple's more unique knack for subverting masculine classics that makes people sit up and stare.</p></div>"
58,spring,2009,s2009,dennis-basso,"East Coast blue-blood weekend places were on Dennis Basso's mind this season: Nantucket, Newport, and Southampton in the seventies, specifically—and the result was a rethink of that era's ""patio and terrace"" dressing, as he put it before the show. June evenings lounging on white wicker don't usually necessitate the furs Basso is known for, but he managed to work his calling-card pieces into the recipe by keeping them light and ocean-breezy. Russian broadtail boleros were ribboned with lace and worn over flouncy chiffon dresses in garden prints and shades of pink. There were a few too many flounces, but unexpected details, like a skinny lime-green python belt tied over a pretty batik dress, kept things fresh.</p></div>"
59,spring,2009,s2009,derek-lam,"After a brief side trip into Isak Dinesen-land last season, with its heavy lace, black net pinafore, and jet beading, Derek Lam was back on familiar ground for Spring: all-American sportswear with a languid attitude informed by his native California. A few days before his show, he explained that his dual inspirations were Coco Chanel in Venice circa 1939 and Venice Beach in 2009. ""I've been trying to understand what makes her, more than anyone, look so contemporary,"" Lam said. ""I think it's because she always looked natural."" With that as his mandate, Lam designed easy dresses with adjustable drawstring waists in white matte jersey and tangerine crepe de chine for day and copper lamé for evening. His suiting, too, had a fluidity of movement: Key looks were a slouchy pajama jacket with an asymmetrical scarf lapel that topped a camp shirt, loosely cuffed utility shorts and a nude vest, and an A-line tank and cropped cigarette pants combo.</p><p>Lam gave shout-outs to a couple of the season's emerging trends: makeup colors, for one, and jumpsuits for another. A black one-shoulder satin faille version that Lam dubbed a ""trouser gown"" captured the mood he was going for. He added some glittery beaded dresses to the mix, but unfortunately the collection as a whole failed to generate enough heat to keep his crowd interested.</p></div>"
60,spring,2009,s2009,derercuny,"In the four seasons she's been showing on the Milan runways, Mina Lee's Derercuny has undergone a metamorphosis, shifting from smart tailoring with subtle, memorable details to full-on girly mode. The collection keeps skewing younger and younger. For Spring, thinking one part hippie, another part glam, she laid the embellishments on thick: There were mirrored sequins on chiffon waistcoats and white feathers peeking from beneath the hem of a tank dress. A pair of stretchy cream leather pants worn with a pale, floaty floral-print chiffon top was a key look; it's what a prep-schooler might wear to pose as a rock chick.</p><p>Apparently Lee's label is a favorite among retailers, but there wasn't a U.S. department store bigwig in sight at her 9 p.m. show. The buyers must view the collection in the showroom, which might not be a bad place for the rest of us to take it in, too. The clothes are sweet and pretty, but they're not making news.</p></div>"
61,spring,2009,s2009,devi-kroell,"Why would an award-winning accessories designer add ready-to-wear to her already impressive résumé at exactly the moment economists are talking recession? ""I needed a new challenge, and, evolution-wise, this was the right moment,"" Devi Kroell said at Milk Studios, scene of her polished 23-look presentation.</p><p>Kroell, who first made a splash with her really big, really soft snakeskin hobo bag, put her passion for unique materials to work, shifting her focus from skins to silks. The neatly conceived collection was made of fabrics with a beautiful hand, inviting a good touch and feel. (Not that she entirely ignored unusual leathers: There was a knockout black-and-white shawl-collared sea-snake coat in the lineup, too.) Kroell managed to deliver on a promise too often made but too little kept: to carry a woman from day into night. Full-legged pants, bow-tied blouses, and a waxed-cotton trench fell on the office-friendly side, while a slightly bubbled peony-pink dress and a strapless back-trained black number—shown, naturally, with the perfect bag and shoes to match—tilted toward cocktails. ""There are a lot of disposable clothes on the market right now,"" Kroell said, ""but not many that you'd want to collect or hold on to. I want to create very luxurious clothes with a restrained elegance to fill that gap."" Blue-chip investments for the long-term? They always make good dollars and cents.</p></div>"
62,spring,2009,s2009,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg called her show ""Rock Goddess"" (and she had a couple of goddesses in her front row: Uma Thurman and Jennifer Lopez). But ""Flower Child"" might've been a more apt title for this breezy Spring collection, which, in contrast to Fall, consisted mostly of dresses. The models wore silk flowers and feathers strung from leather cords in their loose hair, and there were all manner of sixties standbys, from plissé wrap gowns and short tunics to a Saint Laurent safari dress and ribbed knits worn with denim flares. Everything was boldly colored, splashed with lush prints (often more than one in a single outfit), or trimmed in crystals and beads. Should von Furstenberg's hippie chick long for a touch of glam—a subject with which the designer is on intimate terms—there was a gold jacket and tuxedo shorts (worn, thank goodness, separately).</p><p>The overall effect was one of unbridled optimism. We could all use a hefty dose of that, and if it comes in the form of a flirty dress that gives us Aphrodite-like powers over men, so much the better.</p></div>"
63,spring,2009,s2009,diesel-black-gold,"Freja, Lily, and Isabeli stomped out to sarcastic lyrics by the Pierces—""Saturday night / We look all right / We're going out / Bo-ring!""—and that set the tone for a confident Diesel Black Gold show. Now in its second season, the line was launched as a higher-end addition to the Diesel brand, but the denim behemoth obviously hasn't forgotten what draws people to the label in the first place: quality jeans in unique washes and sportswear that cop a bit of 'tude. The coolest pieces for Spring were a leather biker vest and jacket with a destroyed, yellow-tinted finish, and bleached-out jeans with the original rinse color left as racer stripes on the seams.</p></div>"
64,spring,2009,s2009,dkny,"To mark DKNY's 20th anniversary, Donna Karan switched from her usual standing-room-only venue, the Stephan Weiss Studio, to Bryant Park, where bottles of sparkling wine (a custom DKNY and Chandon Twenty Year Cuvée awaited each showgoer). The proceedings began with a short film—not a navel-gazing look at clothes past, but more of a love letter to New York: jump-cutting footage of taxis, the Empire State Building, and subway signs, as well as, naturally, DKNY's gigantic building-side advertisement on Houston Street. Fittingly, the clothes that followed were more connected to streetwear than they have been in several seasons. Karan offered her take on the cool girl's uniform: an inevitably layered amalgam of boyfriend jackets, sporty parachute dresses in black pieced with neon, anoraks in nylon and denim, striped tees, and little skirts. Everything was topped off with tangles of subversive chains, skinny scarves, and high-heeled sneakers.</p><p>But all the mix-and-match soon became fashion mayhem, with too many ideas on display. Pulled apart, though, there are certainly clothes that DKNY's ever-growing customer base will flock to. Karan has every reason to smile beamingly, as she did while receiving well-wishers afterward on the runway: Though she didn't invent the concept of fast fashion, she unflinchingly embraced it 20 years ago when it was still an untested infant of an idea.</p></div>"
65,spring,2009,s2009,dolce-gabbana,"When it comes to throwing a glossy, high-spec runway performance, there's no one left in Milan who does it with quite the bravura of Dolce <em>e</em> Gabbana. They have their devices, of course, and they spell them out up front, leaving nothing in doubt: A preshow video named the collection ""Pigiama Barocco."" That meant classic gentlemen's silk pajamas, spotted or striped, with lots of bejeweling in the models' hair and on brooches, for starters. Big poufy skirts came into it, too, and tiered-lace cardigans, and then gilded brocades that took a sideways segue into some of those flat, exaggerated geometric constructions (big Minnie Mouse-ear sleeves, in this case) that are popping up all over.</p><p>Busy as this sounds, there was focus. At a point where most handbag displays have become lackluster, Dolce and Gabbana's literally shone, loaded with sequined embroideries and gold chains (a smart proposition for toting a purse as a piece of jewelry). For evening, the designers also nailed a couple more rising trends: mini-crinis in bouncing semi-sheer skirts, and sumptuously encrusted paillette embroideries. Finale-wise, it was all-out with romantic ball skirts studded with roses. In other words, not a whiff of economic anxiety was detectable within these four walls, and that in itself was curiously cheering.</p></div>"
66,spring,2009,s2009,donna-karan,"Elaborating on the effortless luxe of her Fall collection—you could call it bathrobe chic—Donna Karan sent out a slouchy, sexy, and provocative lineup for Spring. It consisted predominantly of dresses—draped loosely from structured shoulders, wrapping around the hips, short and slit up the thigh, or often all three. ""Liquid Assets,"" she called the show, and she chose fabrics with skim-y, languid possibilities like matte charmeuse and satin jersey. What Karan has done in the past for shoulders—one of her all-time favorite erogenous zones—this season she's doing for the décolleté. There were acres of it on display, and Karan's color palette of warm earth tones with accents of citrus and aquamarine was just as seductive.</p><p>The show's few hard edges came via strong-shouldered jackets, but even those were paired with liquid jersey tops that dipped low in front above crystal-studded miniskirts, as if you'd borrowed your husband's sport coat or trench for the short walk home from a late-night party. No, you won't be heading to the office in much of what Karan showed today, nor will much of it play in daylight hours. But what a vacation wardrobe it would be.</p></div>"
67,spring,2009,s2009,doo-ri,"Coming off a collection heavy on black and dense mohair knits, Doo-Ri Chung let the light in for Spring. Citing Bruce Nauman's <em>False Silence</em> installation as inspiration, she added decorative fluorescent piping to short dresses; the tubes hugged the torso, suggesting hourglass curves. Chung's electric color palette also took cues from the neon artist: A halter dress with ruching on the bodice came in an arresting neon pink, there were a pair of dresses in a deep emerald green, and a silk tie-front blouse came in brilliant navy.</p><p>Another way the collection felt light? Last season it seemed as if Chung had said good-bye for good to jersey, the fabric with which she made her name. But she brought it back today, and in its absence she had clearly been doing some thinking about novel ways to use it. Exhibit one: In jersey, the pants of the season—high-waisted, roomy through the hips and upper thighs, and tapering to the ankle—looked fresh and new. Likewise, Chung reinvented that up-from-the-streets item, the boyish vest, by showing it in a feminine bias drape. And as for her jersey dresses, she beat the been-there-done-that rap by playing with macramé overlays. Chung's steady-as-she-goes style is paying off.</p></div>"
68,spring,2009,s2009,douglas-hannant,"The large, tilted white disc of an Eric Javits hat that opened Douglas Hannant's garden party of a show wouldn't have looked out of place on Lisa Fonssagrives in a postwar fashion photograph by Irving Penn; the clothes that followed had a hint of the refinement of classic black-and-white Penn images, too.</p><p>Refinement for Hannant is a relative term, however, and the society-darling designer delivered froths of lace, tulle, and shimmer aplenty. Tanks and dresses with tulle racerbacks had a youthful nonchalance to them, and the gauze capelet that closed the show—worn with the opening to the rear—gave new meaning to the term ""sexyback.""</p><p>""I really took a gamble on this,"" Hannant said of his decision to show <em>au-dehors</em>, during a rainy week, on a sliver of rooftop at the Roosevelt Hotel. ""But it was key to see the clothes in the sunlight."" While a few well-lacquered guests looked at risk of melting, the gamble mostly paid off.</p></div>"
69,spring,2009,s2009,dries-van-noten,"It feels like the fashion crowd has waited all season for the other shoe to drop: the moment when some designer would muster the clarity to arrange a viewing of clothes any woman could look at and think, <em>Yep, I can see myself in that</em>. In Paris, it was Dries Van Noten who assumed the mantle of spokesperson for every woman's everyday wear. ""Accessible"" and ""pragmatic"" can sound like synonyms for ""boring"" in the lexicon of fashion-speak, but Van Noten's simplified solutions for urban elegance quickly put a stop to that kind of talk.</p><p>It was his marshaling of easy silk pieces that did it: breezy duster coats; shifts; and regular, non-freaky pants and shorts, pulled together with high heels, great jewelry, and sunglasses. As a look, it was a distinct move away from the layered, multi-printed, world-traveler groove he normally works. Restricting patterns to graphic grids, stripes, and checkerboards and color to black, white, and a section of orange, Van Noten subsumed the eclectic-ethnic effects into the jewelry and shoes: brass bells as necklaces, sequined tie-on wraps as bracelets, a note of ""African"" metal-studded craftwork in the ankle-strapped heels.</p><p>For day, that made the kind of sense women all over the world will get—and for evening, there was a stellar moment that distilled something that spoke directly to the tradition of rational American sportswear elegance that has gone missing in recent years: a white shirt tucked into a long, sinuous gold Lurex skirt. Strange that it's taken a designer from Belgium to retrieve the power of that simplicity, but it felt spot-on.</p></div>"
70,spring,2009,s2009,dsquared,"How to make your <em>Charlie's Angels</em> show stand out from the countless others that have come before? Hire supers Esther Cañadas, Fernanda Tavares, and Nadege to play Jill, Kelly, and Sabrina. The trio strutted out in long brown jersey dresses accented with topaz stones to surprised applause: Who were these grown women with real-life bodies? Cañadas' sultry swagger, in particular, received plenty of appreciative stares. If the Townsend Agency motif tempted Dan and Dean Caten to add some silly patent holster-harnesses to otherwise slinky floor-length dresses, they mostly resisted the urge to go kitsch. Instead, they focused on the all-American sportswear that they excel at, this time in a seventies mode. Among the strongest pieces were dark denim flares worn with crisp, checked oxford shirts and little leather bombers with maybe a silk scarf tied around the model's neck; a long, lean three-piece suit in Bianca Jagger white; and a floaty strapless gown with deep ruffles at the bust and hem. Of course, it wouldn't be Dsquared² without some skin, so there were also cutout swimsuits with gold chain details, but it didn't feel like the peep show that it sometimes has in the past. An oversize poncho and an enormous strapless bubble dress in duchesse satin were anomalies in what was one of Dsquared²'s most wearable collections in seasons.</p></div>"
71,spring,2009,s2009,duro-olowu,"In a London season that has been all about bright and brilliant color and print, Duro Olowu delivered a delightful visual overload of mixed patterns, luxe fabric, and tribal accessories. ""It's about being able to dream. Wearable fantasy,"" he said, looking for words to describe his unique African-Parisian take on chic summer dressing. His visual sources were the classic 1959 film <em>Black Orpheus</em> and West African masquerade festivals he saw in Nigeria as a child, ideas he patchworked into little suits, jumpsuits, and dresses; accessories with Cocteau-esque glittery eye brooches; tasseled necklaces; and sandals he found in Beirut.</p><p>What's interesting, though, is the way Olowu steers clear of any whiff of the hippie-boho: It's much classier than that. That's down partly to his use of vintage couture fabrics and partly to his knowledge of the way a certain slice of the cultural intelligentsia (including many Americans, like his gallerist wife) likes to dress. There's that—and his artistic way of seeing. Hard to think who else could get away with collaging lamé brocade next to black and white polka dots next to painterly flowers and checks—but in Olowu's hands, all that can go on in the space of one minute cropped gilet. That single hit of fabulous excess will function like a piece of jewelry to perk up any simple black dress.</p></div>"
72,spring,2009,s2009,eley-kishimoto,"There's always been something playful about Eley Kishimoto, so a soundtrack of frisky kids made a perfect intro to a collection the designers called ""Little Devils."" They traded on the notion with Peter Pan collars, smock tops, and princess coats, but Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto clearly have a grander design because they quickly moved on to the kind of outfits the parents of little devils might wear at their parties in the 'burbs. The Eley Kishimoto DNA was clearest in things like the floral sundress with matching stockings or a navy shirtdress with a pintucked waist, pieces that suggested innocence. But there was trouble once the middle part of the show—a group of oddly proportioned outfits in glazed raffia, or a sequined aboriginal lizard print—crossed over into attempts at worldliness. The designers pulled it back together at the end with swingy Art Deco chiffons in red, white, and blue—and the finale boasted a crash helmet in EK's signature zigzag that was a salutary reminder of their graphic genius.</p></div>"
73,spring,2009,s2009,elie-saab,"Watching a show by Elie Saab, who built his reputation on the backs of Hollywood's glamour girls, the question is always the same: Can you picture a celebrity wearing that? More often than not this season the answer was not likely. The Easter-egg color palette—hydrangea blue, lavender, daffodil, and apple green—will be the first stumbling block. Other obstacles include the outsize ruffles, awkward proportions on what few day looks there were, and fabrics and construction that just didn't look like the best that money can buy. Another issue: a sky-high slit that exposed one model's undies. Come to think of it, that dress may have a certain appeal for some of our starlets.</p><p>The pieces that worked came unsurprisingly from the silvery-gray portion of the collection: a short dress embroidered all over in metallic paillettes and a long stretch knit dress with a deep décolletage. Thinking more along those lines will make Saab's collection relevant to the likes of Dita Von Teese and Milla Jovovich, both of whom sat in his front row.</p></div>"
74,spring,2009,s2009,elie-tahari,"Standing under a palm tree in the Pool Room at the Four Seasons restaurant, Elie Tahari talked about why he had chosen Philip Johnson's landmark interior as his venue: ""We wanted to practice for a real fashion show,"" said the designer, who until now has presented his work not on a runway but in a showroom. ""Urban Paradise"" was the theme, but the collection, so ripe with bold, printed seventies-inspired Copacabana evening looks, was short on the citified daywear suggested by the first half of the title. It felt rather more like Resort than Spring: It's easy to picture bandeau tops, swim briefs, and ankle-tied harem pants at an island retreat, but in an office? Or, for that matter, lunching at the Four Seasons? Not so much. More in keeping with the Tahari tradition of trend- and work-friendly sportswear were a slim, sexy python-patterned skirt and a short, bright minidress (worn by Heidi Verster), both of which are sure to appeal to those Hampton Jitney-riding Manhattanites whom Tahari courts so well.</p></div>"
75,spring,2009,s2009,elise-verland,"Elise Øverland lightened up for Spring, tempering her goth/punk sensibilities with blush satin dresses, mint-green satin pajama suits, and a T-shirt shift with a wild bird print. Africa was the inspiration point, and yes, she did have the season's de rigueur droopy-crotch pant, not to mention a few silk veils-cum-hoods. But her devotees need not fret; there were still plenty of little leather jackets, second-skin leggings, and one super-cool sparkly black vest in the mix.</p></div>"
76,spring,2009,s2009,emanuel-ungaro,"Esteban Cortazar looked to his roots for his second Emanuel Ungaro collection. He dedicated the show to his father, Valentino Cortazar, and printed his dad's love letters to girlfriends on the runway. Then there were the leggy and bright clothes (not to mention the floppy Panama hats) that looked very much as if they were made for life in a hot climate—like southern Florida, from which he hails.</p><p>Cortazar opened with a ruched and ruffled one-shoulder party dress straight out of the Ungaro archives; the splashy florals he used for other little cocktail dresses also looked heritage. But elsewhere—somewhere among the tapered cargo pants, peasant blouses, and a knit poncho with fringe—he strayed a bit too far from Ungaro's sophisticated path. (On the positive side, he did prove he has a nose for trends: He showed his own vivid versions of the short-in-front, long-in-back dresses that have popped up elsewhere this week.)</p><p>Going forward in this troubled global economy, it's going to be all about big brands, or at least recognizable ones. Everyone is rooting for Cortazar—partly, no doubt, because he's so young to have been given such a big responsibility. He should retrench and come back with a collection that's less South Beach and more Paris.</p></div>"
77,spring,2009,s2009,emilio-pucci,"The press notes said Matthew Williamson looked to Capri for inspiration. The island, of course, was the birthplace of the house of Pucci some 40-odd years ago, but it's not entirely certain that its founder, Emilio, would have recognized this collection as a descendant of his own.</p><p>Yes, there were the signature graphic and swirling prints done up in shades of orange, pink, blue, yellow, and white, as well as beach-friendly caftans and bathing suits. But other pieces (a clingy minidress in a jungle-cat print with net insets and sleeves, a cropped jacket in a purple and aqua palm-frond print) had an eighties-by-way-of-a-Miami-club vibe that just doesn't seem to jibe with the house's more blue-blooded soul. Still, there were a few hits, including one allover sequined dress in an update of a house print. It didn't necessarily scream ""sixties Italian Riviera jet set,"" but it did look like now.</p><p>This show was Matthew Williamson's swan song: His three-year contract is soon to expire. Peter Dundas—who has worked for Roberto Cavalli, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Christian Lacroix (himself an alumnus of Pucci)—is up next. It'll be interesting to watch him try to whirl together a look that's respectful of the brand and yet new.</p></div>"
78,spring,2009,s2009,emporio-armani,"When Giorgio Armani began his Emporio Armani show two seasons ago with an ad for his fragrance, Diamonds, starring Beyoncé, the commercial interruption was diverting enough—after all, it was Beyoncé. The ad for the designer's branded Samsung phone that was screened before today's Emporio presentation? Less so. As for the bare-chested boys sporting enormous, (we're assuming) fake GA logo tattoos at the end of the show, they, too, were a distraction from a collection that had many strong points.</p><p>This is a season of easy, slouchy pants—a trend that Armani happens to have been perfecting for years. The leopard-print shorts worn over a trouser suit were a step too far, but there was nothing tricky about the washed-silk numbers that tapered elegantly to the ankle or ballooned above a deep cuff. Shorts with crossover waistbands also looked of the moment. In the jacket department, a cool, oversize tuxedo embroidered all over in crystals and a graceful ivory topper with a sculptural bow at the waist both stood out. The show's East-meets-West theme produced other jackets with mandarin collars, some of which were draped in multiple strands of beads and pearls. And vests turned up for both day and after dark, alternately topping long full skirts or narrow ones slit up the back. Things took a sweet turn when barefoot models strolled out in baby blue, pink, and yellow sequined gowns. Halter tops and ankle-scraping skirts in the same bejeweled tones were a more novel approach to evening, but they didn't have the same appeal as Armani's assured tailoring.</p></div>"
79,spring,2009,s2009,erdem,"""I just wanted something soft and hyper-romantic, easy but a bit surreal at the same time,"" said Erdem Moralioglu backstage. ""I've got all these images of seventies theater productions of <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, and Eton boys wearing flowers in their boaters.""</p><p>Whatever inspired him to push for all-out prettiness, and design a stunning lineup of dresses in French lace and dappled pastel-tinted watercolors of anemones and irises, it's clear things are working more brilliantly for Erdem every season. Take a tiered ice-blue lace Edwardiana dress with an orange ribbon clashingly threaded through it, or a sugar-pink high-necked organdy number with a 3-D smothering of ""a hundred hydrangea petals in the bodice."" The clothes, which also included a delicately washed-out pale blue ghost of toile de Jouy and almost sculptural zones of richly encrusted jeweled and frilled embroideries on sleeves and in deep hemlines, were breathtaking in movement. They made for a spellbinding show by an exceptional talent whose self-taught standards of workmanship almost put his creations on an equal footing with some of the things seen in haute couture.</p></div>"
80,spring,2009,s2009,erin-fetherston,"Much has been written about the beauty of the Paris skies, and for Erin Fetherston they were a constant source of daydreams…until her relocation to New York this year. An ""autobiographical"" designer by her own admission, she used this transition—and, specifically, a comparison between the light of each city—as the basis for her Spring collection. The theme played out delicately at first in a procession of relaxed, seventies-inspired sportswear (old photos of Lauren Hutton and Estée Lauder models had been part of the inspirational collage, too). Sequined flutter-sleeve blouses and linen trenchcoats shot through with metallic thread shimmered like sunlight across the Seine. Asymmetrical chiffon tops and jacquard bell-bottoms suggested she was pushing herself beyond the princess frocks she made her name with. But at last the dresses did emerge—unfortunately, as an all-too-literal look toward the heavens. Siri Tollerød appeared to be essentially wearing a cloud, inner tube-like, around her waist; and a trio of tiered ball gowns with voluminous ruffles and an ombré sunset print could be difficult sells for even the most die-hard Fetherston-frock fans. Still, we'd wager that as they left the venue, Peaches Geldof and Emma Roberts were replaying the earlier part of the show in their minds and thinking about which pieces they'd most like to take home.</p></div>"
81,spring,2009,s2009,etro,"Veronica Etro looked East for inspiration. In her vibrant lineup were a silk kimono print jacket and pants, as well as an Indonesian batik chiffon floor-length dress. But refreshingly, this wasn't an ""ethnic"" collection per se. It was more modern than that: Sari overalls (a.k.a. one-shoulder jumpsuits) mixed it up with silk pajamas in a seersucker blue and white stripe, and an Indian-feeling mirror-encrusted jacket was interspersed among an emerald green ombré sequin dress and a matching tank worn with rolled-hem shorts. Throughout, Etro made the most of her family label's heritage, reviving the signature paisley in a very pretty salmon and mint combination for several looks, including a billowy gown that parachuted behind the model as she walked.</p><p>There were a few wrong turns—a too boxy jacket with passementerie detailing at the collar, a similarly square white leather vest—but overall it was a big improvement over a Fall collection in which heavy-handed styling distracted from the clothes. In a season of prints, Etro's are subtle standouts.</p></div>"
82,spring,2009,s2009,fashion-fringe,"""Fashion needs fresh blood, and London is the most creative place for that,"" said Donatella Versace in the backstage VIP room. She'd just flown in to chair the proceedings at the Fashion Fringe competition in Covent Garden—this despite the fact that her own show is only days away. Why would she take the time? ""I always need to challenge myself as well,"" she said.</p><p>To rewind a bit, Fashion Fringe is the London competition conceived five years ago by the journalist Colin McDowell along the general lines of Simon Fuller's <em>American Idol</em>. Newcomers, who need to be domiciled in the U.K., are vetted by a panel of industry experts, then set up in studios, and helped to produce sample collections. During fashion week, they compete against one another in a press show, after which a single winner is announced. Erdem, Basso &amp; Brooke, and Sinha-Stanic are all Fringe alumni.</p><p>This time, the Korean designer Eun Jeong Hong took the prize for an all-white collection of tiered-lace pieces and Grecian tunics—an accolade that will propel her fledging label Go By A Secret Path to instant visibility. The other contestants, Sarah Easom (a talented print designer whose collection was inspired by exotic birds), LF Markey (whose stiff, color-blocked shapes were inspired by Elizabethan costume), and William Tempest (va-va-voom corseted dresses), may or may not surface again, but their varying tastes flag up the things young Londoners are loving now: full-on print, intense color, and eighties glamour.</p></div>"
83,spring,2009,s2009,fendi,"Exactly who started this season's trends for transparency, pale color, and bouncy crinolined skirts, we may never know. All that's certain is that it takes a practiced eye to handle all three of them at once—but if anyone can get away with it, it's Karl Lagerfeld. On the Fendi runway, he made bell-shaped dresses—with their accompanying three levels of sheer fabric in the skirt—look molded in a graphic way, rather than ingenue-cute or dubiously sleazy (pitfalls that have been encountered by others who've gone the way of see-through).</p><p>With that, Lagerfeld established a modernist, cinch-waisted silhouette, further de-cloyed by up-sprouting quiffs, that ran throughout the collection—and he cleverly dispensed broderie anglaise, tablecloth lace, and laser cutouts as he went along. It made enough of a statement to carry the show, but, as always, the real news-making content was the shape of the Fendi bags. This season, it's the ""kangaroo pouch""—vaguely similar to the Hermès Birkin, but with one side draped open.</p></div>"
84,spring,2009,s2009,salvatore-ferragamo,"Cristina Ortiz took a second stab at establishing a new identity for Salvatore Ferragamo today. Unfortunately, it didn't fare much better than her bumpy first effort. You could see that she was trying to manipulate elements of the house's accessories into the clothing: D-ring closures on suits, leather shoulder straps complete with buckles for dresses. She played a bit with classics such as the trench and the crisp men's shirt as well, turning the former into a strapless dress and the latter into a bustier with a wide leather belt below the bust. As ideas they were interesting, but in execution they looked tricky. As for her eveningwear, mostly plissé halter dresses with deep bunches of fabric at the waist and hips, the fit was not only unflattering but often poor; nipple slippage is one thing on the runway, quite another in real life.</p><p>It's not clear whom Ortiz is targeting with these clothes. They're far too racy for Ferragamo's classic customer, and yet not on-trend enough to woo new ones. If there was a glimmer of hope to be found, it was in her suits. There's still too much going on around the waist—and no one wants to add bulk there—but color choices like a pale lilac or the soft drape of a lapel betray an appreciation of the feminine that seems otherwise curiously lacking in this female designer.</p></div>"
85,spring,2009,s2009,francesco-scognamiglio,"As the kids say, Francesco Sconamiglio has mad skills. He can cut a lean, mean suit with the best of them—but he'll never graduate to the big leagues like his front-row pals Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi have until he turns down the kink factor. The show opened with a respectable-enough cropped ivory jacket; unfortunately, it was worn with see-through plastic trousers. The second look, a coat-dress with an asymmetrical neckline that purposely exposed one breast, was even more risqué. The blouses were lovingly crafted, with spills of ruffles at the throat or, more unusually, with shoulder pads made from feathers—but, again, because they were so sheer, their appeal will be limited.</p><p>A series of little white dresses (bracelet-sleeved, one-shouldered, or strapless, decorated with sculptural rosettes or ruffles) showed Scognamiglio at his best: just this side of flamboyant, but relevant at retail, too. When he starts thinking more along these lines, he'll start drawing the crowds that his technique deserves.</p></div>"
86,spring,2009,s2009,g-star,"Clothes have never been the main event at a G-Star show, so it's to the company's credit that this season they used their platform to make some noise on behalf of the United Nations Millennium Campaign to end poverty. Emcees Alan Cumming and Heather Graham opened the proceedings by outlining the campaign's eight Millennium Development Goals, drawing loud applause from the standing-room-only crowd at the Park Avenue Armory. And then, with a flash of light and a falling of curtains, the show began. Guests have come to expect a feat of stagecraft and choreography from G-Star, and they got it. Models in belted trenchcoats, fingerless gloves, and denim vests formed <em>tableaux vivants</em> on risers that lifted up from the stage, while others marched beneath them in serious-fun streetwear. It was a nice change of pace from the usual swish-and-turn maneuver we've seen so much by week's end.</p></div>"
87,spring,2009,s2009,gap,"""It's about you, not me,"" said Patrick Robinson at the presentation of his first real Spring collection for Gap since taking the creative reins last year. What Robinson meant was that his designs are meant for the customers to weave into their own personal styles—not for him to impose as a monolithic look. To that end, Robinson worked on honing and perfecting the staples at the label's core: khakis redone in silk and cotton jersey, fine-gauge striped cardigans, pocket tees trimmed with a spray of ruffled tulle, and slim rolled jeans, now in 20 colors. That's not to say the lineup was purely basic. He explored the still-fresh silhouette of wide-legged and flared pants worn with lean top halves—a T-shirt layered under a skinny vest or a fantastic, slightly sheer cotton tunic. A crisp white dress with a pleated neckline and lightly striped hem was exactly the kind of piece you'd love to own if only it wasn't obviously going to be so popular that you'll be seeing it all over town. Also of note was the bold, color-blocked swimwear; and certainly a knit boyfriend blazer, like a cardigan but polished enough to wear to work, is something that's never before seen the inside of a Gap store. Fans of the Pierre Hardy Design Editions sandals will be thrilled to see that every look was styled with a pair, now available in suede.</p></div>"
88,spring,2009,s2009,gareth-pugh,"The latest English enfant terrible to take his show on the road, Gareth Pugh, promised that his Paris debut would mix showroom and showpieces. In other words, commerce and creativity uniting to broadcast Pugh's business savvy on a much wider platform than London had allowed him. But if that implies compromise, forget it. The sonorous horror horns that announced the presentation suggested something wicked this way comes, and sure enough, Pugh mined the curious mother lode—Joan Crawford meets Predator—that he's established as his design signature. The exaggerated shoulder; the nipped waist; the articulated limbs, elbows, and shoulders projected to sci-fi points: all present and correct.</p><p>Post-show, Pugh talked about the duality of outfits that were all white in front, all black in back. The notion of emerging from darkness was his contribution to the irrational optimism of the Spring season as it has unraveled in New York, London, Milan, and now Paris. But there was also an inescapable subtext of protection in outfits with breastplates that jutted up over the face. The historicism that distinguishes the work of Central Saint Martins' brightest stars was evident in pieces that suggested the armor of a medieval knight. Elizabeth I's concertina-ed ruff exploded round one model's neck, down another's dress. There was a Victorian starchiness in pleated underskirts. But Pugh shoved all this history into a futuristic fantasy zone with a wrapped coat that looked like pixels, or a dress composed of vinyl petals like reptilian scales.</p><p>In the light of such eldritch constructions, it was funny to hear the designer talk about slashing vents into the clothes ""because this is a Spring collection."" That's what constitutes a commercial consideration in his extraordinary, hermetic world.</p></div>"
89,spring,2009,s2009,giambattista-valli,"It began with an austere high-waisted black tunic and shorts, and ended with the all-out extravagance of a thousand meters of multi-tufted tulle gown sweeping the runway. In Giambattista Valli's words, ""It's about a metamorphosis. There's a big change going on in these times."" He can say that again. Still, for the lineup of pretty young friends cozied up together center-front (Natalie Portman, Emma Watson, Lapo Elkann and his girlfriend Bianca Brandolini d'Adda, Leigh Lezark, Caroline Sieber, and assorted socials), this was a collection that outlined the go-to certainties of Valli's appeal: couturelike volumes and polished formality, underpinned by an irrepressible love of the frothy, feminine, partygoing dress.</p><p>Granted, this season the volumes were less overblown than usual, tempered (at least to begin with) by the influence of Cristobal Balenciaga in raised-waist sack dresses, ovi-form tops, and molded capes. More persistent, though, and shown in many fabric options—from faded and flaking wallpaper prints to guipure lace and hopsack—were fifties-style dance dresses, neat to the waist and flaring out into teacup circle skirts held up by stiff layers of petticoat. Valli attributed that to wanting to make his silhouettes correspond faithfully to his sketches. ""But in reality,"" he noted, ""you can take off the petticoat, and it's just a nice godet skirt."" Perhaps if he'd shown some that way, it might have injected the sense of modernity the collection ultimately lacked.</p></div>"
90,spring,2009,s2009,gianfranco-ferre,"Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi of 6267 have accepted a difficult assignment at Gianfranco Ferré. The esteemed Italian designer was no longer at the height of his powers when he passed away last year. So how do you update a brand whose identity gets a little fuzzy beyond the familiar paeans to architectural cuts and white shirts with a flourish? You certainly don't do it by committee, as the house's last two uninspired collections proved.</p><p>Speaking before the show, the incoming duo said they had looked at everything in the archives and were aiming to ""maintain the essence of Ferré while looking at the future, at what a modern woman wants."" They mostly lived up to those words. While there were several ""for photographic purposes only"" showpieces (including a sheath dress abundantly embroidered in plastic beads, discs, and paillettes), you could imagine many of the looks making the transition from runway to real life. Take the black column gown in marocain with sequined pagoda shoulders that Mariacarla Boscono wore to close the show. It was ruthless in its hourglass construction but seemed to meld to her curves, and absolutely nailed the ""rigorous softness"" that Aquilano and Rimondi were talking about backstage. Other examples: a scoop-backed black blouse with stiff-yet-weightless short sleeves worn with a ruffle-front camel pencil skirt, and a deceptively simple gray sheath that seemed to sprout white-tipped wings when the model turned.</p><p>The collection was based on geometric shapes: the circle, the square, the triangle. It's an idea that's gaining currency this season, but Aquilano and Rimondi did structure without forgoing everything that made the clothes feminine. (There were great jeweled belts and bracelets here, too.) They deserve high marks for this outing.</p></div>"
91,spring,2009,s2009,giles-deacon,"Is Giles Deacon getting a bit sensible? Put aside the giant pink <em>Pac-Man</em> figure squatting at the end of the runway for a minute—what he actually sent out was not one of his excursions into extreme whimsy but a collection of sheath dresses, the shape that's currently winning the popular vote among grown-up women everywhere.</p><p>Of course, this being Deacon, you wouldn't expect them to be delivered straight up and down without any tweaks of craftsmanship—or without skewering some insider pop culture references. Deacon declared those afterward. ""I was just looking at the graphic designers of the late eighties and early nineties who I grew up admiring: Ben Kelly, Peter Saville, Mark Farrow. Pet Shop Boys videos, The Hacienda club. What they did was ridiculously simple but incredibly graphic."" <em>Pac-Man</em> (the precursor of every modern computer game) dates from the same sort of vintage.</p><p>True enough, there were prints (giant allover camouflages and smudged polka dots), but Deacon kept them mostly to trimmings, or removed them altogether in a series of solid-color double-knit jersey dresses. And he endeared himself to his potential customers by using a broadened age group of models, including Emma Balfour, Elise Crombez, Liberty Ross, and Christina Kruse. He even popped in western shirts and a single pair of jeans, coming out soon as a collaboration with Lee Cooper.</p></div>"
92,spring,2009,s2009,giorgio-armani,"""This collection confirms a style that has changed the face of fashion,"" the program notes stated. That's not too bold of a claim when it comes from a designer like Giorgio Armani, the man who rethought the modern suit, then put his own sparklingly sinuous stamp on red-carpet wear. His Spring collection had both of those signatures in spades.</p><p>The show opened with elongated one-button jackets in traditional suiting fabrics. The ones that followed had a similar slight flare below the waist or a ruffle of pleats at the back, but they were made in fluid jerseys and shown with pleated and tapered silk pants, long shorts, or tucked-hem skirts. The wet-look hair and glistening makeup that was perhaps conceived to reinforce the show's breezy ""Joy to Wear"" message was too much of a good thing, but it was refreshing to see some big-name models on Armani's runway.</p><p>And speaking of big names, how fitting that Cate Blanchett was in the audience today: Armani has no better emissary for the sort of body-skimming beaded stunners in which he specializes. He sent out one-shoulder cocktail dresses and wispy chiffons in soft pastels, but they were just an opening act for his finale: a parade of beaded and embroidered long dresses that glimmered without veering into glitz. Had the timing been different, Jessica Stam's strapless number would certainly have surfaced on the red carpet at last night's Emmys.</p></div>"
93,spring,2009,s2009,givenchy,"Riccardo Tisci has won his spurs as the kind of designer whose shows cause mob scenes backstage in Paris. The push-and-shove to congratulate him after his show almost brought down a dividing wall—and to be honest, there's not much of that old-school mania around these days. What triggered it was a collection Tisci described—among flashbulbs and kisses from French celebrities and LVMH executives—as ""Western Bondage.""</p><p>There is a thread of hard-core hip in Paris that is picking up that western theme and turning it in a glam-slam direction that flies in the face of recessionary caution. Christophe Decarnin at Balmain is in that posse, too, and there are parallels in London among grittier designers like Meadham Kirchhoff. At Givenchy, the look came out in full force two-thirds of the way in, when the leggings took over—half-leather chaps, half-jeans, or skintight black Lycra with white leaf appliqués flaming up the sides.</p><p>Admittedly, that's the kind of sight that may frighten the horses in a nervous retail period. Yet fashion also needs the young and the brave to stir things up, and anyway, Riccardo Tisci was careful not to go the whole hog here. His route to the American West has been followed gradually, via Mexico, where the gaucho/Catholic references from his much-acclaimed collection of last winter originated. Something of the lace (now shown veiled beneath semi-sheer dresses) and the frothy white shirts of that collection carried over into Spring, the shirts perked up with gold bows and diamanté brooches in the shape of sheriff's badges. As for the bondage? It was mostly left to crisscross openwork back views, which will presumably remain strictly ""editorial."" No chance that will be the case with the thigh-high cowboy boots, though. Crazed lines will be forming for those overnight, recession or no.</p></div>"
94,spring,2009,s2009,graeme-black,"The show notes invoked the wild romance of the Hebrides. Seagulls cawed and waves broke on the soundtrack. The scene was well and truly set…then Graeme Black proceeded to offer 40 or so outfits that finessed his inspirations into sophisticated stasis. The first passage was a gown that fell from the throat in a snowy white cascade, a pristine sail that would never see sea air. If the little jacket—basket-woven from strips of leather—had done a better job of evoking the Scottish fisherman's net that was Black's starting point, it might have had more charm than the anonymously luxe finished product.</p><p>Black has clearly mastered the art of dressing Milan's haute bourgeoisie. That is, after all, the city where the former Ferragamo designer found his fortune. But while there's no faulting his level of craftsmanship, there was something stiff about the clothes, even with a white cotton ruffle on a jacket pocket (well, that was fussy, not stiff), or chiffon ruffles cascading round the dip of a blouse's back. That shirt was paired with a pencil skirt, a silhouette that cropped up a few times. So did doubled gowns, where a sail of fabric floated over a body-hugging column. At least the movement suggested whitecaps whipping in the wind. In the context of Hebridean inspiration (rope coiled on old fishing boats, mercury seas, sculptural rock stacks—Black can certainly turn a phrase), the gold sequin disco jacket was a discord, but it was the liveliest thing on the catwalk.</p></div>"
95,spring,2009,s2009,gucci,"Frida Giannini is from a different generation than Milan's other female designers, and she sees fashion from a more pragmatic standpoint. Gucci now is a clearly segmented, businesslike collection with no pretense of being anything other than hip, immediately understandable clothes for a young global audience. The time for runway fantasia has passed here, so even though Giannini named her Spring show ""Gucci Exotica,"" she made sure to balance realistic streetwear with the beach-babe bikinis, tropical prints, and filmy disco dresses—while, of course, underlining the vital bag news of the house: an up-sized, slouchier, hand-stitched ""New Jackie,"" and a utilitarian backpack that transforms into a carryall.</p><p>Since her first collection, Giannini has always included a boyish suit with a narrow ""Frida pant"" somewhere along the line. In this show, it came to the fore as an unmissable Gucci signature. Topped with a mannish straw fedora, it opened the show in pale blue and then reappeared in heavy rotation with mini caftans in cobalt, aqua, khaki, and then purple. Another central plank of Gucci's identity is the neat deluxe leather jacket. This season it reappeared as python bikers and vests, marking a scene shift into safari suits and gold-zippered military-cum-cargo looks. As is the house tradition, the lights then went down and up again and out came the finale gowns in filmy bluish-green prints or draped jersey. It wasn't a season to lift fashion to places it's never been before—more a careful ticking of all the Gucci boxes. These, after all, are risk-averse times.</p></div>"
96,spring,2009,s2009,haider-ackermann,"Haider Ackermann is one of those Paris designers who perpetually operates just under the radar. He's been around for at least half a decade, but for those who haven't seen one of his collections in almost as long, here's a message: Take a new look. Ackermann has a soigné way with the simplest of materials. He can drape humble cotton jersey into a twenty-first-century Vionnet, and what he does with leather could make even Rick Owens envious.</p><p>Second-skin leather jackets with the sleeves rolled up way past the elbows formed the basis of his collection; they unzipped in sinuous diagonals across the torso and clung to the models' every curve. Satin dresses were similarly cut in spirals, their zippers winking open at the waist or the hips to flash a bit of skin. The highlight of the show was a pair of diaphanous silk dresses shading from black to violet to midnight-blue like a stormy night sky. If there's a criticism to be made it's that Ackermann still hasn't found a way to replicate the swirling sexiness of his jackets and dresses in pants form, but when everything else looks this beautiful, that can be forgiven.</p></div>"
97,spring,2009,s2009,halston,"Despite the mixed reviews Marco Zanini received at Halston last season—and his subsequent departure—all reports indicate that the collection he designed is doing quite well at retail. Women, it seems, were hungering for the twenty-first-century spin he put on Halston's sexy brand of simplicity. So it was rather disappointing to see the straight-from-the-archives reproductions that the nameless Halston design team trotted out for a splashy presentation at the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>The museum was made over to resemble Halston's Paul Rudolph-designed townhouse, complete with gray carpeting, white walls, and gray upholstered seating upon which the models lounged. Too bad. Halston's minimalist creations were all about movement—the way jersey cascaded down your hips as you walked, or chiffon billowed in your wake—and there was just no appreciating that kind of thing when the girls were practically supine.</p><p>What one did notice were the colors—the putties, mauves, and dusty lilacs, as well as bright red, yellow, poppy, and pink, along with one vaguely tribal print. The collection's focus was eveningwear, but scattered among the scarf dresses, caftans, and one-shoulder numbers were a trenchcoat and a shirtdress in washed silk. Will these clothes resonate with shoppers like Zanini's have? Hard to tell. But it's a good bet that without a designer, and a designer's perspective, the label itself will quickly fail to interest the fashion crowd that came out to see it today.</p></div>"
98,spring,2009,s2009,hanii-y,"The current economic climate does not make it easy to grow a high-end label, so it's wise of former Y &amp; Kei designer Hanii Yoon to instead focus her efforts on contemporary line Hanii Y. Now based in New York City, Yoon drew inspiration for the current season from the white summer nights of Denmark, a disorienting phenomenon that, in her mind, led to a blurring between light and dark, reality and dreams. This translated into a sporty but refined collection of folded-pleat skirts (in gauze and printed cotton) and short-sleeved coats—a leather trench and puff-sleeve cotton car coat were both strong. The blurring also took the form of a masculine/feminine play-off, which worked well in a thick cotton anorak with matching Bermuda shorts, but fell short in the form of a tuxedo jacket with organza sleeves. Now that it has Yoon's complete attention, there's no reason Hanii Y shouldn't continue to prosper.</p></div>"
99,spring,2009,s2009,helmut-lang,"""A coming together of nature and the city,"" is how Nicole Colovos described the work she and her husband, Michael, did at Helmut Lang this season. Basically, it was a continuation of their exploration of organic shapes for Fall, only this time it was—in Colovos' words—""juxtaposed with architectural elements.""</p><p>Lang staples like sleek jackets were given a tuxedo cut and left sleeveless; trousers were slouchy in draped twill or silk, mostly with narrow cuffs. Oversize tees and tank dresses had moody black-and-white prints of marble, pumice stone, and—in a first collaboration for the brand—macabre spider designs by the British artist Jessica Albarn. One arresting material was a paper-thin leather with cobweb burnout used for jackets and dresses. This was a cohesive collection with enough casual cool to appeal to those who loved Lang back in the day and those who are just beginning to turn their eyes toward it since the brand's relaunch two years ago.</p></div>"
100,spring,2009,s2009,hermes,"It was only a matter of time before all the fringe we've seen this season went West. Sure enough, it was down to Jean Paul Gaultier to rustle it up in full buckskin glory, across the cactus-strewn desert sands of the Hermès runway. Naturally, this cowgirl is quite the chicest, classiest example of her kind ever to don a Stetson, and her fringe-swishing posse was led out by none other than Stephanie Seymour and Naomi Campbell.</p><p>Only a branded thoroughbred as sure-footed as an Hermès filly could possibly tread this trail with such a sense of fun. The kitsch risk was high, but Gaultier made it look natural: Hermès = equestrian heritage + sophisticated world traveler, after all. His quick mind for the crossover pun also found a way to twist the classic house scarf as a bandanna, and even to tame a poncho to supreme elegance, rendering it in square-cut cashmere knits and slinky jersey day dresses. And the accessories were all-out amazing: soft suede riding boots, mirrored aviators, driving/riding gloves, slim crocodile envelope clutches, handheld canvas-and-leather suitcases, and (whoa, ladies!) even a fringed Birkin.</p><p>If the Mexican striped-serape section (with cigars) went a bit too far, Gaultier reined in the references in good time to ensure that the after-dark etiquette of the Elysée Palace wasn't thrown into disarray. Take off the hat and strip away a bit of bandolier leather-work, <em>et voilà</em>: long, sinuous deep purple or green gowns with Madame Sarkozy's name stamped all over them. Result: Even if the luxury-goods gold rush is tailing off elsewhere, there's no sign of an end to the stampede for Hermès classics (fringe-wear or no) on the horizon.</p></div>"
101,spring,2009,s2009,herve-leger-by-max-azria,"Sex on heels is probably an accurate description of any Hervé Léger show: They invariably consist of second-skin dresses that make it hard to sit down. But this season's was even sexier. How? The finale consisted of a rapid-fire assault (complete with wardrobe malfunction) of bandage/bondage bathing suits guaranteed to raise temperatures, and not intended to come into contact with any liquid other than the sort served in a tall glass by a muscle-bound cabana boy.</p><p>Lou Doillon, Joy Bryant, and Maria Sharapova were among the crowd gathered to see Max and Lubov Azria tweak the band dress. What else could the designers do when the brand is so synonymous with one look? The Azrias' main conceit was to create optical illusions through pattern placement and color gradients. (They also showed dresses and jackets in airbrushed leather, which were rather reminiscent of some of Jonathan Saunders' print work.) Seeing as how the signature Hervé Léger look has been popular practically since the days of Cleopatra, this was clearly a case of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""—though, unavoidably, it did become somewhat repetitious.</p></div>"
102,spring,2009,s2009,house-of-holland,"""It's all about <em>Beverly Hills, 90210</em>. I bought a box set of the first series—1991, not the new one,"" declared Henry Holland of his collection, ""Sex, Lies, &amp; Volleyball."" Holland is a guy with a neat turn of phrase, a nose for the cute reference, and a knack for focusing the energy of a friendship group (who doesn't know his best mate is Agy Deyn?) into a now internationally recognized London phenomenon. Does this make him a designer of the class of Christopher Kane and Marios Schwab, who came up at the same time as him? By no stretch of the imagination. This is purely a pop-slash-club teen thing, and as cheerful, upbeat, and funny as Holland is, he's not about to change the face of fashion.</p><p>Liberally spattered over T-shirts, cycle shorts, and chiffon blouses, his polka-dot, hydrangea, daffodil, and rose prints looked exuberant. In the end, though, they were overshadowed by the jeans Holland has cooked up with Levi's—either polka-dot printed or with the dots laser-cut into the fabric itself. It's a smart collaboration, and even if his main collection isn't much more than a few simplistic, hyper-colored pieces, the opportunity to contribute cool ideas to a giant denim brand looks like a smart hedge against an incoming mood that's certain to be less tolerant of amateurism</p></div>"
103,spring,2009,s2009,iceberg,"It was the eighties all over again at Iceberg—the big-shoulder, big-attitude eighties. There was a little bit of Azzedine Alaïa in a black bra top with crisscross straps and a lean, curve-loving skirt with scuba seaming. And you could see shades of Norma Kamali in a short-sleeved blazer or a pair of ruched leggings worn with a cropped, kimono-sleeved jacket.</p><p>Breaking up the black, beige, and wine-red palette (and the sexy, take-no-prisoners vibe) were a couple of polka-dot knit dresses and a quirky print that looked like Jeff Koons' <em>Balloon Flower</em> and <em>Balloon Dog</em> sculptures. The magenta-and-blue print showed up on one of the round-shouldered jackets, a fitted sheath with an asymmetrically wrapped bodice, and a strapless dress with a fluttery hem. Sure, the eighties are big this season, but in a collection that otherwise inspired a serious case of déjà vu, the balloon print, at last, was something we'd never seen before.</p></div>"
104,spring,2009,s2009,iris-van-herpen,"<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-couture/iris-van-herpen#all-seasons"">Iris van Herpen</a>’s work is driven by her need to give ideas form, and the balancing act between intangible concepts and materiality lends her creations a certain frisson. That was especially true of her Spring 2009 collection. “Will there be a time when clothing is unnecessary and that something as intangible as smoke could be ‘worn’ on the body?” is the question she set out to answer.</p><p>Though Van Herpen’s quest was esoteric, it originated with the observation of the quotidian: ordinary refinery smoke, which, as it darkly billows out of the cigarette-shaped stacks of sprawling factories, is ethereally beautiful and sinister. Both attracted and repulsed by this industrial byproduct, Van Herpen, as her show notes revealed, aimed for her clothes to trigger in the audience “this mixed feeling . . . by manipulating the unpleasant industrial material metal mesh into something soft and lively.” Grounded by clunky platforms and dressed in cloud-like pieces made of a thin metal gauze or superfine thread with metallic shimmer, the models seemed to exist halfway between heaven and earth.</p></div>"
105,spring,2009,s2009,isaac-mizrahi,"Busy bee and social butterfly Isaac Mizrahi presented a buzz-worthy show at Hammerstein Ballroom today. This was achieved despite the frankly bizarre lighting scheme, which was meant to refer artily to emergence (as an insect from a cocoon or chrysalis, apparently) but that made the audience look jaundiced and the clothes colorless for two-thirds of the runway.</p><p>The clothes, however—once we got a clear look at them—were extravagant and beautiful. A lacy crochet dress was as fine as Queen Anne's lace; a pair of sequined dresses, amusingly named ""Glamourpillar"" and ""Glitterpillar,"" were Hollywood knockouts; a Cicada strapless number fit the body like soft armor. There were a few nods to Cristobal Balenciaga throughout, as well as to Mizrahi's own legacy. (Back again, for example, were deconstructed bustiers similar to the Mizrahi design that made it onto a 1998 <em>Vogue</em> cover, but more transparent this time, and worn with a pencil skirt or under a delicately shredded chiffon Moth jacket.) Though borrowed from the past, these looked topical rather than retro. Sure, there were some gadfly looks in the mix—exposed shoulder pads, neon biker shorts, a few odd pant silhouettes—but they were minor, gnatlike irritants. Overall, Mizrahi captured his audience in an enchanting, gossamer web.</p></div>"
106,spring,2009,s2009,issa,"The front row wedged tight with actresses, heiresses, princesses, and the Dellal women immediately had the antennae twitching. What has Daniella Helayel been doing to snare such a constituency? One thing was immediately obvious: She hasn't been making too many demands on them. The Issa show offered a random grab bag of easy, fluid shapes in light, floating fabrics. The parade of girlishly sweet white dresses at the finale were Helayel's ""lucky"" dresses—her best-sellers—and they looked prepped for partying on Copacabana come New Year's Eve. That's what Issa is all about—feel-good clothes for the live-fast set.</p><p>A broderie anglaise smock top, a royal-blue peasant dress, or a poufy-sleeved chiffon gown with an elasticated neckline somehow suggested something Zorro's gal pal might wear. Issa's roots are, after all, Latin. But Helayel also laid on an international gloss: a white halter-neck jumpsuit, a silver silk skirt with a banded knit top in the same shade. And was that the skort beloved of Marc Jacobs? As Helayel made her way down the runway at the show's end, the Issalites cheered. The secret of her success may simply be that she lives their life, knows their needs—and that's a business right there.</p></div>"
107,spring,2009,s2009,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel's clothes never looked as good as they did at the Chelsea Art Museum today. The designer opted to showcase his ""labors of love,"" as he called them, in a presentation format rather than on a runway as usual. That way, everyone could get up close to examine the undeniable art of his dressmaking—which, after all, is what customers fall in love with and open their wallets for. Other designers could learn from his example.</p><p>With the change in format came a new and welcome lightness. Fur coats and vests, nearly as thin as fabric, were detailed with satin piping. Fresh, too, was the cloth outerwear, done in colors like cinnamon, poppy, buttercup, and rose quartz, and worked with all the delicate finesse of a beautiful J. Mendel gown.</p><p>""My dresses are, in fact, like a flower,"" said the designer, who had been looking at the hyper-vivid petals and stamens of the botanical photographer Christopher Beane. Well, better make that an orchid—because, let's face it: This collection aims at an exclusive audience. But as today's presentation proved, it's not a rarified hothouse atmosphere that draws customers to J. Mendel dresses or jackets but the skillful hands that make them.</p></div>"
108,spring,2009,s2009,jaeger-london,"The Jaeger London label is a snapshot of the upper level of the aspirational British high street—the middle England middlebrow, middle-aged taste of the nation. As such, it's not a designer collection but an update on commercial perennials: this season, a seventies hippie-slash-safari, ethnic-y print vibe made sensible for a woman who works and attends dinner parties. (Surprise point here: After a year of freaking out most normal women, the harem pant is now safe for the mainstream.) Otherwise, Jaeger's patchworked, piped tailoring picked up a distinct hint of Proenza Schouler, and the flower-sprigged voile dresses something of a Celia Birtwell feel.</p><p>It was fine, but the very presence of such a collection on the official London schedule will be under scrutiny next season, when the city's show dates will be truncated from six days to four. Most high-street stores (other than Topshop) present their wares after the show cycle, and that's perhaps where Jaeger ought to fit. In any case, it's a position the label's owner, Harold Tillman, will have to think about particularly long and hard. His other job is chairman of the British Fashion Council, the man charged with protecting the interests of the young designers who will be competing for dwindling show time next February.</p></div>"
109,spring,2009,s2009,jasmine-di-milo,"Jasmine Al Fayed has apparently decided it's time to get serious. Six seasons in, she's traded her party-dress formula for a new focus on tailoring. Her jackets, with their slightly eighties shape (elongated torso, strong shoulder, scrunched-up sleeves) felt very now, as did a lounge-y pair of genie pants and a loose-legged satin jumpsuit. But it was hard to find an organizing principle for much of the rest—from a macramé maillot with dangling fringe to a floor-length T-shirt column to a strapless baby doll with a sweater tied over the shoulders—beyond the models' curly, bright orange wigs and mirrored shades.</p></div>"
110,spring,2009,s2009,jason-wu,"Since he launched his label three years ago, it's seemed as if Jason Wu has been auditioning to replace Oscar de la Renta or Carolina Herrera. He certainly has the immaculate Park Avenue thing down cold, should either of the legends decide to step down. But for Spring, inspired by a trip to Japan, where his business has been growing like gangbusters, Wu added an element of quirky whimsy that should broaden his appeal beyond the young ladies-who-lunch set. It came through in the form of a fuchsia cashmere T-shirt worn with an embroidered, dotted micro-pleat skirt, and again in the mix-and-match neons of a cardigan, a bow-front blouse, and a full A-line skirt. Not that the designer skimped on the ladylike numbers upon which he's built his socialite client base—French knot embroideries and Swarovski crystals decorated a white silk faille coat and a creamy organza dress, both of which erred on the prim side of polished. For the money, a fits-like-a-glove black-on-white floral tapestry sheath was a standout. The evening gowns in jewel-tone chiffon that closed the show successfully walked the line between Wu's two worlds. You could imagine an Olivia Chantecaille, who sat in his front row, wearing the emerald green dress with diamonds and heels, but the right downtown girl could also pull it off with flat sandals, a stack of gold bangles on both wrists, and a tan.</p></div>"
111,spring,2009,s2009,jean-paul-gaultier,"A trio of modern dancers opened the Jean Paul Gaultier show. Reprising her <em>Riverdance</em> moment from Fall 2007, Coco Rocha joined them for a few Martha Graham flourishes before stalking by in a fuchsia dressing gown that, once she unwound the straps, revealed itself to be a leotard. Rehearsal was the designer's ostensible theme. The models pinned their hair up under head wraps and wore all manner of warm-up clothes: There were <em>A Chorus Line</em> shirts wrapped around the midriff and tied in the back over high-waisted jersey pants with suspenders, a soft-looking white tracksuit, and, in a not-to-be-tried-offstage combination, flaring lace pants under leather briefs.</p><p>After a short interlude of suits, things took a more showgirl turn with Gaultier reprising one of his go-to motifs: innerwear as outerwear. A chain-mail halter topped a tattoo-print tank and panties set, and a green roomful of silk slips traipsed out, accessorized with a great-looking leather trench, a Mongolian lamb boa, or a fur stole. That stole's four legs and the dance troupe notwithstanding, this was one of Gaultier's tamer collections. It felt more like an exercise in styling than a tryout of new ideas.</p></div>"
112,spring,2009,s2009,jenni-kayne,"Jenni Kayne kept things easy for Spring—understandable for a young woman about to give birth to her first child. But that doesn't mean she was about to give up on elegance. Scouring the annals of eighties and nineties power dressing, she skipped the shoulder pads but captured the mood with boxy tanks and splashes of acid hues. A surprisingly lightweight tube mini awash in gold paillettes looked fresh paired with a denim chambray button-front shirt cinched with a leather belt, and a black linen bandeau worn under a must-have deep-V cardigan was a nice alternative to a camisole or a tee. Kayne, who missed the presentation in anticipation of her due date, may not have been designing with the average first-time mom in mind: Most of them put the bandeaux and minis on hiatus around the time of their last girls' night out. But the mostly effortless pieces she showed should be welcome in the closet of any unfettered young woman with time on her hands to devote to the pursuit of chic.</p></div>"
113,spring,2009,s2009,jeremy-laing,"The work of Argentine artist Lucio Fontana was the jumping-off point for Jeremy Laing's Spring collection. Laing referenced Fontana's monochrome, slashed canvasses by taking the knife (OK, shears) to his clothes, creating precise, controlled slits and slices in dresses and shells. The slits served a functional purpose in one charmeuse tube dress, expanding as the wearer moved so she wouldn't be hobbled as she walked. This dress, like others, was layered with a wispy chiffon ""tank"" that provided, at best, an unusual cobweb effect. At worst, it looked a little witchy (<em>Edward Scissorhands</em> also came to mind). On their own the dresses were quite pretty, especially those subtly studded with Swarovski crystals; most of the chiffon pieces were layered separates. Several day looks with a clean, geometric appeal—including a cropped nylon top with a low, rounded back that managed to look both sporty and conceptual—were proof that, all in all, Laing's shape-based construction served him well.</p></div>"
114,spring,2009,s2009,jil-sander,"What is it about the twenties that is playing on so many designers' minds? For Raf Simons at Jil Sander, it was the moment the Parisian avant-garde discovered African art and gave birth to modernism: Simons referenced this by projecting a Man Ray photograph of Kiki de Montparnasse cradling an African head sculpture onto the backdrop of the runway as the audience assembled. Simons said it was just a matter of spontaneous instinct that made him take flapper fringing as a central device in the show. ""But it was more about the aesthetics of that time. I didn't want to do a 'Charleston' collection,"" he said. ""Jil Sander must always be pure, and I'm aware of making any reference minimal, but I also want to show my freedom to be inspired by the moment.""</p><p>The opening of the show was a powerfully graphic series of one-color silhouettes in which silken skeins of fringing were draped over stretch bodysuits. It began a sequence of precision-cut experiments in form that abstracted tailoring into unexpected elements—shorts suits sliced into sharp, asymmetric angles at the front; hemlines constructed from rectangular panels; jackets made with a swooping drape in the back; leather shifts with incisions left open at the hip.</p><p>To be sure, Simons' exhaustive demonstrations of a million new ways to loop, drape, and fly a fringe (they even dangled to floor level on bags) did eventually tip over into tedium. He could have dispensed with a lot of that, but the development of his overriding vision of a clean, even glacial modernism is a powerful thing to watch.</p></div>"
115,spring,2009,s2009,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart played to her girlish base for Spring with a collection of floaty dresses that jetéd straight from the world of the ballerina. Though Stuart has been known to get a little saccharine at times, there were, thankfully, no tutus here. Instead, the designer seemed inspired by a sort of ad hoc rehearsing-the-dancer look, with leggings worn under layered, fluttery chiffon dresses, and strips of tulle knotted around wrists and ankles. Garçon jackets worn over dresses also worked to ground the collection's dreamy quality and inject a bit of edge. Stuart pushed her theme with harem pants, the best worn casually with a drapey cardigan and jersey top. The look reminded some of Marc Jacobs a few seasons ago, but if ever there were a time to propose a tricky pant, it's now. It may be a silly cliché to think that every woman wanted to be a ballerina as a little girl, but we're guessing that Stuart will sell to a few who really did.</p></div>"
116,spring,2009,s2009,john-galliano,"James Gillray and the Queen Mum. You had to be a bit of a British art-history nerd to get the references John Galliano was dispensing backstage to mostly blank looks from fashion correspondents. But thank goodness for Stephen Jones' erudition on historical headgear—and Google backup—because here we are at the source: outrageous Regency cartoons of silly fashions from the Napoleonic war era, giant plumed military helmets, overblown mob-caps, and indecently transparent dresses. Sorted. (Oh, apart from the Queen Mummery, which equals the sweet pea florals, of course.)</p><p>But did one actually need to know this to understand the collection? Hardly, because as accomplished as the backstage history boys may be, this was a show of tried-and-trusted Galliano classics put out at a moment when he's essentially brought his runway antics to a stop. What's walking out now are simplified, understandable pieces: parka-derived daywear with vestiges of military frogging in tape; little drapey jersey dresses; fragile rosette-sleeved cardigans; tiny, flippy ruffled floral skirts.</p><p>In one way, that challenges the idea that a fashion show has to be newsy to be worthwhile—though it's a harder case to make when a resentful, exhausted audience is expected to travel an hour on a cold Saturday night to an insalubrious quarter of Paris to view it. To justify this, Galliano needed to pull something special out of his hat. He did, eventually, in an evening section in which his fragile, sheer, spangled, romantically tinted and flower-printed dresses briefly settled onlookers into a serene state of appreciation. If there are parties to go to next season, these are the kinds of dresses many girls might dream of wearing to them. With an underslip, of course.</p></div>"
117,spring,2009,s2009,jonathan-saunders,"""Color,"" said Jonathan Saunders backstage before his show, when asked what he'd been thinking about for Spring. ""I wanted a bit of playfulness, something uplifting in these trying times."" He got things started with Sgt. Pepper jackets in the brightest turquoise and acid yellow, worn with sculpted-chiffon skirts that hit a few inches above the knee. Saunders chose lilac and baby pink for kimono jackets with stiff, somewhat awkward ruffles below the waist. And for the racerback tank bodices of youthful ballerina dresses, there were pastel jacquard weaves. Playful as the spirit was, you couldn't exactly call these office clothes.</p><p>Equally electric was a graphic, geometric print that appeared on a chiffon dress with a deep V-neckline and bell sleeves. If Saunders hadn't accepted the creative director post at the Milanese label Pollini, replacing Rifat Ozbek, he'd be a smart pick for the position that's said to be open at the Italian print house Emilio Pucci now that Matthew Williamson's contract is expiring. As for the uplifting part of Saunders' equation, that came in the form of two beautiful color-blocked floor-length dresses that closed the show. As new riffs on the sleek jersey columns that first got him noticed in London, they had a natural ease. Saunders is clearly pushing himself as a designer, but these looked as if they came to him easily, and for that reason alone they stood out.</p></div>"
118,spring,2009,s2009,josh-goot,"Emerald, violet, pink, aqua, pea green, yellow—the multihued slick of color that opened Josh Goot's show started life as watercolor paints sloshed onto a flat-bed scanner. ""Then we manipulated the images on the computer so they twisted and contorted like water,"" the designer explained. That high-tech, semi-scientific visual filtration of natural phenomena is a fascination Goot has (coincidentally) shared with Louise Goldin and Peter Pilotto this week. In Goot's case, the liquid prints undulated vividly down the length of sporty stretch-georgette tank dresses and set the color codes for all the single-hued pieces that followed.</p><p>The effect had a refreshing energy about it: pragmatic modernism dealt out in color-blocked jersey layerings of tees, sinuous skirts, and capes, or dresses with a graphic simplicity (the best of those came later: a half-black, half-nude toga elegantly cut from two squares). The show would have benefited from some condensing, but still, it left a bright and optimistic impression on the London audience. Goot is a young Australian who has chosen to show in Britain for the first time, but his sensibility, particularly this season, fits right into the local scene.</p></div>"
119,spring,2009,s2009,juan-carlos-obando,"They say that of all of the most famous Parisian couturiers, only Cristobal Balenciaga could actually make a garment from start to finish. Even today, it's the rare designer who can stand backstage, as Juan Carlos Obando did before his second New York outing, and state—with justifiable pride—""Every pattern, every stitch is my own.""</p><p>Obando can tell you the number of centimeters between the folds on one of his impeccably crafted gowns. He works with communities in Colombia to preserve quickly disappearing sewing techniques. His beautiful clothes are truly made with love—and sometimes with a magnifying glass. All of these are reasons why a presentation format might have better showcased Obando's artistry than a runway show, however dramatic and carefully orchestrated.</p><p>Obando's focus was on pleating ""in the craziest way possible, so it's like I'm painting with chiffon."" He spent time at a small pleating company in Los Angeles honing his expertise, and applied this amazing technique to midriff-bearing bustier tops that were paired with the first pants Obando has ever attempted. These were made of Japanese linen and tied in front for a nonchalant look that evoked lazy tropical-island days. But a pant does not daywear make, and this first stab at the category was not as convincing as he'd hoped. For now, Obando's skill is best admired on his gorgeous gowns, and there were plenty of those to marvel at.</p></div>"
120,spring,2009,s2009,junya-watanabe,"Excursions to the African continent have been a persistent theme in the Spring shows: surely something to do with the urge to get as far away from the West's problems as possible. Junya Watanabe has gone there, too, but on his runway there was no sense of panicked escapism. As the sound of spring birdsong twittered on the soundtrack, out came girls carrying sheaves of flowers in towering head wraps, and an instant atmosphere of sunny serenity filled the room.</p><p>The beauty of it was the way Watanabe struck such a beautiful balance between tribal references and his own signatures. He used colorful ""African"" prints with motifs of apples, hearts, and leaves, and bunched, twisted, and draped them into tops, tunics, and dresses, steadily mixing them with faded denim, bright gingham checks, pristine eyelets, and surprise splashes of leopard spots and neon. In fact, as Watanabe aficionados know, his interest in African drapery actually began in his hit collection of last Spring, and the patchworked denim pieces, fishtail skirts, and Edwardian jackets were in shapes that he's made his own throughout his career. With the crisscross flat leather sandals—a blessed sighting of some of the most comfortable footwear yet seen this season—it was a vision that offered something complete, natural, and unforced. Familiar, yes, but the kind of familiarity that breeds contentment.</p></div>"
121,spring,2009,s2009,just-cavalli,"At another label, the sand on the runway might've meant we were in for a rugged safari, perhaps featuring clothes with a utilitarian or, at the very least, sporty bent. Not at Just Cavalli. Even in the desert, the designer's party girls wear platform sandals, sequins, and big-time costume baubles. The only real nod to the show's ""Back to Nature"" title were leopard and zebra prints, but even they were done up in candy-colored silks that were patched together to create vaguely twenties-ish drop-waist dresses, a silhouette that reappeared in peekaboo black lace. The eighties had their moment, too, in the form of flippy denim or leather minis worn with slouchy rolled-sleeve tees featuring—believe it or not—macro-prints of the faces of Roberto and his wife, Eva. The little bit of this, little bit of that approach gave the show an I-just-nicked-this-from-my-mom's-closet vibe, totally in keeping with the way girls too young to remember the eighties dress today. The designers may have indulged their wacky side, but chances are that's just the way their customers like it.</p></div>"
122,spring,2009,s2009,kai-kuhne,"Second chances are hard to come by, but Kai Kühne is getting one thanks to Markus Hoefels, the same German venture capitalist whose investment helped Proenza Schouler get on its feet. Combine that good news with a feature in <em>The New York Times</em> this past weekend, and what do you get? A packed house.</p><p>Happily, the show's standout pieces—the highly constructed and sophisticated dresses—were up to the attention. Kühne's strength is tailoring, and his intricate seams and darts this Spring were inspired by, of all things, the humble leek. ""I'm interested in the humanification of nature,"" the designer said. Some of the fabrics—like one featuring pleated chiffon ""pebbles"" used on a belt-tied coat—suggested the vegetal world, too. But nature, at least the tree-hugging kind, is not what rushes to mind when one thinks of Kühne's work, which more than one observer has described as ""Germanic"" (a reference to its spirit, not the designer's passport).</p><p>While there were a few awkward experiments, like the ""antigravity"" dresses of suspended tiers, the real distraction was the show's overly complex choreography. At any one moment three clonelike models were walking the runway, slowing the tempo. Also, casting the mannequins as automatons somewhat dehumanized the clothes, which—despite their precise geometry—were molded to the body in celebration of the natural female form.</p></div>"
123,spring,2009,s2009,karen-walker,"It's always fun to hear Karen Walker's free associations on the season. Spring's blithely hopscotched from the Yearning for Zion Ranch (the Texas polygamist compound that was in the news this spring) to voodoo to baptismal dresses to the trippy seventies cult film <em>Holy Mountain</em>—all of this tied together by a rhapsody of blue.</p><p>From the old-time prairie look of Warren Jeffs' disciples she borrowed a certain high-collared austerity: buttoned-up shirting in classic oxford cloth, sheer pastel poplins, a quirky chicken print, and a lovely China-print silk voile. There were cuffed and cropped trousers and even a terrific pair of groovy wide-leg jeans. She worked the talismanic motifs of ram's heads and spiders into wearable printed-silk dresses and several highly covetable superfine T-shirts. Despite the general boyishness—one highlight being an adorable, boxy royal-blue shorts suit—she also provided a touch of glam, via chic L.N.D.s (little navy dresses; act like you know) and a peachy leopard print that was a perfect wild take on her cult-y cocktail frocks.</p></div>"
124,spring,2009,s2009,karl-lagerfeld,"Karl Lagerfeld once oh-so-memorably said that his signature line reflected how he would dress if he were a woman. Which (aside from the obviously borrowed-from-his-own-wardrobe touches like the crisp, white high-collared shirt or the clerical color scheme) surely makes for the intriguing psychology that underpins this label.</p><p>For Spring, the designer talked about ""blurring""—that is, rendering things not quite as they seemed. There were large, asymmetrical, girdling peplumlike patent-leather belts that shifted the silhouette, and veils of black chiffon trailing over indistinct floral prints. Erik Halley contributed metal body jewelry: Originally intended to mimic tattoos, it ended up looking more like a baroque lace, in contrast with the modernism of the clothes.</p><p>Modernism? Make that futurism, which was signaled by the first model, who beamed down in a <em>Close Encounters</em> shaft of light. Lagerfeld's sci-fi was actually more the retro-<em>Blade Runner</em> variety, as in an asymmetrically draped suit with forties tailoring or a pencil skirt that emerged from a peplum's pleated tiers.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""bdtud4""></div></div><p>This last item, shown in a sheer ice pink, clued us in to a more shadowy personality trait of this collection: a fetishistic <em>maîtresse</em> edge. If Chanel is Paris and Fendi is Milan, the Karl Lagerfeld line may be the place where he is most in touch with his inner Teuton—with all the severity that implies.</p></div>"
125,spring,2009,s2009,koi-suwannagate,"""People see me as 'knit girl,' "" said Koi Suwannagate backstage before her show. ""I want to show them what else I can do."" Luckily, that didn't mean a departure from her signature cashmeres—tees and rosette-studded vests still came in Suwannagate's favorite wool, but here she lined them with silk or jersey to keep them wearable. Delicately embellished dresses, meanwhile, assumed sheer and floaty, pleasantly summery forms.</p><p>Inspired by a vintage butterfly print, Suwannagate made that fanciful bug the mascot of her Spring outing, and it flitted around on hand-sewn Swarovski jewels and appeared in the fuchsia organza wings that flew down the back of an ivory cashmere cardigan. A collaboration with L.A.-based husband-and-wife artists Josh and He Yang led to a sherbet-hued fabric made from yarn with the texture of a cocoon; it was sweet enough on its own, but when combined with, say, a gauze top with butterfly embroidery, the effect was too overdone for Suwannagate's light and loose sensibility. On the other hand, the pair of floor-sweeping silk gowns that closed the show captured the fairy-tale spirit of her best pieces.</p></div>"
126,spring,2009,s2009,kris-van-assche,"No one could ever deny that Kris Van Assche sticks to his guns with his love of all things Latin American, but his fascination tends to be more intriguing than the fashion that results from it. This season, for instance, he was drawn to the <em>chola</em>, the Mexican gangbanger's moll. At least that was one interpretation of the black and midnight blue palette, the tank tops and baggy shorts (more boxer's shorts than boxer shorts), and the hard-edged styling touches like dark makeup and teardrop tattoos. But that toughness just came across as flat-out odd. Elsewhere, Van Assche honed his signatures: the floor-sweeping lengths, here in wrapped skirts, and the interplay of masculine and feminine elements, like a pinstriped jacket matched to a tiny skirt. A plain black pantsuit turned to reveal a waistcoat back to the jacket. Van Assche called his collection ""Sang Bleu,"" presumably a reference to the blue blood of aristocracy, but ""blue blood"" also connotes anemia, and, indeed, there was something anemic about an entirely sheer slubbed-gauze gown. Ship it with a slip? Not likely.</p></div>"
127,spring,2009,s2009,l-wren-scott,"The gusts of wind coming off the Hudson and sweeping straight down 21st Street to the door of the Gagosian Gallery set a fitting scene for L'Wren Scott's Spring collection, named ""Zephyr,"" after the Greek god of wind. ""There was a windstorm when I was designing,"" Scott explained inside the gallery. She set herself a specific goal this time: injecting billowing movement into her strict, rake-slim signature silhouettes of skinny jeans; sharp Victorian-inflected jackets; and lean, curve-gripping dresses. That objective was reflected in this almost exclusively black and white collection's vaguely avian theme: tail-feather pleats on fitted jackets, featherlike tufts atop a pinstriped chiffon blouse, or fat white feathers jutting from the sleeves and neck of a corseted cream dress. Siren gowns had both wispy marabou trim and the gentle swish of a fishtail hem. A dramatic marabou cape looked as if it might just take flight.</p><p>The collection had Scott's typical rock 'n' roll elegance, complete with dolly-bird hair and tilted lace fedoras, the latter a collaboration with Stephen Jones. The stylist-turned-designer is now in her fifth season, and her message rings ever more confidently and clearly, as evidenced by numbers like a romantic black plissé dress with white lace shoulders and an almost whimsical ""globule"" lace shift.</p><p>To finish, there was a trio of white evening looks, though Scott—known for advocating 24/7 glamour—wouldn't categorize them as bridal. ""They're just dresses to wear out,"" she said. After a final model lineup, the designer raised a glass of Champagne to the assembled: Ellen Barkin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rachel Feinstein Currin and John Currin, and Scott's beau, Mick Jagger, as well as those members of the working press lucky enough to snag a ticket. Parker gave her a giggly, girly hug. Mick's verdict: ""I loved it."" Enough said.</p></div>"
128,spring,2009,s2009,la-perla,"In a season when nudity is one of the big trends on the runways, it's ironic that Alessandro Dell'Acqua would play the modesty card at La Perla. Replacing the typically racier fare at today's show were tent dresses, peasant blouses, and flaring pants in a seventies-ish vein. ""Easy, light, and fresh"" were the words bandied about backstage. Not that there weren't lingerie details, but instead of being the main event, black lace was used as a layering piece over an emerald green dress. Broderie anglaise at the bottom of a trapeze coat looked positively sweet; the same goes for a ribbon lace vest and skirt. Other embellishments, like the gold sequins of a loose tank or the jewel-encrusted bodices of one-shoulder evening numbers, had more of a disco vibe. The problem was, nothing really separated this seventies revival from the countless others that have come before. You'd like to see La Perla capitalize on the technical fabrics and innovations of its lingerie business and apply them to a little black dress, say, or a pair of fitted pants—that would be more up-to-date.</p></div>"
129,spring,2009,s2009,lacoste,"Yes, that was a soundtrack of crickets chirping to accompany your entry into the Lacoste show—it was meant to evoke creative director Christophe Lemaire's idyllic Provençal childhood summers (who knew Arles has something in common with Akron?). And that's where Lemaire began—in Arles, not Akron, that is, via breezy by-the-pool shirtdresses over crocheted bikinis and all manner of crisp, pale cottons worn with leather sandals, rope belts, and straw bags spilling over with wildflowers. The designer then amped up the sport factor and color quotient in a sherbet-hued group of striped polo dresses and a slew of one-piecers—jumpsuits, rompers, and even a set of hooded terrycloth bodysuits. But the news here was the debut of the label's younger and, accordingly, less expensive line, unofficially named Red!. As he does with most of his runway oeuvre, Lemaire made a clear and bold visual statement, splicing his mod inspiration with golf gear in a punchy palette of black, white, and green. Mondrian-esque shifts with golf shoes made the point, but most girls (who aren't Annika Sorenstam) will probably flock to the less thematic merch, like the checkered windbreakers, cropped pants, and newly tightened and brightened polos with a maximized crocodile—going back to the heart of what brings us here in the first place.</p></div>"
130,spring,2009,s2009,lanvin,"Can voluptuous fashion stay relevant in an age of austerity? Can gorgeous decoration coexist with the need for something plain and simple? Ask Alber Elbaz, a man whose recipe for reductionism and all-out gorgeousness squared the circle with a unique flourish. ""Whatever's happening now,"" he said, ""it's the end of fake. What's not real will go. What we have to do now is make life easier for women.""</p><p>To him, that meant going back to the studio with scissors and fabric and working out, first, a supreme economy of cut and design. Airy shapes in poufy gazar, duchesse satin, georgette, and cloque were crafted from single shots of color in one-shouldered tops, balloon-sleeved blouses, and shifts in which the only feature is an internal drape that adds a miraculously chic fillip to the hip line. To begin with, this calm focus on the intrinsic value of structure was shown with nude shoes, so the eye had nothing to distract it from noticing, say, the way external darts ran up the hip and into the waist of a cool pair of black pants. It was intellectual and reserved, a quintessence of Lanvin that only Elbaz can achieve.</p><p>But suddenly, just before it all turned into a sober-sided treatise in form, the other side of Elbaz's brain kicked in. A mad blue leopard-spot dress with insane crystal-studded sunglasses and the hottest beaded and bejeweled high-heeled sandals advanced along the runway, and an outbreak of crazy high spirits took over. Ending the show with a gorgeous lineup of dresses in purple and blue fringed Lurex, crystal and knit embroidery, and random sprinklings of paillette flowers, Elbaz closed the season on a celebratory high. A counterintuitive moment, maybe, but it reflected something this designer understands as well as he does the principles of rational dressing: Even when times are dark, there's still room for clothes to make women keel over with desire.</p></div>"
131,spring,2009,s2009,lela-rose,"Ask any social you see this week, and she'll concur: Survival of the fittest applies just as much to the Upper East Side of Manhattan as it does to the Serengeti Plain. Lela Rose, who makes dresses beloved by the gazelles of the former, is already well-known for embracing color and embellishment, so it wasn't such a leap for her to go tribal this season. As ever, Rose plucked wisely from her source, working elements like a tapestry embroidery or a bib of gold rings into her pretty dresses, which were cut in slubby linens or jewel-tone silks and pleated organza. Inspired by traditional head wraps, she twisted and pleated a pretty pale ikat-print chiffon cocktail dress. This was a strong outing, allowing Rose to both play to her base and explore new ground with slouchy pants and sportier elements—buckled epaulets and a great printed-chiffon racerback tank—that kept her collection from tipping over into preciousness. A glimpse of striped knit added a kick of streetwear to the ladylike fare, too. We'd say Rose is surviving the kill-or-be-killed fashion game just fine.</p></div>"
132,spring,2009,s2009,limi-feu,"Limi's showroom was apparently filled with color and her runway backdrop was her favorite shade of pink, but at the last minute, she'd decided to focus her show on black and white, the signature combination of Japan's fashion avant-garde. That's her heritage, after all, and it was no big surprise that she went on to deliver the oversize proportions, asymmetry, and masculine/feminine interplay that you expect in the work of her dad, Yohji. But if the editing of color suggested some shrinkage of the sense of wicked fun that separates Limi from her forebears, that wasn't how things turned out. For one thing, this was a show whose soundtrack married poignant piano and shrieking Stooges.</p><p>Maybe that was the music the models were listening to on their Princess Leia headphones. One outfit was composed of shades of lilac; another, with a swingy red peasant skirt, suggested what might have been. Otherwise, Limi pushed the monochrome oversize to extremes with a long white shirt and an equally long skinny tie, or a jacket that was elongated to the knees, or suspendered clown-sized pants. But she also showed a little black dress with a portrait neckline, and a black suit (three-quarter sleeve jacket, pencil skirt) that was a girlier version of the twisted-but-dressy stuff her father excels at. A tiered dress in what looked like concertina-pleated midnight blue organza was positively glamorous. Then Limi hung the same idea off skinhead-thin suspenders. Just the kind of thing that works with a modern girl's tattoos.</p></div>"
133,spring,2009,s2009,loewe,"Stuart Vevers' Spring Loewe collection really needs to be seen up close. What he's doing at the Spanish leather-goods house is imbued with the kind of luxury that only fully reveals itself when touched: the butter-soft, wafer-thin suede elephant gray trench (""suede that's like velvet,"" as Vevers puts it); the malleable matteness of an ostrich zip-front skirt, or the pristine white softness of the classic ""Amazone"" tote bag he's retrieved from the archive. And there's much more. A self-confessed detail fanatic, Vevers, who moved from London to company headquarters in Madrid earlier this year, says he's been so obsessed with orchestrating bags, clothes, shoes, and jewelry that he's only had one day off a month.</p><p>Vevers came up with a general styling theme for Spring, loosely pegged on ""Chris von Wangenheim photos, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, and a touch of Memphis design,"" but, he points out, ""the real inspiration is Loewe itself."" In the clothes, Vevers played with military-cum-naval themes and then used the symbols: brass buttons as handbag chains and bracelets, ropes as gold belts and cuffs, Plexiglas anchors for pendants. Worked in there, too, was a perfectly on-trend outbreak of dots and spots: first on a perforated, tobacco-colored cotton dress, and then more prolifically on polka-dot bag appliqués or paint splashes on suede. ""What I like,"" said Vevers, ""is how 'classic' and 'sexy' are good bedfellows. I thought there was no point in joining a 'proper' house without doing it properly and respecting the integrity of what it is.""</p></div>"
134,spring,2009,s2009,louis-vuitton,"Sexy, saucy, and full-on Parisian, somewhere out of the forties and swizzled up with a dash of glitter and Josephine Baker African razzmatazz—Louis Vuitton came like a cathartic, mood-enhancing cocktail at the end of a long, grinding season. Or as Marc Jacobs, working slicked-back hair and a sharp-shouldered pinstripe suit, had it backstage, ""Little Parisienne princess, no?""</p><p>Well, yes and no. As a piece of fashion defiance in the face of incoming depression, this densely worked, heavily accessorized collection held inspiration for far more women than just leggy teenagers. Where recent Louis Vuitton collections have fallen into either confusing high jinks or an exclusionary high style (like last season's eighties reprise), this one—with its multitude of tiny, flippy skirts; obi-cinched waists; glittery sweaters; padded-shoulder jackets; and elegant wide-leg pants—had something to seduce everyone.</p><p>What held it together was the pitch-perfect spirit of the will to dress up in tough times. It was a suggestion rather than a theme, but there was something here of the plucky glamour of women in wartime Paris: a Deco-era palette sparkled up with showgirl glints of metallic python and crystal; crepe kilts spliced with windows of dotted net in the rear for naughty <em>jeune filles</em>; sculpted-shoulder blazers and graceful high-waist pants for grown-up mesdames.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""j3qjj""></div></div><p>And then there was the mesmerizing sight of a zillion accessories. A slew of tribal-art references came in necklaces, earrings, and stacks of bangles and amazing shoes loaded with sproutings of feathers and plastic collages of abstract African faces. The bags were back in sumptuous array: tactile, poufy shapes glowing with mixed-material suedes and multicolored metallics, python, and leopard spots. Quite brilliant.</p></div>"
135,spring,2009,s2009,louise-goldin,"Louise Goldin is a unique creature: a knitwear designer whose talent really soars in summer. Her imagination literally took off this season as she approached her subject from the point of view of ""remote sensors,"" i.e., what satellites see when they look down on Earth. ""And then,"" she said, ""I spent hours in scientific libraries researching data and being inspired by graphs, statistics, and high-tech fabrics developed for medicine.""</p><p>Even without knowing that backstory, there's no missing the futuristic energy of Goldin's complex, body-conscious bodysuits and dresses. Not that there aren't pitfalls in the endeavor. Shoulders built up in forms that suggested braces or exoskeletons could have swerved dangerously close to Starship Enterprise territory had Goldin not been so in control of her technique and palette. What saved her from that fate were interplays of sheer and solid fabric, an expert meting out of color (in combinations of white and nude, slowly building through ice blues to mauves), and the sense that, for all her imagination, Goldin has a genuine instinct for what a young woman might conceivably choose to put on her body. One idea was the sheer white hosiery-fine bodysuits and cycling shorts, used as a clever base for layering. Asked whether she'd sewn them from some kind of space-age fabric, Goldin laughed. ""Of course not. Who do you think I am? It's all knitted.""</p></div>"
136,spring,2009,s2009,luca-luca,"For his first complete collection at the helm of Luca Luca, Raul Melgoza looked more to the future—sometimes in an eighties <em>Blade Runner</em> kind of way—than the past, which meant fewer easily wearable pieces than the Luca customer (Ivana Trump, Tinsley Mortimer, et al.) might be used to. Melgoza clearly wants to push the label in a more sportswear-driven direction. That, coupled with the designer's architectural bent, resulted in a sculpted silhouette in a clean, practically all-white palette. In fact, there was nary a print nor embellishment in sight. Vents, panels, and slits—notably, in a lovely liquid-silver gown at the show's end—added interest to basic shapes. A few pretty lunch-to-cocktail dresses had the illusion of being more than one piece, and appeared in places to float off the body. Occasionally, though, Melgoza pushed things too far: Strange, space-age pod shoes gave the girls some trouble—Hye Park went ahead and took hers off—and a few looks fell on the wrong end of the sci-fi spectrum.</p></div>"
137,spring,2009,s2009,luella,"On a day when fashion—make that everyone—could do with some cheering up, Luella Bartley did quite a brilliant job of perking up London's spirits. How that's possible in combinations of mauve, orange, and pink, executed in tweed, lace, and frills, doesn't quite translate to the written word. Yet once the girl got going with the boxy jackets, and the asymmetrical tiered frill skirts, and the big satin hair bows, and the net veils, and the pearl-chain handbags, and the tulle gloves, she had the audience smiling like the financial markets could take care of themselves for a moment.</p><p>""I wanted it to be a proper, ladylike character—but a bit psychedelic,"" Bartley said. ""And I wanted color, but in a sort of sick way. When I saw it all lined up, I thought, Ew! Can we do this?"" Good job she did, because her Spring collection was simply the most worked and accomplished she's ever done. True, Comme des Garçons, Marc Jacobs, and Vivienne Westwood may have passed by way of Chanel-ish tweeds, hyper-color, tacky-but-cool frilly trimmings, and mini-crinis, but Luella's unique angle on haberdashery is that it must end up flattering the girl. The little suiting pieces patchworked together from lavender tweeds and overlays of lace with their upstanding frills encircling the shoulder somehow made tweed look nonfrumpy—and possible to wear without the slightest air of irony. And when she does a dress, she knows what girls love: a bit of a prom number, but in this case with a nipped waist, a swathed top, a yoke to flatten the hips, and all kinds of bouncy tiers and rear peplum action switching along as she walks.</p><p>The fact that Bartley also incorporated the striped collegiate blazers that used to pop up at the beginning of her career and new versions of last summer's Liberty florals among the fan-pleated dresses was a smart commercial move—they liked it last time, here's the update. Everything else she had going on was a delicious step into girl-tempting newness: the pillboxes and hair accessories and the piled-on, mixed-up pearls and diamanté in the jewelry, as well as her clever transpositions of necklaces into shoulder-bag chains. Bartley herself—possibly because she's an ex-journalist and doesn't pretend to be anything other than an accessible mid-price designer—is quite offhand about the level of accomplishment it took to achieve all this. Still, it seems like a fitting time to remember that Bartley is part of the close-knit cohort of London designers, including Stella McCartney and Phoebe Philo, who have been coming into their own these past few years. She's often overlooked, but Bartley now deserves every bit as much credit as her friends in high places.</p></div>"
138,spring,2009,s2009,luisa-beccaria,"Before the first model hit the runway, Luisa Beccaria sent out her young daughter and son, along with two other beautiful little kids, to scatter rose petals. Whether or not you appreciated the flower children is a good indicator of how you might feel about the collection itself: For some, Beccaria's party dresses are the very essence of romance; for others, they're just too sweet. But there's no arguing that this was one of her most accomplished shows. It was cohesive, well-made (although she'll have to address the sheerness issue before retail), and utterly charming.</p><p>Flowers, it should be obvious, were the collection's main motif. They were printed in delicate, powdery bouquets on swirling natural cotton-muslin dresses and embroidered in pink on a white georgette gown. Ruffles were another theme. They trailed round and round the skirts of strapless tulle frocks in two-tone shades of pink or lilac. Silk mikado skirtsuits, again with ruffles tracing the lapels, provided a counterpoint to all that softness. The lineup was composed almost entirely of dresses, which made a chic pair of belted, high-waisted cropped pants, worn with an embroidered ivory blouse, all the more noticeable. It was a cool look—and even those who shun rose-colored glasses would be tempted.</p></div>"
139,spring,2009,s2009,lutz-patmos,"Tina Lutz and Marcia Patmos set their collection at the seaside at the start of summer. As they designed, they were imagining the opening of a beach house after a long, gray winter—letting in the light, taking that first walk on the dunes. This poetic vision was applied to the clothes with appropriate abstraction: Dresses were adorned with wavelike ruffles, a tactile gold-leafed cardigan featured a shell stitch, and a chartreuse sweater had snail-like braid embellishments.</p><p>""Seasonless"" is a term that could be applied to both the clothes and to the house's celebrity guest designer of the moment: Jane Birkin, the actress and activist—and Lutz's idol since the age of 10—who contributed an off-the-shoulder V-neck and tank. (Past collaborators include Kirsten Dunst, Carine Roitfeld, and Richard Meier.) Airy knit laces, like most of the sweaters, were light enough to wear on a June evening with a chill in the air.</p><p>Lutz &amp; Patmos, of course, made its name with cashmere—a winter thing, it used to go without saying. But, eco-conscious and aware of the quickly changing climate, they are of the opinion that all designers, of knitwear or otherwise, will have to start thinking beyond seasons.</p></div>"
140,spring,2009,s2009,maison-martin-margiela,"The house was packed for Martin Margiela's 20th-anniversary collection, an occasion whose significance was sharpened by the swirling rumors—causing fear among the many Margiela wearers in the hall—that he is about to retire. (To get that one out of the way up front, a spokeswoman categorically denied that fashion's mystery man is going anywhere just at the moment.) What unfolded, in inimitable house style, was less a sentimental catalog of past hits than a reminder of the continuing relevance of Margiela's sidelong contributions to stimulating fashion over two decades and 40 collections.</p><p>First, there is the remarkable case of the narrow, slightly puffed Edwardian-shouldered jacket that dates from his first Spring collection, designed in 1988, which is still completely wearable now (it's being rereleased). And at the other end of the time line, there are the pointed shoulder pads of the 2006 bodysuits and jackets, with which Margiela triggered the beginning of a widespread silhouette change that is working its way through fashion now. The twist was that although the show was a revisiting of past collections, there were also slyly brilliant updates that put it right in the forefront of this summer's thinking. Circular-cut leather? Margiela first thought of that in 2005, and now the same geometries are blowing up all over the runways. Wigs, too—a favorite of the house since Fall 1995—have now spilled all over jackets in cuts that look like a Margiela comment on the current fad for fringing.</p><p>Almost each and every look had that then/now familiarity and surprise about it, and all of it was carried off without compromise on ""incognito"" models with their faces blanked out by stocking scarves and cascades of hair. At the end, though, the conceptual rigor gave way to pure silly high spirits as a perambulating birthday cake walked by, followed by a marching band and a horde of Margiela's lab-coated assistants. As usual, he wasn't among them, but he was apparently there watching behind the scenes. It's to be hoped Margiela was savoring the roar of approval that went up from the crowd.</p></div>"
141,spring,2009,s2009,malo,"There was a hustle-bustle of excitement—and as much Italian spoken as English—at the Celeste Bartos Forum this morning as Alessandro Dell'Acqua's debut for Malo drew near. The anticipation was understandable given the number of personnel changes that have occurred at the fabled Italian cashmere house since it started showing in New York in 2006. Dell'Acqua is in fact the third designer to take the creative reins in that short time (or fourth, if you count the team of Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, who left for Gianfranco Ferré in April, as two instead of one). What, the audience wondered, would he bring to the party?</p><p>Dell'Acqua's stated theme, ironically, was suspension, and by the third look it was clear what he meant by that: Iris Strubegger appeared in a sort of tiered ""lobster dress,"" bands of fabric hung on gossamer tulle (a very modern homage, perhaps, to Dell'Acqua's favorite designer, Charles James). Boxy, tailored, sleeveless jackets had a tough, deconstructed vibe thanks to the use of suspension bars—a familiar concept to Ralph Rucci fans. Adding some celebratory sparkle to the proceedings were jeweled tulle inserts here and there. Dell'Acqua's well-edited dress parade also included two goddess gowns in a cashmere so light-gauge it would have made even Botticelli envious.</p><p>But although Dell'Acqua's collection served up sophisticated, trend-aware clothes on the half shell, as it were, the suspense on the retail end remains: Sure there are pearls (and purls) to be found here, but will the fashion-forward customer think to look for them at Malo?</p></div>"
142,spring,2009,s2009,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Plenty of people in the Marc by Marc Jacobs crowd were still coming off the fashion high produced by his spectacular signature collection of the previous evening. More so than usual, his little-sister line provided a compelling sort of coda. The mix-and-match, more-is-more sensibilities of one collection echoed the other's. There was even a bit of overlap in the silhouettes: Here, utility belts worn in multiples and sometimes slung with nylon fanny packs replaced Monday night's glittering sashes. But if the former verged on couture, this was kids' play. Silhouettes like baby dolls and trapeze dresses will get the youth vote, likewise the patchwork denim and the splashy prints. Tweedy jackets with rolled-up sleeves and pants with paper-bag waists, though, have real crossover potential. And with the money those brocades will cost you, at least one thing's for certain: The price is right.</p></div>"

There are as many meanings to derive from a Marc Jacobs collection as there are crashers at his shows. But listen to the litany that Jacobs himself provided after all 53 of his Spring looks—each one more colorful, more multilayered, and more zanily accessorized than the last—had circled his Stefan Beckman-designed Hall of Mirrors runway: ""America, womanly, Broadway, Perry Ellis, country, naïveté…""</p><p>It was a mash-up to end all mash-ups, and as an American in Paris—that was Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" cleverly playing on the soundtrack—Jacobs is better situated than most to deliver it. He's developed an expat's eye, and could it be that he actually misses the States? In any case, he sees a certain beauty here. Take the fourth look: There was the prairie skirt provocatively bustled turn-of-the-century style, a gingham shirt, a Lurex-shot plaid sash that winked at both the frontier West and his own grunge collection for Perry Ellis, a metallic tweed motorcycle jacket, and, for accessories—ka-ching—a crushed-straw hat, a chunky necklace, and a quilted chain-link bag. Athletic references appeared elsewhere in the form of wide stripes on a pair of sundresses and Lurex-ribbed knit sweaters with baseball jersey-style contrasting sleeves. And mixed in among all the electric colors and the shiny bits were peaked-shouldered black jackets and vests worn with wide-leg trousers cropped below the knee.</p><p>This season, nothing escaped Jacobs' roving eye or his melting-pot mentality. And in his hands even a thing like a farm-girl apron gets tweaked and reinterpreted until, impossibly, it becomes the very definition of contemporary chic. ""It's about the joy of dressing up,"" he finally said backstage. And how.</p></div>"
144,spring,2009,s2009,marchesa,"It was glamour with a capital <em>G</em> at Marchesa—and it had nothing to do with Harvey, the line of town cars as far as the eye could see, or the paparazzi buzzing around both the entrance and exit to the Chelsea Art Museum. No, this was all about the 24 exquisite dresses inside, presented in a modern manner with dewy-faced models perched atop glossy white cubes like living artwork, or perhaps young goddesses—particularly apt for a white Grecian gown traced with gold embroidery. Though it was a tight collection, it seemed to cover so many bases: short and spirited in a little ombré fringe number, darkly soigné in an asymmetrical black lace gown, and no-holds-barred belle of the ball in a frothy lilac tulle gown with a spray of orchids crafted, unbelievably, from feathers. There was a subtle thread of the Far East running through, seen most overtly in mandarin collars, an obi belt, and origamilike pleating. But as designer Georgina Chapman explained, she tends to go with her instincts instead of belaboring references. Well, they were dead-on here: It was a best-dressed list from start to finish. A young retail consultant walked out sighing, ""Don't these dresses just make you want to be a fairy princess?"" Or one better: How about an Oscar-nominated actress? They have a better chance of wearing these dresses—if they call their stylists soon, that is.</p></div>"
145,spring,2009,s2009,marios-schwab,"In the past three or four seasons, Marios Schwab has brought a precocious level of rigorous, scientific thinking and research to his runway. This season, however, he moved away from one-note drama, like last Spring's anatomical dissection, to a collection that touched on many themes—the draped Greek chiton, the rope-bound ""wrapping"" work of Christo, a bit of the beige-suede eighties, and some sportswear.</p><p>In other words, it was confusing. What were drapey jersey gowns and all-in-ones doing in the same breath as structured, cutout suede dresses or, indeed, printed T-shirts? Backstage Schwab's explanation didn't fully articulate what was going on. He might've thought that it's a good time to sell accessibly—along with those printed T-shirts, there were swimsuits and drapey beach cover-ups that could find their way into any boutique. That sort of brand extension is a first for Schwab, but with a top line of items that are going to be a tough sell (a jersey jumpsuit slashed open from the ankle all the way up the inside of the leg, for one), it's hard to know whether it's going to have anything more than a lukewarm appeal.</p></div>"
146,spring,2009,s2009,marni,"It's one of the highest accolades for any label when it can be said, by all and sundry, insiders and outsiders, that it ""owns"" a look. Marni has reached that serene plateau of development and is reveling in undisputed ownership of print, color, and the magpie mix-up. That means never having to grasp nervously for an extraneous trend. Downbeat dressing? Restraint and somber color? Not heard of here.</p><p>Among her multi-textured, many-layered spots, stripes, blurry checks, painterly abstracts, harlequin lozenges, and splashy fifties flowers, Consuelo Castiglioni wove in an untrammeled sense of optimism and continuity. Her striped and frill-fronted cardigans; sparkly loop-fringe mini boleros; and dense, shimmery embroideries of multicolored spiky plastic paillettes were just some of the star moments. The bigger success, though, is how Castiglioni flings it all together, ties it up in the middle, adds a kneesock and a clunky platform, and yet still somehow manages to stop short of busy confusion. That simple/complicated knack is what keeps Marni lovers coming back for more, as well as the knowledge that the collection is a cherry picker's bonanza full of pieces that lend themselves to myriad personal styles.</p></div>"
147,spring,2009,s2009,martin-grant,"There might be fewer reasons to kick up one's heels if the markets keep heading south, but for party dresses Martin Grant is still a go-to guy. Maybe more so than ever, considering he specializes in the sort of unflashy, elegantly anonymous dresses that a woman can return to year after year. All she has to do is update her accessories—this season the designer layered the necklaces on thick, courtesy of a shop next door to his atelier that sells chains by the meter.</p><p>Pleating was a key motif of the short, concise show. It was eye-catching on the neckline of a Champagne-gold halter dress and on the hip of a long navy column. He focused most of his attention on after-dark options, but a few day looks did make the cut, including a sleek trench and two other coats with more pleating on the sleeves. One pair of trousers came with origamilike folds at the pockets. Too bad he didn't see fit to include some of his sharp suits in the mix.</p></div>"
148,spring,2009,s2009,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson is on his own trip. Season in and season out, he practices a particular brand of Ibiza chic: neons, bohemian beading, and caftans are always in his bag of tricks. With bright colors and bold prints on the checklist for retailers (these items' cheery optimism makes them reliable sellers in a depressed economy), Williamson is in step for Spring. Sequined racerback tank maxi dresses in a graphic print jersey will make the cut with stores and longtime fans like Julia Stiles and Joy Bryant, the latter of whom sported one of the designer's sundresses with sandals, despite an impending downpour—how's that for optimism? Also in the plus category: a belted, allover sequin tunic dress; a beaded bed jacket worn with an easy T-shirt and cropped white jeans; and an absolutely electric abstract floral-print chiffon that was used for a very of-the-moment jumpsuit, as well as parachute pants and one of Williamson's signature caftans. He veered too far off course, however, with a black leather bustier and motocross pants. Why mess with a good thing?</p></div>"
149,spring,2009,s2009,maurizio-pecoraro,"The opening lines of the Grace Jones tune ""Slave to the Rhythm"" could be heard at the beginning and end of Maurizio Pecoraro's show. ""This is what Edith Piaf used to say: 'Use your faults, use your defects, then you're gonna be a star.' "" Pecoraro may dance to his own beat, but he was certainly on trend sampling Jones (see D&amp;G), and what's more, Milan came around this season to the sorts of embellishments the ever-romantic designer always favors: fringe, ruffles, and sequins by the truckload (here on vintage-looking sweaters, party dresses, and even underwear). So this should be his moment, right? Well, sort of. On the plus side, he also showed Spring's nudes and makeup colors in trompe l'oeil drapery prints. On the negative, the stylist's hand was too heavy with the jewelry—as if to make up for the lack of a clear message from the clothes. This time, at least, Pecoraro's here, there, and everywhere collection didn't have that star quality.</p></div>"
150,spring,2009,s2009,max-azria,"Simply put: Max went minimal for Spring. With ideas of purity and paring down, designing couple Max and Lubov Azria sent out a parade of jersey girls in an almost exclusively pale and neutral color palette. For the label, it was a welcome breath of fresh air, particularly when you consider its somewhat complicated and corseted Fall. The look this time around was mostly very fluid, with lots of draping, twisting, and casually exposed shoulders and backs. There was also a clean athleticism to it, with tops and dresses layered over bandeaux, bodysuits, and stretchy ribbed belts. Evening—an important category for a label that often dresses its front-row denizens (today that meant Barbara Bush, Tinsley Mortimer, and Maggie Betts)—was similarly clean in unembellished georgette, cut to dramatically flap and flutter. It took a minute to realize that one of the songs on the show's playlist was the Black Ghosts' ""The Repetition Kills You."" It wasn't quite murder, but it did get a little monotonous. At least the Azrias were in on the joke (we think).</p></div>"
151,spring,2009,s2009,max-mara,"In a season when no one can really be sure how she'll feel about spending money six months hence, it would make sense that a label with a tried-and-trusted signature like MaxMara would smell its advantage and turn out the most convincing argument on Earth for believable classics. Instead, what transpired on the runway only served to raise bewildering questions. Will real women want viscose overalls in silky fabrics next spring? Will they see themselves in shirtdress-cum-rompers? Does a go-to-work pantsuit benefit from the addition of souped-up carpenter trousers? And does any of that improve when you've seen it repeated in four different colorways and fabrics? Who, really, is going to go for dungarees in white sequins?</p><p>A tremendous amount of goodwill exists toward MaxMara, and that should never be dismissed. The problem here is the frustration of seeing a great company miss its opportunity. It would almost have been preferable had a whole series of commercial suits and coats been trotted out—presumably that's what the MaxMara customer will really be buying come spring. What seemed to be going on—and there was plenty of time to diagnose it as yet another repeat garment passed by—was a misreading of what might actually pique the interest of the press. Fancied-up sportswear in however many swatch options just didn't do it this time.</p></div>"
152,spring,2009,s2009,meadham-kirchhoff,"Ed Meadham and Benjamin Kirchhoff have been on a slow burn in London. Last season, their long, sinuous silhouettes in romantic navy-and-black lace and chiffon garnered them an underground following. The question was, how could that dark, goth sensibility shift gears for Spring?</p><p>The answer wasn't immediately clear when they opened with sheer black organza tailoring, but when they brought on their ideas about hybrid jean-leggings, the show hit its stride. The top half of an outfit might be a slick black tunic or a shirt encrusted with what Ed Meadham calls ""rotting lace""; it's what was going on below that drew every eye in the house. Their cool amalgams of denim, armor, and motocross leathers, patched together from shredded indigo denim, articulated kneepads, cross-lacing, and zippers turned out to be handmade. Quite how these could be industrially manufactured in this exact form is hard to see, but Meadham and Kirchhoff are onto something. Ever more extreme and decorative ways of dressing the leg are taking off this season, and if this pair figures out a simplified way to make theirs accessible, they could have a hit on their hands.</p></div>"
153,spring,2009,s2009,michael-kors-collection,"Leave it to Michael Kors to channel our election-year anxieties about the future of the country into a feel-good paean to our homegrown style. From the first trill of the Beach Boys' ""Good Vibrations"" to the last stretch jersey gown, Kors' collection was an extended riff on American classics, from teeny-weeny polka-dot bikinis (worn with fifties-style full skirts) and picnic-blanket-check pinafore dresses to sporty neoprene scuba shifts. Yes, even that much-maligned uniform of Middle America, the tracksuit, got a tweaking. Forget polyester: Kors' version comes in crushed silk.</p><p>In keeping with the flag-waving theme, there were more stripes than you'd find on all the lapel pins in Congress: pinstripes on an origami wrap dress, navy and red horizontal bands on a formfitting stretch knit sheath, and countless nautical tees and sweaters worn with crumpled cotton trousers, bathing-suit bottoms, and ball skirts. No, there was nothing subtle about it. And it wasn't the home run that last season's <em>Mad Men</em> romp was; for one thing, it didn't look as rich, and Kors' ladies like rich if nothing else. But you can't fault Kors' enthusiasm, or his joie de vivre (pardon our French). Only the most hardened cynics in the crowd left feeling less than optimistic.</p></div>"
154,spring,2009,s2009,milly,"Michelle Smith took a vacation in Tuscany this summer, but her clothes for Spring were bound for Marrakech circa 1970. Smith's a few seasons late on the boho revival, but that didn't stop her from piling on the crochet bikinis, sheer caftans, and bead-heavy embroidery. The trippy prints were fun—a lavender ikat would look nice with a tan—but overall, there wasn't much that felt fresh.</p></div>"
155,spring,2009,s2009,miss-sixty,"A hodgepodge of references popped up in Miss Sixty's exuberant collection—a seventies flower child in a shoulder-exposing silk-voile top, for instance, trading places with a sexy schoolgirl in a crocheted beret and striped kneesocks. But who needs a believable narrative when the story is fun and the front-row characters include Blake Lively, Rosario Dawson, and Becki Newton?</p><p>Realism is not what the customer craves—see the success of <em>Gossip Girl</em> for proof—and it has never been first and foremost on the minds of those who create this denim label. The best thing to do with these graphic tees, halter jumpsuits, and tiny rompers is to embrace the kitsch.</p></div>"
156,spring,2009,s2009,missoni,"For the best of Missoni, scroll to the end. There, for evening, were examples of the exceptional things this house can tease out of a knitting machine: a tissue-fine, fan-pleated Lurex halter gown in an almost colorless beige; a glinting semi-sheer skirt under a belted knit blazer. Those were the high points of a show in which Angela Missoni continued to steer the family business along the grown-up course she's been charting for the past couple of seasons.</p><p>The general drift of the main body of the collection was a merging of vaguely Japanese-influenced shapes (kimono sleeves, obi belts) with surface patterns derived from Italian futurist art, worked in a palette of beige, muted coral, cocoa, and absinthe. Beneath that, Missoni seemed to be setting herself the task of figuring out how jumpsuits and big, drop-crotch pants can make sense for regular public consumption. Her answer was all-in-ones ending in short, divided skorts on the one hand, and a pair of voluminous dark green taffeta evening skirt-cum-pants on the other. On the cute—and very recognizably Missoni—side, there was a zigzag raschel knit swimsuit, along with plenty of easy caftan-style cover-ups. These, like the evening dresses, clicked more easily into the picture of long summer leisure days that gives this house its identity.</p></div>"
157,spring,2009,s2009,miu-miu,"""It's an investigation of our history, of our European past."" With that big idea in mind, Miuccia Prada sent out a focused collection of nipped-waist dresses, as well as tops and skirts in pleated burlap or silk, most of them layered with a low, hip-slung apron. Sometimes the fabrics were dotted with fraying holes, as if moths had descended and started munching en masse. Other times it looked as if spray-paint artists had gotten their hands on them, dipping the ridges of a pleated brown frock in a rusty red or scrawling graffiti squiggles across the front of a skirt.</p><p>The history part came in with prints that looked like painted Roman tiles; they magnified as the show progressed so that faces in profile eventually abstracted into random assemblages of square dots. They made for an interesting juxtaposition with the images on the walls of the Avenue Foch mansion, which provided a look at Miu Miu's own roots in the form of Warhol-esque screen prints of ad-campaign stars including Lindsay Lohan, Kim Basinger, and Kirsten Dunst (who was in the audience).</p><p>Prada's perforated tops and skirts last season have proved to be quite influential (witness all the laser-cut materials on Spring's runways). So—who knows?—maybe there's hope for bulky burlap and aprons. But in an uncertain future, the odds look better for the less-challenging and sexier silk numbers.</p></div>"
158,spring,2009,s2009,modernist,"Abdul Koroma and Andrew Jones are not typical photo-fit young British designers, whether in their working patterns or, come to that, their clothes patterns. In their day jobs, the two work for MaxMara, and their own collection strives for something more sophisticated than East End edgy. (They have a studio in London from which they design the Modernist line. What kick-started them to set up the label was entering the Fashion Fringe competition in 2005.)</p><p>This season, Koroma and Jones based their ideas on wedding trousseaux, using lace, tulle, and organdy in ornate dresses and sheer blouses. If some of it was overworked and problematic to wear (stiff panniers and peplums; lots of exposed bras), the simplest numbers came out well (a pristine white brocade pantsuit; a violet chiffon dress with a gathered neckline, bloused into the waist with a ribbon sash; a chic navy drop-waist dress with a wrap-over neckline and a flippy skirt). Clearly, these designers don't need any lessons about fabric and how to use it. What they still have to nail, though, is the art of making a concise statement without artsy trappings. Maybe if they weren't so anxious to prove themselves, it would flow more easily. They should relax, and make it simpler.</p></div>"
159,spring,2009,s2009,monique-lhuillier,"""It's about tropical-island getaway,"" said Monique Lhuillier before her show. But before one could envision a sand-crusted, wild-haired bohemian beach muse, the designer added: ""but for the chic Monique woman."" And properly chic they were, coming down a sisal runway. Lhuillier's eveningwear is usually faultless, if a little safe, and Spring continued in that vein. But here she lightened things up, trading heavy beading for airy tulle appliqué or a fresh and earthy wheat print that was lovely on flowing white chiffon. Queen of the night though she may be, Lhuillier is venturing further into day—the result of customer demand. There was a tailored dark denim pencil skirt topped by a billowy blouse, and a sleeveless wave-print trench with shorts that was surely the sportiest thing her runway's ever seen. We're not sure where a nipped-waist, sleeveless denim shift with armholes edged in chunks of gold beading fits into a schedule, but it was nicely done all the same.</p></div>"
160,spring,2009,s2009,moschino,"The giant gowns that formed the backdrop at the Moschino show were an early clue that Rosella Jardini and her team were thinking big—at least in the literal sense. The next clue came when the first girl walked out in a black-and-white dress in an oversize harlequin print topped off with an enormous bow at the neck and, above that, a towering bouffant updo. Bows also decorated large top-handle leather bags, but they weren't the only detail blown up to exaggerated proportions. Ruffles and roses were in full effect, the former spilling down a cocktail number or arranged in tiers on a drop-waist frock, and the latter punctuating the waistline of a mint-green satin plunge-front jumpsuit or the back of a black-and-white floor-length dress. Hearts, a house signature, were a recurring motif as well—as rhinestone clasps on clutch bags or as an almost unrecognizable white graphic on a black shift dress (it was flipped upside down). But overall, there wasn't as much heart as usual in this overlong and somewhat repetitive collection, which is usually such a reliable source for wit and whimsy.</p></div>"
161,spring,2009,s2009,moschino-cheap-chic,"If you were looking for a post-Black Monday pick-me-up, you could do worse than Rosella Jardini's Moschino Cheap &amp; Chic show. Though hardly groundbreaking, her Spring collection was like a shot of vitamin D, all sunshine and light—from the prints (photo-realistic roses and bunnies) to the colors (wisteria, mandarin orange, strawberry) to the silhouettes (jumpsuits, balloon dresses). A slouchy button-down and rolled-hem shorts set in a floral photo-print silk satin looked fresh, as did the long, butterfly-print silk jersey columns, especially the one in emerald and marigold. Amid a silver brocade party dress, a quilted chiffon coat, and a Pierrot-collar sleeveless shift, the clingy dhoti pants worn with tunic dresses caught the eye. Perhaps included as a last-minute stab at a bit of au courant flavor, they gave the show an edge that it otherwise lacked.</p></div>"
162,spring,2009,s2009,mulberry,"""What is Mulberry as a brand?"" mused Emma Hill, the new creative director at the burgeoning British leather-goods company. ""I think we're warm and fuzzy. Not standoffish. A bit of a national treasure."" Hill is a valuable property in the handbag world, having worked for Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Gap, and (last season) Halston, and now she's bringing all those American smarts back home to her native England. Her first move was to put on a series of showroom presentations to introduce the Summer collection for women and men, or, as she put it, ""a girlfriend and boyfriend."" On the girls' side, she kept everything short and cute, with full-skirted beige dresses paired with shrunken leather jackets, lemon or orange shifts with details like ""binocular pouch"" pockets, and stack-heeled loafers and gladiators. But this is essentially a handbag house, and Mulberry is now building handbag ""family"" groups, playing with scale and new finishes to leverage the success of the Bayswater and other house hits. New on the block are a chestnut Mitzy hobo, a giant jelly tote, and hottest of the lot, a generously sized day Bayswater clutch, which solves the problem of transporting the daily burden without ruining your shoulder line with a strap.</p></div>"
163,spring,2009,s2009,naeem-khan,"A quick scan of the invocations in Naeem Khan's show notes—the late sixties crossed with icons of eccentricity Diana Vreeland, Loulou de la Falaise, and Tina Chow, all transported to the Orient—was clue enough that what followed would be a riot of exotic excess. Khan didn't turn up the volume all at once; instead he started off uncharacteristically minimal with an asymmetrical white jersey gown with a sari-inspired drape. But soon enough we were neck deep in densely colorful cherry blossom and mythic phoenix embroideries, sizzling sequins, and candy-colored chinoiserie jacquards, some doubling up on the drama factor with voluminous portrait collars and fat origami pleating. Khan occasionally came up for air with flowing jewel-toned satin gowns, some with a focused chunk of blingy crystal beading—they were still look-at-me dresses, but sans the madness. Though it's often been said that executing simplicity is what's difficult, going over-the-top also requires a deft hand—which some of Khan's pieces lacked. Yes, too much good taste can be boring, as Vreeland famously said, but Khan's big-spending clientele presumably want people to stare for the right reasons.</p></div>"
164,spring,2009,s2009,nanette-lepore,"Nanette Lepore has never had a reputation for being politically charged, but she chose to take a stand at her Spring show. ""Save the Garment Center"" was splashed across the set backdrop, also appearing on buttons, pencils, and staff T-shirts (Garment Center tees are emerging as one of the week's more unusual trends—they were also prominent at Anna Sui). It gave some edge to an otherwise delicate collection in an ""exotic garden"" palette of poppy, turquoise, and jade. Ruffles showed up in virtually every look, from a supersoft cropped leather jacket with fluttery sleeves to silk skirts with seriously flouncy hems. Lepore took a bow with her young daughter, both in the same slogan shirts as the staff, except craftily reworked with ribbon, lace, and sequins. The DIY touch was a reminder of the Garment Center spirit activists are trying to save.</p></div>"
165,spring,2009,s2009,narciso-rodriguez,"""Rocking ninja-star action!"" No, it's not some new video game; it's how Narciso Rodriguez summed up his Spring collection. He's never been a floral-print man, but this season New York's most rigorous designer really amped up the edginess with, yes, ninja-star prints and ninja-star bugle-bead embroidery, one-sleeved bandage dresses, and studded bodices that evoked armor. Even the tailoring with which he started the show had something of the warrior to it: The collar- and lapel-less zip-closure jackets he's been experimenting with the last couple of seasons came with newly rounded yet strong shoulders reminiscent of the traditional <em>gis</em> of karate masters.</p><p>The elevated sense of sexiness didn't come at the expense of pretty, however. There were more colors—sage, kelly green, red, salmon pink, rust, and nude—than in his last several collections combined. The banding motif that he employed throughout (strips of fabric, usually in a contrasting color or fabric arranged geometrically on the front and back of tops and dresses) served to amplify his models' hourglass curves. And then there were the cutouts, more daring than ever before, a provocative flash of skin below the bust or crisscrossing bodice straps that exposed the ribs and swaths of the models' backs. You couldn't exactly call it freewheeling, but this was Rodriguez at his loosest and best.</p></div>"
166,spring,2009,s2009,nathan-jenden,"Nathan Jenden's invitation announcing ""I Want Candy"" in appropriately gaudy colors triggered a distant memory of Bow Wow Wow's cover version of the song of that name. That was back in the eighties, the decade out of which Jenden's intensely toned outfits popped like…well, like candies. One piece looked like it was made of psychedelic cocktail umbrellas (or a Dale Chihuly glass sculpture). A cowl-backed short dress with a shimmer of sequins was disco ready, like the black leather jacket with crystal-encrusted sleeves. A white ruffled blouse paired with a big tie brought Sheena Easton to mind.</p><p>Thierry Mugler made for a more upmarket association, in a suit with a pencil skirt and a peplum so stiff it would take your eye out. A bustled jacket with a tight calf-length skirt that flared into a kick-pleat and a second-skin strapless dress with ruffles cascading down the back were a little Thierry, a lot forties starlet…and eighties on top of it all. This sort of <em>de trop</em> sensibility makes the eighties the decade of the moment (again!), according to the latest issue of <em>Pop</em> magazine, so Jenden is on the money there. But unfortunately his collection served more as a reminder that the eighties were also known as the era that taste forgot.</p></div>"
167,spring,2009,s2009,nicole-miller,"Before the sighting of a single look, it was abundantly clear from the mosaic-patterned runway that Nicole Miller planned to unabashedly indulge her love of prints for Spring. When it comes to faraway inspiration, Miller is a frequent flier. This season's sartorial trip took her to Haiti, where the brightly plumed exotica of voodoo caught her eye. One quirky print even featured rows of voodoo dolls, and others echoed the tiny tiled look of the runway. To avoid getting carried away with a theme and a total prints-travaganza, Miller grounded the magical with the practical, as seen in terrific menswear-inflected pieces—at their best in boyish tailored blazers, made new with outside seams or by being cut in a decidedly unstuffy chalk-stripe linen. These paired well with the many newly ubiquitous cropped, slouchy trousers, as well as shirting that glimmered with a hint of gold thread. With so much color and tomboyish kick, this was an optimistic collection. You could barely fault the designer for the conceptual exuberance in awkward dresses that looked like suiting wools twirled around a man's shirt, or the overly dramatic sculptural winglike necklines on some gowns. After all, every trip leads to a few souvenirs that make you wonder what you were thinking.</p></div>"
168,spring,2009,s2009,nina-ricci,"Olivier Theyskens' collection for Nina Ricci was like watching the performance of a long piece of self-referential romantic poetry. It's a world of his own, and to fully appreciate it, you need to know what's gone before in his work: his love of Edwardiana and tailcoats; the fluttery, flyaway cutting; the delicate prints and the dusty, organic woodland-floor palettes he likes.</p><p>This season, he said he was ""inspired by dance and dresses that each evolved their own shape, short in the front and long in the back."" Though there were some of the flange-sided, jodhpurlike pants Theyskens has been developing for the past few seasons and a sighting or two of his signature jackets (like an off-white crackle leather with Victoriana sleeves, or one that was made from blue-gray chiffon), most of the show was devoted to a long sequence of trail-y dresses. Essentially, it was a single silhouette, with a high collar, leg-of-mutton sleeves, and skirts cut away to show long lengths of leg, clad in sheer black tights, walking on high-heeled pumps.</p><p>As the dresses came and went on a long runway, the vista of floating trains and looped-up demi bustles had a certain cinematic beauty and technical ingenuity—georgette panels became fused with hosiery to flow from the leg in movement. In all? Exquisite and ethereal though it was, the vision seemed too limited to take Theyskens' talent anywhere new.</p></div>"
169,spring,2009,s2009,ohne-titel,"Alexa Adams and Flora Gill returned to the airiness of the debut collection that made fashion sit up and take notice a year ago. (One retailer was heard to complain of still being unable to buy the collection because of another's exclusive.) Armed with ideas about what Gill called ""the sculptural form of body,"" they used the play between translucence and opacity to define a shape. They began with lean blazers inset with white mesh—an interesting idea that didn't quite gel—and skinny pants bandaged with a strip of fabric on each leg.</p><p>But, as Gill explained backstage, the collection was about the hard and the soft, and not everything was so strict. Skirts and lower halves of dresses in bias-cut layers of sheer chiffon looked almost cloudlike. Though suiting is their first love, the duo appears to be more interested in pushing knitwear, which they first delved into with Fall's boldly colored intarsia sweaters. They carried out their body-con concept with further iterations of their graphically contoured intarsia, but it was the gorgeous, drapey twinsets and the finale dresses of intricately plaited silk and cotton cord that won the day. When it works, Ohne Titel has a spare, sharp-edged elegance that's reminiscent of Adams' onetime boss Helmut Lang.</p></div>"
170,spring,2009,s2009,organic-by-john-patrick,"""I like to think of it as 'Dust Bowl creativity,' "" the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist John Patrick said of his most ambitious collection to date, a sun-bleached-and-faded homage to thirties prairie life. The Depression was an era, he said, of ""crazy resourcefulness,"" and Okie spirit ran through his wearable mix of gingham dobby-pleated blouses, faded cuffed shorts, recycled polyester trousers, and well-tailored but unconfining blazers. Cotton voile tops with ruffle trim were left sleeveless, the idea being that back in WPA days, leftover fabric would be scrimped, saved, and used to make, say, a much-needed pair of pants. What makes all this more than just some design conceit is Organic's ethical focus. Seventy percent of the line is made entirely from sustainable materials right here in the U.S., with the organic knitwear produced by Patrick's cottage-industry artisans in Peru. The jewelry, which echoed the folksy mood while simultaneously upping the sophistication level several notches, was done in collaboration with Fallon designer Dana Lorenz: A tangle of fabric scraps, chains, and scavenged lockets were done up as necklaces, bracelets, and rings. ""I'm not making fashion,"" Patrick asserted before the show. ""I'm just making clothes."" Well, yes, but—luckily for him (and his workers)—this isn't actually Oklahoma, and a New York audience knows fashion when it sees it.</p></div>"
171,spring,2009,s2009,oscar-de-la-renta,"The first look out, a color-blocked and belted maillot worn by a model who was nothing but legs, suggested that things might go in a bold new direction chez de la Renta this season. But that short, sharp opening salvo was quickly followed by more familiar Oscar-isms: the crisp white blouse with the dirndl skirt, the soft-structure pantsuit, the navy or black cocktail sheath—much of it accessorized with brooches, multistrand necklaces, and drop earrings. Among the show's most compelling pieces were Coco Rocha's white coat with super-graphic navy harlequin embroidery and her strapless peplum gown made from the same high-contrast materials. There were also plenty of luxurious fabrics to swoon over, such as the gray, blue, and silver brocade of a short-sleeve sway-back coat, or the painterly floral print of a silk faille strapless gown.</p><p>Everything was perfectly beautiful, maybe a bit too much so. You wanted to see de la Renta loosen up, play more to the J.Lo crowd (the pop diva's appearance caused quite a commotion) and less to the ladies who lunch. After all, he doesn't have to work for the latter's devotion; he owns it. The first step is to pare back on some of the heavy jewelry and the second is to leave the weekend bags in the showroom. That way, the clothes can do the talking.</p></div>"
172,spring,2009,s2009,ossie-clark,"Rebirthing the Ossie Clark label as a twenty-first-century concern was always going to be a tough one. In many ways, it's the lower-budget British equivalent of the conundrum confronting Halston in New York—except in this case, the Israeli designer Avsh Alom Gur has at least been given a second stab at it. This season was his first proper runway show, and what was up there only served to outline the difficulties in appeasing the hot (and potentially indignant) emotions roused among the over-fifties who loved Ossie in the seventies, while also trying to pique the interest of new generations for whom the name is only vaguely recognizable.</p><p>Oddly enough, some of the better parts of the collection—minimal, fluid dresses, falling from the shoulders in solid colors like damson or gray—came over more like last season's Halston than an Ossie homage. True, vintage-reference spotters might have been pleased by the soft grass-green jumpsuit with a bloused waistline and ruffle neck or a shorts version in orange (just enough of them and believably right for now). On the other hand, anyone who owns a treasured Ossie scattered with one of his wife Celia Birtwell's delicately romantic prints would have been nonplussed by the desultory, schematic flowers on Gur's offerings. (It wouldn't be right to want a Celia copy, since she's very much alive and working in her own right. But then, anything done in the name of her late husband surely deserves something with more verve and character, even if it's wholly different.) The fillers in the shape of simple cowl-necked dresses and knits didn't help clarify matters. It's not that they didn't look like Ossie Clark—they didn't look like anything. At a time when women are looking to make every purchase matter, that lack of identity—either old or new—is a problem.</p></div>"
173,spring,2009,s2009,paul-smith,"There are still plenty of people who question the wisdom of a Paul Smith collection for women. The problem is that womenswear doesn't really play into his strengths, given that his hugely successful menswear line is such an expression of his own appetites and idiosyncrasies. Spring 2009 was inspired by an exhibition of British Orientalist art that just closed at Tate Britain, so there were caftan-inspired long cotton dresses and trousers with the volume of harem pants, and hair and makeup that pointed to a long session in a hammam. A blurred gingham suggested cloth that had been washed and left in the sun. It looked strong in the fitted-then-flaring floor sweeper that closed the show (very Norma Shearer). It was also tiered with floral chiffon in a skirt over a full white petticoat. (There is something so pretty about a full petticoat—a black one also showed up here under a white broderie anglaise dress.)</p><p>The second major influence on the show was Smith's own tailoring, which meant that an ivory coat with black trim ""started out Orientalist, ended up Chanel"" (his words). Tailored pieces included a little tap-shorts suit and a cotton drill jacket with a pair of those voluminous pants. While it's unlikely that this new collection will change the minds of the doubters, it was Smith's best edited and most coherent women's show to date.</p></div>"
174,spring,2009,s2009,peter-jensen,"To fully appreciate the Peter Jensen experience, you need to rummage around on your seat and read the program notes, rather than spend the 20 minutes preshow trying to look cool or chatting to your neighbor. This time, what we got was a script-spoof on Hannibal Lecter verbally sparring with Clarice Starling, in which it becomes chillingly obvious that he knows absolutely everything there is to know about the film costumes of Jodie Foster: ""The bouncy young girl in <em>Freaky Friday</em>, the street-walker of <em>Taxi Driver</em>, the feisty teen in <em>Foxes</em>… This collection looks like you, Clarice.""</p><p>This is only the latest in Jensen's series of fan letters to oddly chosen American heroines. In other seasons he's had crushes on Sissy Spacek, Tina Barney, and the crazed female characters of John Waters' films—but unless you want to draw a complete blank, it's always better to know what he's on about in advance. In this case, it was androgynous eighties tailoring, red-and-white football stripe T-shirt dresses and twinsets, gray sweats, and forties flower-print dresses. Squint at the floral bustier dresses, the high-waist trousers, and bad shoulder-pad jackets, and you could start filling in the Jodie Foster crossword: this one from <em>The Accused</em>, that from <em>The Hotel New Hampshire</em>, the other from <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. To be perfectly honest, though, sans prior intelligence, it was just another collection styled with a mild nod toward the eighties. Compared to some of Jensen's previous Summer collections, it missed his usual sunny bounce.</p></div>"
175,spring,2009,s2009,peter-pilotto,"In a season when too many so-so, green, and frankly unprepared young designers have been jostling for attention on London runways, Peter Pilotto outclassed the lot at a stroke. From the twisted and draped dresses to the molded jackets, every piece in the collection—even the ones that appeared to be in one-color fabrics—was treated to print effects derived from butterfly wings and the look of natural mineral deposits. The success of it, though, was the way Pilotto managed to control all that surface interest into clothes that looked so special, modern, and uncontrived that many in the audience were wondering just how quickly they could race backstage to place a personal order.</p><p>The secret behind this apparent overnight success is that it's nothing of the kind. The label has been around for a couple of years, and there are two heads behind the scenes: Pilotto himself, an Austrian who graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 2004 and specializes in prints, and Christopher De Vos, who was formerly at Vivienne Westwood and has a genius for draping a dress. Since they began working together, they've developed a distinct signature, certainty about what they're doing, and the know-how to achieve it. (The collection is already selling on net-a-porter.com and at Matches in London, and to give a flavor of the label's insider fan base, model and Jefferson Hack's significant other Anouck Lepère wore one of Pilotto's galaxy-print tunic dresses from last season to a Lanvin dinner the night before the up-and-comer's presentation.) Pilotto is the only designer to be selected this season for a New Generation-sponsored runway show. Quality, not quantity, is what counts when it comes to promoting talent.</p></div>"
176,spring,2009,s2009,peter-som,"How did Peter Som imagine his girl for Spring? Staggering around the desert, being revived at an oasis, watching the sunset, and then meeting her Moroccan lover, he said in a preshow interview. Hot plot, but Som's not in the business of dressing Harlequin romance heroines, and his focused—if somewhat safe—collection stuck to a story line that his customers and maybe even foundering Blass-ites could relate to.</p><p>Though Som described this as a ""sexier"" season than any he's done before, he is still a romantic at heart. The only real frisson of raciness was provided by the Bruno Frisoni shoes; the clothes, as always (a black-and-white minidress, for instance, or a printed-and-beaded coat at the end of the show), remained appealingly ladylike. Some of the skillful <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> embellishments might have been a bit literal-minded, but there was a youthful, siroccolike freshness to a rose-colored washed-suede shirtdress or a flowing silk seersucker number—pieces that were essentially all-American.</p></div>"
177,spring,2009,s2009,phi,"Phi is slowly but surely becoming a force to be reckoned with. The label was founded in 2004 by Susan Dell and has been designed since its second season by Andreas Melbostad. This year it ran its first ad campaign, with a nod to Vargas girls, and debuted a Resort collection. Early next year it will open up its second shop, in Los Angeles. ""We started feeling that we had built a nice foundation and that people started to relate to the image and product in a good way,"" Melbostad explained modestly, ""and we felt comfortable and confident to deliver more.""</p><p>Speaking of which, Melbostad's Spring collection was one of his strongest yet. Over the past four years Phi has experimented alternately with lingerie and aggressive tailoring. This season, the balance between the two was at its most harmonious. As his jackets demonstrated, Melbostad didn't totally abandon his preoccupation with the eighties, but his engineering and construction were ""much softer,"" as he himself put it, ""not as body-con, and a little bit looser and more relaxed.""</p><p>Loosely inspired by motocross racing and works in glass by Ettore Sottsass—the founder of the currently highly trendy haute-eighties Memphis design collective—Melbostad jigsaw-puzzled together soft, pale colors (opal, petal, mint) and fabrics of different weights (georgette, mesh). Paneled dresses with intricate boudoir pleating and fine tucks were worn over zip-bottomed skinny pants that looked like an Egyptian mummy's leggings. (Trust us, they were hot.)</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""p5z9bo""></div></div><p>Admittedly, the harem pants and jodhpurs are unlikely to look as cool on an ordinary human as they did on the models. But beyond that, there were plenty of beautifully made pieces that are sure to race out of the NYC and L.A. stores.</p></div>"
178,spring,2009,s2009,philosophy,"<em>Sporty</em> isn't a word that springs to mind when you think of Alberta Ferretti, a refined woman who creates refined clothes. But suddenly there was sporty, all over her Spring Philosophy collection.</p><p>The Italian designer zoomed in on the parka, reimagining it with subtle yet sparkly embellishments and adding straps so that the models could wear them suspended, capelike, from their shoulders. Underneath were ensembles that were deliberate studies in contrast: plenty of lovely, prototypical Ferretti dresses—the loveliest in a maxi length—done in subtle color combinations or Indian prints and topped with beaded corsetlike harnesses (a nod to her interest in the Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema). The dresses, though, were as unsurprising as they were accomplished. What gave the collection its panache was the combination of the expected and the unexpected. Military touches also added to the frisson of something new afoot. There were some really great army-green pants and shorts that proved Philosophy can, indeed, be just as right for the kind of customer who gets collared on the sidewalk by street-style photographers as they are for the kind of customer who gets shot by Patrick McMullan.</p></div>"
179,spring,2009,s2009,pollini,"A new British team has taken over at Pollini, the design label that grew out of an old, established Italian shoe brand. Jonathan Saunders, the Scottish proponent of graphic modernist print, is designing the clothes, and Nicholas Kirkwood—a rising talent with a hot line of his own—the shoes. In a brisk presentation of 27 looks (quick-march, and staged three times so audiences could flow in and out within 15 minutes), the duo framed a breezy snapshot of what's to come. ""I started three months ago, so this is just the beginning,"" said Saunders. ""But I just thought it should be light and feminine, with a positivity about it.""</p><p>Saunders worked with dots and stripes, branching into pastel swirls in dresses cut with multilayered skating skirts or standout origami folds (like some of the shapes in his own collection, but softer). Kirkwood followed through with color-blocked suede and patent heels in lime, cobalt, black, and white, followed by high loafers with chunky tassels and inserts of polka dots. The best in the lineup, though, was the crisp monochrome tailoring for day: a jacket with Bermuda-length city shorts and a neat trench in black and white spots, and a gray menswear long-line jacket with collars and cuffs in piqué shirting material. It remains to be seen which tack the Saunders-Kirkwood team will take when they've had a chance to settle in, but if they're smart enough to keep up the quick and effective staging of this first show, they'll be doing time-deprived press and buyers a welcome favor.</p></div>"
180,spring,2009,s2009,ports-1961,"Tia Cibani, raised in Vancouver, was inspired by the totem poles of the Pacific Northwest, and the lovely live soundtrack for her Ports 1961 runway show was provided by her fellow Canadians the Cowboy Junkies. It was easy to forget, if only for a minute, that we were in midtown Manhattan. With an eagle eye for layering, Cibani kept the long-tall lines suggested by her theme versatile. Skirts in cotton tulle over silk slips looked particularly nice, the best done in a lovely crocus shade of purple; lots of tucks and pleats were incorporated to add horizontal interest. The colorful, rubberlike ropes of fabric on a skirt and dress or two were probably a misstep, and a burlap fringe (which, like a totem pole, will probably always look a little out of place in New York City) weighed down a few other looks. The rest of the collection was light and airy: A tighter edit would have kept the focus on the pieces that were truly beautiful and unusual.</p></div>"
181,spring,2009,s2009,prada,"Miuccia Prada had a sound bite for her Spring collection. ""It's primitive,"" she said, ""going back to what counts."" And what counts most in a back-to-basics time, when most of us will need truly visceral temptation to get us out and shopping? Why, glamour and eroticism, of course. When the chips are down, there is no one who can turn up the thermostat of subversive sexual provocation quite as high as Mrs. Prada. Her girls, their skin glistening as if on a fevered summer's night, might have been passing through on their way to or from lovers' assignations, their clothes disarranged in various states of falling-off or looking as if they might do so at any moment. Rumpled and crinkled fabrics have been appearing all over this season, but never with such sly intent. One pull of a trailing drawstring tape and, whoops! A person could find herself half naked. Not that this collection is, of course, at all brassy. From some angles, it can all look like a perfectly innocent summery dishevelment—that is, until there's a glimpse into an open-sided dress, or a cashmere sweater turns to display hospital-tape ties holding the back together (or just about).</p><p>There was something fabulously Italian about all this shameless reveling in femininity. The fifties overtones, with the high chignons, the ruched bras, and swishing rear action in the below-knee pencil skirts, managed to channel the heyday of Cinecittà without cliché. Best of all, this is a collection destined to look even better on a woman with a real body than it does on a teen model. And that, Mrs. Prada surely knows, really is ""what counts.""</p></div>"
182,spring,2009,s2009,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"The late sixties have been popping up here and there on New York's runways, so it wasn't all that surprising to hear Justin Thornton—his partner, Thea Bregazzi, is at home in London expecting their first child—cite <em>Easy Rider</em> and Jimi Hendrix as influences. But if they were reference points, they were loose ones, and the collection fell into two distinct groups: the soft volumes Thornton and Bregazzi have been exploring since they began showing here three seasons ago, and the hard, body-conscious looks that were all the rage in London before they left.</p><p>The show opened with an example of the latter: a white one-shoulder cocktail dress with cutouts at the ribs inset with a wide mesh. Next came a denim-looking silk button-down blouse tucked into matching genie pants with slouchy pockets and fabric pooling at the ankles. Back-and-forth it went like that—tiny dresses in white, red, or black, some with caged backs, laces crisscrossing the shoulder blades, others with mesh slips peeking a few inches below the hem, followed by weightless silk or chiffon cut into drawstring-waist dresses and anoraks that floated on the breeze in the model's wake. Thornton and Bregazzi didn't exactly break new ground here, but the sexy clothes should go a ways in raising the London designers' profile stateside.</p></div>"
183,spring,2009,s2009,pringle-of-scotland,"The fact that the air-conditioning konked out at her show added a touch of irony to Clare Waight Keller's pleasant if somewhat lackluster Pringle collection, inspired as it was by David Hockney's swimming-pool paintings. ""I wanted a bit of escapism,"" she said backstage. ""She's a sexier girl, and confident, but it's still easy."" Playing on the company's heritage of knits, Waight Keller rethought the twinset (invented by the Scottish house in the thirties) as a knee-skimming cardigan and matching tank dress with ruffles cascading down the front. She remade the heavy-gauge cable sweater, too, transforming it into a viable summer option by knitting it so loosely that from a distance it looked like lace. Cotton dresses tucked and folded origami-style at the neckline and the waist came decorated with brushstroke prints in cobalt and turquoise, while simple white shifts were densely embroidered in black, blue, and gray for a 3-D effect. A boyishly offhand touch was added by engineer-stripe Henleys, cardigans, and full-cropped pants—but elsewhere the embellishments were a bit overwrought. As cool as the blues were and as light and transparent as the gauzy knits looked, they couldn't stir the air in the room, nor did they rouse much of a reaction from the crowd.</p></div>"
184,spring,2009,s2009,proenza-schouler,"Say good-bye to last season's frills. For Spring, Proenza Schouler switched gears. ""It's much tougher,"" said Jack McCollough before a show that carried a strong eighties vibe in the form of big shoulders, high-waisted tapering pants, parachute silks, and more jumpsuits than you could count. ""It's not so much about toughness,"" corrected his partner, Lazaro Hernandez, ""as it is about confidence."" He could've been talking about the duo's frame of mind as much as the clothes themselves. The money they made selling a portion of their company to the Valentino Group last year has not only given them opportunities—they launched a full-scale accessories collection at today's show—it's also freed them to take risks. Witness those accessories. There wasn't a plain-Jane pump in the bunch; instead, fuzzy bedroom slippers came with heels that looked like giant drill bits. And there were new mirrored versions of the cool, round sunglasses that every second editor has been sporting this week.</p><p>Blouses and coats with dolman sleeves, the selvedges exposed on the outside of the arm seams, were just as fearless, and they were worn by a parade of models with long hair cascading down one side of the face à la Jerry Hall. It made for some striking imagery, though at times the wearability of the clothes clearly suffered for all the high concepts. Luckily, that wasn't the whole story: After all, these It boys have It girls like Mary-Kate Olsen and Nicole Richie to keep in signature bra-cup tops (this season, they were rendered in black leather) and stretchy knit dresses. As for those jumpsuits—by day, worn belted over sheer, sleeveless button-downs, and by night stitched in swirls of silver or black and white bugle beads (very <em>Last Days of Disco</em>)—they could very well be a surprise hit at retail.</p></div>"
185,spring,2009,s2009,rachel-comey,"Midtown Manhattan in July may not be the most obvious place to look for enlightenment, but Rachel Comey found inspiration aplenty for her troupe of quirky, playful girls in the midst of an urban heat wave. A mishmash of bright prints provided a bit of tropical escapism, while neatly cinched waists and an overall hip-hugging silhouette made for a more overtly sexy look than Comey has shown in the past. When the prints weren't played against each other—mostly to charming effect—they popped against a refreshing palette of pool blue and chartreuse. In one notable look, slim little shorts were slipped under a pouf skirt and topped with a plum knit tank, giving the option of volume and providing a cheeky look at layering. Backstage, the queen of quirk, Parker Posey, declared the collection ""gorgeous!""—and, for a carefree kind of downtown girl, it was.</p></div>"
186,spring,2009,s2009,rachel-roy,"She has had a big summer: A baby, her second with husband Damon Dash, arrived in May; then, in June, Jones Apparel Group acquired a 50 percent stake in her three-year-old label. The developments seem to have put Roy in a philosophical mood. The oft-quoted Gandhi dictum, ""Be the change you want to see in the world,"" was printed on her program notes and whimsically stitched in French on a narrow sheath. The abundance of embellishments—gold studding, heart embroidery—notwithstanding, Roy generally takes a realist's approach to fashion, and for Spring she said she wanted to mine the territory between elegance and ease. Sometimes the balance felt forced: Detachable tulip skirts worn over narrow pencil skirts (one in a heavy black lace, another in a tribal pattern) promised versatility, but looked stiff and tricky to sit in. A slouchy, backless T-shirt dress in silk jersey, by contrast, came off just right. And her nude evening pajamas are a languidly sexy take on the ubiquitous jumper—just the thing an It girl might choose for a fashion week party. In fact, Roy said she planned to wear them to the <em>Interview</em> magazine launch later that night.</p></div>"
187,spring,2009,s2009,rag-bone,"David Neville and Marcus Wainwright continue to put down roots here in NYC—the design partners opened their first-ever Rag &amp; Bone store on Christopher Street earlier this week—but for Spring it was their native England that captured the designers' imaginations. Specifically, they took their cues from their birthplace's musical subcultures—punk, mod, ska, etc.—and the uniforms associated with each. On the men's side, it translated quite literally; there were exposed zippers, braces, and precisely cuffed pants. On the women's side, it informed a silhouette: fitted jackets and checked button-downs with matching narrow ties, worn over stovepipe pants tapering to a tight ankle above stacked heels. It also spiked the mood: tough and rough around the edges, thanks to studded cuffs and belts and stringy hair, not to mention the dangerously short hemlines on miniskirts and clingy dresses.</p><p>There were some great pieces to pull out of the mix—tiny washed-leather jackets, one in black, another in caution yellow; a tweedy pantsuit; the carbon-blue jeans—but the show fell short on a couple of fronts. For one, the British music scene is a favorite point of reference for designers, and even if Neville and Wainwright have more of a right than most to explore it, there's bound to be a sense that it's all been done before. More surprisingly, the fit on one or two of their double-breasted jackets looked off. For a more consistent sense of the good work that this duo is capable of, head first to their new store.</p></div>"
188,spring,2009,s2009,ralph-lauren,"Down came last season's gold antlers and up went a Moroccan lamp: Ralph Lauren looked to North Africa for Spring. For many in his audience today, it's a place that automatically conjures up images and thoughts of Yves Saint Laurent. But Lauren has been in business for 41 years now, and in that time he's mined every continent but Antarctica for inspiration, so if this was in part a respectful nod in the late Parisian designer's direction, it was mostly a fresh look at some of Lauren's own biggest hits.</p><p>The show opened with a khaki camp shirt that looked like it had just come back from safari (one sleeve was ripped at the shoulder) and beaded gold harem pants slung with two belts. Interspersed among the other silk-satin takes on that slouchy, relaxed silhouette—which happens to be right in step with the season—were bronze or white linen suits worn with matching shirts and metallic ties, as well as great, swaggering trenches in buttery leather and parachute silk. Indiana Jones hats, turbans (some of them too literally over-the-top), and pearl-and-emerald sautoirs added to the show's adventurous spirit.</p><p>The theme continued into evening. A silk-linen gauze strapless gown in olive drab might be just the thing for a candlelit dinner in the Atlas Mountains, and shades of colonial Africa could be seen in a thirties-ish cream silk dress. A black silk evening jumpsuit, on the other hand, looked utterly urban and modern. Ubah Hassan, a model from Somalia, resplendent in a gold lamé column gown and beaded headdress, closed the show. Kudos to Lauren for addressing the diversity issue on the runways, and for a collection well done.</p></div>"
189,spring,2009,s2009,ralph-rucci,"There was both rain and rush hour to contend with, but the Rucci faithful, including Amy Fine Collins and Martha Stewart, all made it to see their guy—now back in New York after a two-season decampment to Paris. Today he further developed the study in transparency and texture he began in his Fall 2008 collection. It's a clear move forward for a designer who can get bogged down by architecture and overlooked by those who don't consider that their cup of fashion tea.</p><p>Rucci applied his fresh notions throughout—first to his classics, lightening up the arcing seams of sculptural suits and dresses with horsehair insets, and then pushing into new territory with geometric insets of wool on sheer tulle. The effect was both modern and, yes, kind of sexy. Rucci's Resort collection, shown in June, included some beautiful dresses that would appeal to the junior set. There were more here, including polished white shirtdresses, coquettishly winking bits of skin through sliced seams. A standout black sequin jacket and skinny, floor-length skirt had a dark, louche appeal, while a fuchsia party dress with a back of riblike cutouts almost had the sci-fi edge of McQueen. These numbers—each a nice counterpoint to the concept-laden, intellectual heft that gets the likes of Stewart and Collins clapping—may help Rucci broaden his audience.</p></div>"
190,spring,2009,s2009,rebecca-taylor,"""She's a world traveler,"" Rebecca Taylor said backstage of her Spring girl. ""She's cool, carefree, and unencumbered."" The result was a mishmash of ditsy floral tea dresses, embroidered Swiss-dot tunics, and jodhpurs, with sequins and leopard print tossed in for good measure. Taylor cited author Karen Blixen as inspiration for the tribal block prints and otherwise international feel of the collection, but the dizzying array of patterns and textures lacked cohesion. Still, these are intended as clothes to make girls feel pretty, and at that level they succeeded. The shoes, bags, and baubles (new for Spring) will almost surely be a hit, most notably a jewel-embellished tan leather shoulder bag and perforated slouchy suede booties.</p></div>"
191,spring,2009,s2009,reem-acra,"You can't have eveningwear without having fantasy. For Spring, Reem Acra wove a tale that began in the attic of a royal castle, the kind of magically cobwebbed place where one might chance upon a forgotten stash of silks and gems.</p><p>The clothes that spun off from Acra's fairy-tale concept were more Taj Mahal than Buckingham Palace. There was serious electric color here—turquoise, aqua, tangerine, and flamingo pink—and a pirate's plunder of jeweled beading. Silhouettes ran the gamut. For every shoulder-baring, body-skimming gown, there was a covered-up dupioni tunic and ball skirt for the mother of the rani.</p><p>But Acra, a veteran of the bridal business, has experience enough not to lose touch with reality, or the real-world needs of clients. Among the chapters in her storybook was a plain-but-pretty tan jersey column and a relatively simple breezy lemon-chiffon frock. The collection had its moments of overexuberant volume, and one ""Huh?"" moment with a boldly striped black-and-white pantsuit. Well, you never know what you'll find in the attic.</p></div>"
192,spring,2009,s2009,requiem,"After stumbling a bit with a Fall collection that was heavy on the disco references, Raffaele Borriello and Julien Desselle got themselves back on track with today's Requiem show. They haven't abandoned the ruffles, bows, and other couture treatments they like to indulge in, but working with the perhaps unlikely twin inspirations of Truman Capote's Black and White Ball and christening garments, they came up with something considerably lighter. For that, credit the crisp black, white, and silver palette as well as the short, leggy silhouettes. The belted cocktail dresses the duo showed have had many precedents this season (not that that will hurt at retail), but Borriello and Desselle also came up with a couple of unique numbers: a drop-waist sixties shift with black lace detailing at the high neck and a sheath with dégradé metal beading.</p></div>"
193,spring,2009,s2009,reyes,"Before his show, José Ramón Réyes said his Spring collection was designed for a gallerina, a downtown art-world type who ""isn't afraid of a little geek-chic."" She'll have to be arty to pull off his asymmetrically draped dresses and the bra- and panty-revealing sheer neon jumpsuits that poufed out at the hips. This was a bold new direction for Réyes, who just last season moved from the contemporary to the entry-level designer price point, and not long before that was making user-friendly, on-trend sportswear. ""Cute"" is the word that comes to mind in connection with Réyes' earlier efforts, and the camp shirts he showed today fit that bill, with their epaulets at the shoulders and little ties at the neck. Most of his new offerings, though, could more aptly be described as challenging. That doesn't mean there isn't a girl out there for his multi-fabric collage dresses and the YSL-under-Pilati vests and drop-crotch tapered pants—but she probably isn't the one who's been following his career so far.</p></div>"
194,spring,2009,s2009,richard-chai-love,"Richard Chai has a love of ideas—an intellectualism, you might say, a taste for a complicated backstory—that has sometimes marginalized him in this city. But he's learning how to channel his energies (as well as his slightly obsessive nature) into clothes that are truly special.</p><p>The Spring collection was chic and ethereal and brimming with colorful prints, a ""joyous"" (his word) journey toward the light after a dark-edged Fall outing. Chai began on a masculine note that echoed the cool layered-jacket-and-slouchy-pant silhouette of last season. This time, a sharp ivory sleeveless jacket was worn over a creamy embroidered tank and linen trousers.</p><p>He's always had a knack for the sporty and boyish, of course—what was remarkable here was the buoyant femininity that followed. You didn't need an elaborate explanation to understand a lovely bell-sleeve dress of distressed sequins with winking hints of contrasting thread. With Bryant Park days blurring together and one runway outing sometimes seeming like an echo of another you've just seen, Chai's unique voice is beginning to ring out in the crowd.</p></div>"
195,spring,2009,s2009,richard-nicoll,"Minimalist elegance is a concept that's slipped from view since the late nineties, but in London it's marching back. The standard bearer is Richard Nicoll, whose show re-energized the monochrome aesthetics of clean, sporty dressing by drenching it in great doses of color-blocked tangerine, cyclamen, nude, and aqua. Nicoll said he'd been influenced by early Helmut Lang and (not so obviously) the late fifties, but if he meant the ease of mid-century American sportswear it makes sense.</p><p>It was uplifting to watch a young designer find something new to say about the validity of T-shirt-and-pants dressing and think about simple but impactful combinations of separates. That might mean an oversize T-shirt top in blocks of nude organza and pink silk tucked into a long, slim cyclamen skirt, or a tank with a one-shoulder toga drape over narrow pants. It's not the easiest thing to make borderline bad-taste colors seem cool, but there was something in this collection that palpably moved the audience. Likely, it has to do with Nicoll's growing into himself and acquiring the confidence to let his Australian understanding of relaxed, hot-weather lifestyles come through. If so, it's an epiphany that may well connect him with underserved customers in warm climates all over the world. After all this, Nicoll ended his show with a surprise finale of his Richard Nicoll Shirt second line, which has quietly developed into a cute collection of cotton dresses and shorts. Impressive on all fronts.</p></div>"
196,spring,2009,s2009,rick-owens,"The sensation of filing past the black-lipped, pale-skinned gatekeepers at Rick Owens' show is akin to that of gaining entry to a sect gathering. You sit down, a whoosh of dry ice fills the room, and there they are on the runway, Owens' bewimpled women in black, or, as he named them this time, the ""Priestesses of Longing.""</p><p>Somehow the vaporous ritualism of the beginning of Owens' show seemed to link up with the primitivism (cave people, tribalism, that sort of thing) that's emerging from the fashion ether this season. Still, it's not an idea to get too spooked by: As strange as the headgear and trash bag wrapped footwear may be on his runway, the clothes call to a far wider following than the members of a mere insider cult.</p><p>That may not be particularly obvious from the nude-paneled, back-baring halters and floppy all-in-ones that came at the start. But Owens' real secret is the fact that among the twists, turns, cutouts, and asymmetries of his (mainly) black bias-cut design, there's so much that's so wearable. With this collection, he filtered an almost old-school couture elegance into the mix: a jacket knotted into the torso, a high-waisted A-line coat, chic trumpet-leg pants, sleeves cut with jutting fins in the upper arm, and something that looked like a cross between a bandanna knot and a couture bow as closures.</p></div>"
197,spring,2009,s2009,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli wasn't completely back in glamazon mode today, but neither was this the dreamy, almost decorous collection of last Spring. In fact, it was a bit all over the place. Out first were three-piece suits—that'd be jacket, short shorts or mini, and exposed bra (now a bona fide Milan trend)—rendered in bandanna prints. Equally abbreviated bustier dresses came with faience prints in the front and ""faux cul"" bustles in the back. There were even some Tom Ford-era Gucci clingy jersey numbers with cutout hips in the mix. On the sweeter side, printed chiffon parachute dresses and strapless debutante gowns floated out with a few off-the-waist dresses. It was the latter that got the fashion pack so excited last September; this time they were sheer.</p><p>The only things missing were Cavalli's signature animal prints, slightly ironic given their omnipresence elsewhere in Milan. So, how to make sense of it all? You could call it a best-of collection, but that would be being generous. In the end, it looked like there were too many cooks in the kitchen.</p></div>"
198,spring,2009,s2009,rock-republic,"There's something fun about watching the likes of Chanel Iman, Freja Beha Erichsen, and Hye Park get unabashedly sexed up and stomp down the runway in big hair and even more towering stilettos. Showing to an audience that included Mary-Kate Olsen, Rock &amp; Republic asked the models to work it for a full 54 looks today. A series of super-short bandage dresses that had been partied up with a ruffle here, some ruching there was followed by second-skin jeans (""skinny bitch,"" as they were called in the program notes, and they certainly looked like the latter to put on). These were topped off with rock-ready blazers and shiny tops. The take-no-prisoners attitude it requires to pull off clothes like these is an admirable quality in its own right.</p></div>"
199,spring,2009,s2009,rodarte,"Poor Abbey Lee—the Aussie model who took a catwalk tumble—wasn't the only one earthbound at the Rodarte show today: Kate and Laura Mulleavy turned their obsessive interest in landscape art into the starting point for their futuristic, apocalyptic Spring collection.</p><p>Many creative influences could be read into the clothes, but the most instructive clue to decoding them came from Laura Mulleavy, who commented that land art blossomed only after humans began space travel and ""people began to see the Earth from a different perspective."" The Mulleavy sisters sometimes seem to view fashion from just such a radical vantage point: Certainly no other designers on the New York schedule have such an idiosyncratic take—and that is both what makes them so interesting and their Achilles' heel.</p><p>The gorgeous dyed Grecian gowns of Fall returned for Spring, embellished with crystals and in an Olafur Eliasson-inspired palette of violet, orange, white, and blue. Also familiar were the knits, but this time composed of a mélange of materials, including leather and chains, so decayed-looking as to almost defy the label ""sweaters."" These were worn with the most salable pieces the sisters have ever shown: circular lace-pleated skirts in a shape familiar to any Catholic school student.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""czxby8""></div></div><p>Drama and intellectual content, along with an otherworldly loveliness, may always be the Rodarte thing, but more down-to-earth-wearable pieces would be welcome. ""Beautiful androids"" (as the models were referred to backstage) make for great editorial, but flesh-and-blood women like Natalie Portman, Sarah Sophie Flicker, and Dr. Lisa Airan, who all sat in the front row, need to be able to imagine themselves wearing the clothes out into the big, beautiful world.</p></div>"
200,spring,2009,s2009,roksanda,"Roksanda Ilincic has carved out a reputation as London's avant-garde dressmaker—following somewhere in the slipstream of Lanvin and Saint Laurent. She uses a limited number of materials—satin, silk, ribbon, and handmade haberdashery flowers—relying more on an artless happenstance of wrapping and tying than precision-cutting and finishing. No surprise, then, that her Spring show was much the same as always—except that for the first time her venue was a lofty gallery space rather than a cozy tearoom or restaurant.</p><p>The new location meant her models were free to waft past at a distance, trailing fuchsia satin bathrobes and puffs of net. ""I wanted to be more calm this season, so I chose slightly less bright colors like nude, plum, and gray,"" she said. ""And, oh, some peonies that look as if they've been nuked."" That quirky sensibility translated into exaggerations of 3-D floral embroideries (one made up an entire hooded cape) and phases of white tulle, suggestive of bridalwear. The downsides? The loss of intimacy, and the way the space seemed to expose Ilincic's lack of couture skills.</p></div>"
201,spring,2009,s2009,rue-du-mail,"Emmanuelle Seigner, Joana Preiss, and Zoe Cassavetes might've been sporting their undone Paris best—hair that hasn't seen a brush in days, scarves, and boots—but Martine Sitbon's two-year-old Rue du Mail label is increasingly becoming about the ornate details. Nearly every surface was worked, from the micro-pleated panels on organza and leather jackets to the origami tucks and folds on strapless dresses worn over sheer knit tanks to another take on those 3-D shapes that have turned into such a big Spring trend. These last appeared on the back of a khaki trench, at the shoulders of a short-sleeved jacket, and at the hips of skirts and dresses.</p><p>There were some keepers: The closing dress, with its collage of stripes and beads and cutouts, could've gone horribly wrong but really came together. As a whole, though, the collection was <em>rather</em> overwhelming, and the eye sought relief. It came in the form of a quiet-by-comparison peplum jacket in black satin, and sexy cigarette pants—a look that's definitely more those front-row girls' speed.</p></div>"
202,spring,2009,s2009,ruffian,"Last season's boarding-school girl has run away to become a groupie. One part Kate Hudson in <em>Almost Famous</em>, another part Kate Moss at Glastonbury, she wears button-front tunics and maxi dresses in multicolored French lace. She pairs bronze or fuchsia crushed-velvet short shorts—and we mean <em>short</em>—with mutton-sleeve blouses and studded suede vests. And she has a thing for destroyed denim, faded and frayed by hand, and cut into tiny fitted jackets and blanket coats. (Oh, and a thing for fringed-suede Christian Louboutin ankle boots. You'll never see a pair of rubber wellies at a Ruffian show because their clients aren't the type to muck around in the mud.)</p><p>As groovy as that denim was, some of the other pieces looked a bit costumey, as if the models were playing dress up in their grandmother's closets. The show's best numbers—floaty tiers of chiffon in dégradé pastels—didn't look like Monterey circa 1967, they looked like today.</p></div>"
203,spring,2009,s2009,sabyasachi,"A big name back home in India, the Calcutta-based designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee is less well-known abroad, but it appears that's starting to change: Not only has he been invited to participate in the <em>International Herald Tribune</em>'s ""Sustainable Luxury"" conference in New Delhi this December, but he presented his third Spring show in New York to a full house.</p><p>Indian autumn, it turns out, relates weather-wise to American spring, so Mukherjee adapts the collection he shows in Mumbai for export West. Backstage, he was armed with the requisite list of references (a lot of French names: Paul Gauguin, Edith Piaf, etc.), but admitted that in the process of creation ""inspiration gets completely blurred. I just believe in making good clothes."" True to his word, the show was full of covetable separates, many with exquisite hand embroideries, quilting, and beading that could only be done in India but have true global appeal. One of his talents is to make seemingly prim silhouettes pop, so the uncharacteristically too-short and too-sexy scalloped pieces hit a false note. But what he was able to do with the dirndl and the classic bow blouse (shown cape-backed and constructed of a mélange of prints) was impressive. They were imbued with an almost French ooh-la-la, suggesting that Mukherjee is becoming increasingly fluent in the international language of fashion.</p></div>"
204,spring,2009,s2009,saint-laurent,"As it faces up to a world of dramatically reconfigured priorities, what action should fashion take to stay relevant? Should designers be paring back, or keep pushing the new? On YSL's runway, that tension surfaced. ""I felt for an extreme simplicity,"" Stefano Pilati said, ""but it has to be feminine and a bit audacious. Lifting the spirits was making sense to me."" His solution was to play it both ways, with Japanese-inflected austerity on the one hand, and no surrender over risk-taking shapes and hotly desirable shoes on the other.</p><p>The Orientalist-modernist mix came out in the towering lacquered chignons and soft, cocooning shapes that had been derived from kimono wrapping and Japanese fishermen's pants. Pilati can claim authority over the drop-crotch trouser: He started it, and now that it's entered the mainstream he's edging it further along into fluid, baglike shorts, rompers, and jumpsuits. If that sounds awful, by the end of the show the concept of a garment that happens to be joined between the knees—worn with buttoned-up shirts or tailored jackets—had gained a degree of visual inevitability that might be a staging post on the way to normality. (Fearless young stylists have already been sporting their own versions of them around the shows this week, so that's another sign.)</p><p>In any case, there were aspects of the show that didn't insist on pushing that particular nether-parts envelope. At some points, Pilati stepped up to answer the call for the kind of reassuring, regular Parisian chic women demand from YSL. An amazing asymmetric black dress with volume gathered up in a drawstring bow in the back did that, as did several pale gray regular pantsuits, and, for someone racier, reworkings of ""Saharien"" jackets with the cross-lacing details running through peplums or up the small of the back.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gce0c""></div></div><p>If it didn't have the slam-dunk, uncompromising fashion stance of Pilati's last collection, the riveting new shoeslatticework grids of leather with metal-mesh heelswere enough to score a huge hit. First, they were walkable; second, they represent a coolly modern collision of the airiness of multi-strapped gladiators with the look of a boot. In a season when so much footwear has limped off runways to muttered protests from female audiences, that point alone puts YSL in the lead.</p></div>"
205,spring,2009,s2009,sari-gueron,"Guo Jingjing, the flawless Chinese diver who has won more medals in her sport than any other woman in Olympic history, was Sari Gueron's muse for Spring. Having logged more than a few hours watching the Summer Games, the designer plunged into a more fitted, athletic silhouette for a change. ""It's sexier for me,"" she said.</p><p>Tanks and slips with Speedo-like racerbacks served as the foundation over which delicate lace tops and silk dresses were worn. A lace tank dress in fuchsia over one such tight black slip would look right on someone like Joy Bryant, who sat in the front row, for a night out. For day, Gueron made the most of a vintage leaf-and-berry print in muted shades of turquoise and dark pink. It turned up on slouchy shorts, but looked best on a one-shoulder cocktail dress with graphic appeal.</p></div>"
206,spring,2009,s2009,shipley-halmos,"""Modern"" and ""new"" were the bywords for Jeff Halmos and Sam Shipley's Spring collection, shown this season at a West Chelsea venue with a century-old restored-wood interior. To pierce that air of antiquity, the duo installed a spray of fluorescent tube lights as a backdrop—aimed, naturally, at injecting some of that electric current into their clothes. But aside from the designers' stated guiding principle of looks that could slip seamlessly from day to night with a platform shoe here and a bauble there, it was difficult to pull out an exact direction that these clothes were headed in. Amid the wide style swings—from retro lady-land with Katharine Hepburn-esque trousers to tough-chic hipsterville in skinny silver pants and a draped-back black tank—there were a few stronger pieces, such as a nautical rope-motif cardigan or the caped trench that opened the show. Shipley and Halmos are clearly having fun with fashion and their many collaborators/friends in New York. It would be nice to see some of that life and personality in their clothes.</p></div>"
207,spring,2009,s2009,sinha-stanic,"There are two interesting subtexts in this particular edition of London fashion week. One is the newfound focus that many designers are displaying. The other is the intriguing range of influences. The two are connected. Look at Fiona Sinha and Aleksandar Stanic's latest collection. They were thinking about the razor-sharp style of teddy girls in the fifties, which inspired a sleeveless jacket and a mean pair of pants, and the bad-girl sheath dress that was the main silhouette. The shapes may have been repetitious, but (some curious draping aside) the leanness of the inspiration trimmed away the fat that confused Sinha-Stanic's last collection.</p><p>It also created a sympathetic context for Fiona and Aleksandar's other theme: the dark energy they'd felt in the work of Peter Doig during his retrospective at the Tate earlier this year. (Seems like the Tate is as seminal as Central Saint Martins in the Spring 2009 collections!) Against an LED screen playing footage of Smashing Pumpkins and Sonic Youth, the mannequins marched in those teddy-tough shapes printed with intimations of catastrophe: lava bursts, palm trees against a blazing sky, cosmic explosions. The clash of a hot-pink jacket and Halloween-orange pants or the vermilion cocktail dress with the panel of chenille lace set in the back were lurid enough to emphasize the notion of dark energy. Focused as they were, Sinha-Stanic mightn't have had a lot to say, but they said it with persuasive conviction.</p></div>"
208,spring,2009,s2009,sonia-rykiel,"Thank goodness for Sonia Rykiel. The Paris legend resuscitated what was becoming a bleak season (blame the markets) with a 40th-anniversary dinner-and-show party that goes down in this reporter's notebook as the most spontaneously exuberant and genuinely fun fashion event in recent history. After a long trek to Saint Cloud and an even longer wait for the entrée, it felt like the night was going to turn into a chore. But by the time three models vamped their way down the elevated runway in metallic silver-and-black striped sweaters and skirts (specifically, that would be somewhere between the opening run of house-signature candy-colored tops and the pearl-embroidered oversize suits and motorcycle jackets), any lingering resentment about the late 11 p.m. start had evaporated.</p><p>During the evening-gown section—long tanks and feathery halters and tiers ruffled to the floor—the guests at Olivier Theyskens' table started tossing roses from the centerpiece at the models. (Other luminaries on hand included Jean Paul Gaultier, Zoe Cassavetes, Emma Watson, and Dita Von Teese.) Soon the runway was covered in flowers the color of Rykiel's dresses. Even that couldn't stop the girls from breaking into a dance party when they came out again in taffeta minidresses. A few even conga-lined it straight into the audience.</p><p>If that had been it, the audience would've left content. But after taking her bow alongside her mother, Sonia's daughter Nathalie grabbed the microphone and announced, ""A birthday without a surprise isn't a birthday. You've been inspiring the world of fashion for 40 years; here's your present. <em>Bon anniversaire, Maman</em>."" Out came 30 more models in Sonia Rykiel looks designed by some of fashion's biggest names. Martin Margiela made a fur chubby the color of Rykiel's flame-red mane. Rodarte's sweater dress read ""Obama."" Jean Paul Gaultier's came attached to giant knitting needles and trailing a ball of yarn. Happy returns, indeed.</p></div>"
209,spring,2009,s2009,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki spent the summer on the island of Crete, and while there found herself thinking of Egypt. ""It's not so far,"" she said. ""I looked at ancient Egyptian costume, and there's something sixties in there you see in a lot of movies on Greek television. But, you know, it's always done in a young and ironic way."" Oddly, Egyptian motifs have been cropping up on several runways this season. In Kokosalaki's case, as she promised, it wasn't exactly the full Tutankhamen deal. Mostly, it was done by allusion: a strong-shouldered jacket and A-line skirt derived from tomb paintings, the pattern on a khaki trench inspired by early hieroglyphics, and a color palette that included lapis lazuli and gold.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was a richness in this collection that Kokosalaki hasn't reached for before. She's always worked with leather, but this season she upgraded, patchworking burnished gold python into boleros, vests, and a top in which a single strap literally snaked across a shoulder like a cobra tail. That more detailed extravagance is a distinct step up and away from the dark, urban collections of the beginning of her career in London, but Kokosalaki is growing up now, reaching new markets and finding herself on the brink of the stage where she can develop her name further. That quiet progress was underlined by the jewelry visible in this collection: Snake-head slave bracelets, cuffs inset with semiprecious stones, and dangling gold earrings and diadems were the first sighting of her new line.</p></div>"
210,spring,2009,s2009,sophie-theallet,"French transplant Sophie Théallet insisted that she wasn't making a political statement with the all-black model casting of her debut show. ""I was thinking about colors, and they look amazing on dark skin, so it came naturally,"" she said. Wearability seems to come naturally to Théallet, too, and it was the nonchalance of the clothes that impressed the most.</p><p>It's well-known that Théallet worked with Azzedine Alaïa for a decade before establishing Motu Tane, a resort line, with François Nars. But it was the influence of the makeup king (and not the king of body con) that was most notable in this extremely summery collection, which featured djellaba shapes, head scarves, crisp cottons circled with bright ribbon stripes, and tropical flowers appliquéd with satin. Anyone looking for shades of Alaïa could find them in the intricately constructed finale dress, but that was really beside the point. Théallet isn't proposing herself as an Alaïa disciple, and she's not interested in making ""a big fashion statement,"" she said. Her fascination is with the mystery of femininity—something French women seem to have a special key to understanding—and a delight in color.</p><p>At least one audience member was captivated. Lou Doillon's take on her compatriot's New York debut? ""It was beautiful and strangely erotic,"" the alluring French actress said (and she ought to know).</p></div>"
211,spring,2009,s2009,strk,"With each new season she shows in New York, Camilla Stærk's vision becomes more refined. Her latest effort, a stark, moody mélange of mostly leather and silk, is her most sophisticated yet. Titled ""The Storyteller,"" the Spring collection was inspired by <em>Out of Africa</em> author Karen Blixen. ""She spent 20 years in Kenya, but Denmark was home,"" said Stærk backstage. ""I wanted to capture both elements of her persona."" The Danish influence rang clear in sleek leather pants and liquid-jersey bodysuits (the latter reworked for a basket-weave effect), as well as an austere ultra-suede strapless dress. The African element was also present, but filtered through Stærk's lens it emerged as a linen racerback tank studded with brass nailheads, and a batik print distorted to the point that it looked like veins. In August Stærk opened her first boutique, in Nolita. The sleek, Scandinavian-looking space (designed by Stærk herself) should be the perfect backdrop for her unique wares.</p></div>"
212,spring,2009,s2009,stella-mccartney,"A report out today says profits at Stella McCartney's company increased sixfold last year. Clearly, her feel-good formula is working, and all the elements were in place at her Spring show: the best soundtrack in Paris (this time including a song from papa, Sir Paul), an arty backdrop (inspired by coloring books and designed by the British artists Dinos and Jake Chapman), and clothes with her trademark mix of effortlessness and sex appeal.</p><p>She started by tweaking her beloved jumpsuits. They came tailored in makeup pink, with deep lapels that plunged to the navel. McCartney's kind of slouchy, slightly oversize tailoring has caught on in a major way: The longer boyfriend jacket with the strong shoulder and the pushed-up sleeve that she showed today over little cocktail dresses or with cropped pants has become a big trend. Her trench coveralls might not be adopted as readily—we don't all have legs like Natasha Poly's.</p><p>But the collection's sexy side came across in plenty of other, more real-world ways. Dévoré sweaters played a demure game of peekaboo, while silk dresses in steely gray took a provocative dip in back. For evening, she kept the silhouette short, sharp, and graphic in black and white. Simply put, she's got cool-girl style down to a science.</p></div>"
213,spring,2009,s2009,stephen-burrows,"There's been much talk about black models in the last few months, but little has been said about black designers. Stephen Burrows, probably America's most famous black designer—a three-time Coty Award winner, member of the Fashion Walk of Fame, and recipient of a CFDA Lifetime Achievement Award—didn't have as large an audience at his show today as he should have.</p><p>In recent years, some of Burrows' collections have been justly criticized for being a bit mired in the past—specifically the seventies, the designer's disco heyday. But this collection, titled ""Afro Summer,"" was his best and most forward-looking in a long time. Asked about the title—and the invitation, which came with an Afro pick—the designer said that he wasn't making a political statement so much as an artistic one: He equated the ""naturalness"" of unstraightened black hair with the natural cottons and silks he used. That's right: Burrows has broken out of his box, wholly abandoning his signature jersey for Resort and using little of it for Spring.</p><p>Fluidity—what he calls a ""feeling for softness""—is still at the core of the designer's work, but this time he sought it through ""wovens."" The focus was on a truly smart series of khaki pieces—including one dress with grommets and another in red with top-stitching and a crumb-catcher collar—that were quintessentially American, fresh, and wearable.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""93b1f""></div></div><p>One of the week's most convincing arguments for the harem pant came here, in a pair of culotte shorts in a brilliant floral print (paging Rihanna). And the finale gowns were simply stunning. Yasmin Warsame closed the show in a mermaid-tailed column with suspended sleeves—this one in jersey—that melded the best of Burrows past and Burrows present. A dress like that deserves its share of the limelight, and so does the man who designed it.</p></div>"
214,spring,2009,s2009,sue-stemp,"Sue Stemp is currently enamored of photographer David Hamilton's gauzy images of flower-bedecked seventies youth as well as captivated by the sly seduction of a John Singer Sargent portrait. The result? Call it Mademoiselle X. The designer's modern-day provocateur is young at heart—note, the rooftop party-cum-presentation was hosted by Tamsin Lonsdale and Arden Wohl, two mischief-making girls on the New York scene—and, as we've come to expect, the clothes were made for cocktails. Among the best pieces were hand-embroidered shorts with tuxedo suiting in cream and black, and delicate silk tops adorned with oversize silk-screened blooms. Working in a neutral palette of ""makeup colors"" (translation: cream, ivory, and rose), Stemp offered romance and raciness. One dress, in fact—short and tiered—would be just as appropriate in the boudoir as on a banquette.</p></div>"
215,spring,2009,s2009,tao,"Tao Kurihara has a very distinctive silhouette: Often it's a little jacket with a lot of action at the neckline and shoulders, worn with an abbreviated bottom like a poufy skirt. She doesn't so much change it each season as couch it within a new reference. For Spring, her point of departure seemed to be Scottish bagpipers' gear. But leave it to this protégé of Rei Kawakubo to keep plaids (too clichéd!) out of the equation.</p><p>The first model exited in a short, sheer royal-blue jacket with frogging and brass buttons over a long, narrow tee and tight breeches, a high, fuzzy busby hat topping it off with tasseled kneesocks and brogues below. Kurihara worked her way through many variations on that idea—some toppers double-breasted, others cutaway in back—with pants hovering above or below the knee, a few done in horizontal stripes. Then, putting aside the uniform concept for a moment, she showed a trio of shrunken button-front shirts in bright, girlish flower prints. There were cheerful pop blooms on sheer plissé kilts, as well as on sweeter versions of the opening look. This was one entirely original Highland fling.</p></div>"
216,spring,2009,s2009,temperley-london,"Last year, the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London mounted an exhibition of the art of book illustration between the 1890's and the 1920's. It was called <em>The Age of Enchantment</em>, and it clearly made an impression on Alice Temperley, whose new collection was a feast of graphic flourishes culled from the work of people like Aubrey Beardsley and Edmund Dulac. The black detailing on a little white bolero, for instance, was evocative of Beardsley's line, while a draped white gown, gathered at the shoulders, looked like something a Dulac maiden might've worn. But the years covered by the exhibition were also the time of Bright Young Things in England and in Hollywood. It was easy to imagine Cecil Beaton's party girls dressing up as Diana the Huntress in one of Temperley's little silk tunics paired with gladiator sandals. And Rudolph Valentino's vampy arm candy would have gravitated toward harem pants in a black and white leopard print.</p><p>Temperley called her collection ""Romantic Odyssey,"" a pretty accurate description of the surfeit of ruffles, flounces, and classical draping. There were still outbreaks of that old Temperley sugariness (a floral romper suit, for instance), but the designer was tempered by a new sophistication. That made this a strong collection with which to return home after several seasons showing in New York.</p></div>"
217,spring,2009,s2009,thakoon,"If pollsters followed fashion, they would surely note a spike in Thakoon Panichgul's approval ratings. Not only did Michelle Obama wear one of the young designer's floral frocks at the Democratic Convention—a real coup—but his patterned pieces have been seen daily at the tents on the backs of editors. For Spring, Panichgul delivered a number of options for dyed-in-the-wool Thakoon-ocrats, among which an organza seamed dress with a surreal print of roses sprouting legs and a black tulle-trimmed trench stood out as surefire hits. But he also took some chances that, while not actually politically incorrect, definitely could not be worn to the White House (Bra-backed apron dresses? Exposed and bound midriffs, anyone?).</p><p>""I always like a tough show,"" Panichgul explained in the run-up to runway day, ""because what I do is more feminine than not, so I like the balance."" Tough, for him, meant sexy. Panichgul used lots of nudes, corsetry, and a kiss print (worked into a fantastic gossamer trench). While the designer is certainly on the money with his contributions to the budding boudoir trend, it wasn't clear if he was simply playing to the crowd, so to speak, or sincerely exploring a new facet of his design DNA. Besides, you sense that the softer, more upbeat Thakoon will always have a better chance of winning the popular vote.</p></div>"
218,spring,2009,s2009,threeasfour,"Creating newness within a super-identifiable framework is the challenge Threeasfour's Gabi, Adi, and Ange have chosen for themselves. For Spring, they more than delivered on that front. The clothes, with their curving seams, drippy layers, and floating hems, looked unmistakably theirs, but they looked fresh as well. That freshness came in the form of E8 prints (remember Spirographs? These look like Spirographs on speed) that decorated an off-the-shoulder cover-up and a shorter shift. More subtly, it was there in the form of the cotton jersey Threeasfour used to turn their avant-garde silhouettes into way, way beyond basic white tees, as well as in the cutout swimsuits that they've put on the runway before, but are now finally able to produce.</p><p>The trio took a more freewheeling approach to accessories, too; the conch-shell cross sections that cinched metallic-leather sashes and decorated the necklines of dresses were chicer by far than the crocheted snoods and sandals. The finale gown, laboriously made from hundreds of capiz-shell discs that shimmied preciously with the model's every tentative step, drew clamorous applause, but it's essentially a showpiece. It's the less obvious dresses—like an A-line trapeze in blush silk georgette with a lace inset swirling below the knees—that deserve the real praise.</p></div>"
219,spring,2009,s2009,tibi,"Amy Smilovic lived in Hong Kong and started her business there, so Sunday's Asian-inspired collection for Spring, which had a touch of the eighties thrown in for good measure, was a homecoming of sorts. Prints were the thing, as usual, showing up in flora and fauna in shades of yellow, jade, bloodred, and bright blue. A few too many harem pants took a stroll down the runway for the likes of Tibi's usual customer, but the bright, well-draped dresses in eye-catching hues will surely find a home come spring. A long and flowing red number with a fitted bodice and not too many gimmicks was a nice break from some of the more costume-y pieces, proving that even in an Asian-inspired show, mandarin collars need not be included.</p></div>"
220,spring,2009,s2009,todd-lynn,"Rocker tailoring with a touch of the goth is Todd Lynn's thing, and whatever the season, he's a guy who's never going to stray too far from that dark and sinuous path. For Spring, he whittled it to 33 looks, working some kind of eye-tricking device into almost every outfit. The first was a case in point: What looked like a shorts suit was actually an all-in-one. There followed several variations: tailcoats merged into pantsuits, and jackets and skirts that were actually dresses.</p><p>Beside this, Lynn drove himself to jigsaw rough, slubby fabric together to make skinny pants, and to work out how a series of pleats can spiral around a leg to create a flared trouser. Objectively, all that work was hard to achieve and technically accomplished. Subjectively, though? There's something about the tight, seamed, carapace shapes that screams ""hard to wear,"" and the mood seemed too gloomy for a summer season.</p></div>"
221,spring,2009,s2009,tommy-hilfiger,"Witnessing the posh scene at Tommy Hilfiger—showgoers filing into the grand and airy environs of Avery Fisher Hall after draining glasses of Champagne—it seemed almost unfathomable that this is the same designer who once packed the tent at Bryant Park to the gills because N.E.R.D. was performing. Spring is the fourth season since Hilfiger relaunched his label with a new grown-up bent, and today's collection moved even further in that direction, exhibiting a refinement in the designer's obsession with fashion iconography. Referencing the easy glamour of Angelica Huston in the eighties, the collection was clean, sporty, and elegant, with lots of billowy pale and navy silks. A multitude of trenchcoats, including one in silk gauze for evening, underlined a masculine thread. The look was finished with shiny gold headbands, mesh pumps, and tassel belts. A sartorial thrill ride? Not quite. But a drawstring jumpsuit and silk ""sweatpant"" were right on trend. And in fact, we could see one of Hilfiger's front-row girls like Diane Kruger or Charlotte Ronson putting her own spin on a perfectly lovely lemon-chiffon frock or a black cloque tunic and skirt. The mature vision might seem strange for someone formerly obsessed with youth culture, but with developments like a Fifth Avenue flagship in the works, Hilfiger seems to be settling nicely into the new space he's carved out for himself.</p></div>"
222,spring,2009,s2009,topshop-unique,"In the early eighties, there was a short-lived British girl trio called Bananarama who were chiefly notable for their terrible spiky hairdos tied up in big old rags and for dancing around in high-waisted jeans, singing such ditties as ""Really Saying Something."" Well, they were back on the runway, in spirit at least, at Topshop Unique's Spring show—what with the giant bow-tied headwraps, the stonewashed denim, and all the kitschy fifties influences that fueled that particular point in the pop history of London music and fashion.</p><p>No one of an age to consider wearing Topshop has any business knowing much about that reference, of course—since it was exactly what their mothers were getting up to, well before they were conceived. (But Peaches Geldof, daughter of Sir Bob and the late music TV presenter Paula Yates, might've clocked it—had she ever gotten off her BlackBerry. Her mom must've interviewed the Bananaramas endlessly. And Yates, too, was a great proponent of the bow-tied hair scarf at the time.)</p><p>Not that it matters too much that the Topshop team, now headed by Karen Bonser, might've turned to eighties videos and vintage copies of <em>The Face</em> to get them started. All that counts is the commercial outcome—which this time was kind of jolly and nonserious, in the way young Brit fast fashion ought to be. There was nothing profound about the love-heart prints, jumpsuits, parachute-silk batwing tops, and reruns of teddy boy and new wave tailoring, and it was a relief. Trying too hard isn't a good look for either Topshop's customers or a high-street brand, however on-it the brand might be. Result: For the first time since it debuted in 2005, this collection stopped pretending to be what it isn't, and came over as genuinely young.</p></div>"
223,spring,2009,s2009,tory-burch,"Tory Burch, homebody? OK, not exactly. But this quintessentially glamorous Manhattanite claims that she has been spending a lot of nights in lately, and what's more, she's noticed friends doing the same. Thus her increased focus on how people live, and how it affects the way they dress.</p><p>The presentation was neatly structured into three parts, each inspired by a garden—one from Italy, one from France, one from Marrakech. Marella Agnelli and Yves Saint Laurent (both of whom cultivated famous gardens in northern Italy and Morocco, respectively) also hovered as references. The clothes themselves retained their freshness while expressing a new maturity, epitomized by a Chanel-style floral jacket and a stunningly simple peach column gown. But how does Tory really make her profits grow? With fab accessories, of course: hence the Burch-ized huaraches, neon-trimmed bags, and bold necklaces.</p><p>As Burch talked, it began to sound as if we ought to start expecting a press release announcing a home line any day now. But when asked, she demurred, saying that the next extension of her brand will likely be eyewear, and that makes perfect sense. With her future looking so bright, she probably will need shades.</p></div>"
224,spring,2009,s2009,tracy-reese,"Tracy Reese once again looked to nature for inspiration, as she did for Fall, offering up a tactile collection in an Eden-worthy palette. ""It's a Spring awakening,"" she said backstage, referring to pieces like a leather jacket with crawling ivy embroidery, and a silk tulip skirt with ""petals"" that cut away to reveal a crystal appliqué. Structured peplum dresses in vibrant nectarine and jade were a pleasing contrast to more ethereal chiffon numbers, and chain-mail lariat necklaces kept it all from looking too saccharine. If there was a drawback, it was in the editing—a linen eyelet cuffed trouser looked fresh in its first incarnation, but by the third color it felt way overdone.</p></div>"
225,spring,2009,s2009,trovata,"John Whitledge, an avid surfer, set his heroine not in his home base of Newport Beach but on the Great Lakes, circa 1968. In the past, the fun and games at Trovata—capoeira demonstrations, guest rock stars, actors pretending to be Eastern European aristocrats—have sometimes overshadowed the main event. But this time it was all about the clothes: More mature and well thought out than previous seasons, Spring featured ankle-length silk shirtdresses, drop-waist frocks, and plenty of structured jackets (one standout had an Empire-pleated back). Though the look was slightly more grown-up—and, unlike last Spring, the models actually wore shoes this time—it was still characteristically kicked back. ""Overall, I want it to be simple and effortless,"" Whitledge said, showing off the models' classic white Keds. Trovata will probably always remain California-casual, but it was good to see the brand pushed forward another notch.</p></div>"
226,spring,2009,s2009,tse,"What is there to say about TSE? Clearly it's a house that knows how to pick talented designers—Hussein Chalayan and Richard Chai have passed through its revolving doors—but keeping them is another story. Tess Giberson designed for Fall, but left before the collection was presented. Spring is a collaborative effort by Dushane Noble, an in-house designer; Tom Scott, who has his own knitwear collection; and Julian Louie, a protégé of Francisco Costa, who will debut his own line next week and will work on TSE's Fall 2009 line.</p><p>Although the cashmere house is undeniably in the grips of an identity crisis, the models paraded with confidence in the light-filled showroom, with pieces from the collection suspended here and there. This created a bit of a ghostlike effect—as if to say, ""Where's the designer?""—but it also emphasized the transparency that played throughout what was, against the odds, a very accessible collection. Monet prints added color and romance to a lineup that included chunky sweaters with subtle details (like squared collars), back-buttoning cardis, light layered tops paired with knee-length pants, and a chic ""camping"" ensemble that was both utilitarian and stylish. These were more than basics, but not so much so that they would scare those customers who still associate TSE with a great cashmere sweater.</p></div>"
227,spring,2009,s2009,tuleh,"The anniversary trend continues apace. This season, Calvin celebrates 40 years in business, DKNY 20, and Tuleh 10. For an independent brand like Bryan Bradley's—he actually just sold a 49 percent stake in his company earlier this summer—surviving a decade is no small achievement. And the collection he showed in Martha Stewart's West 26th Street offices, which reprised some of his greatest hits and that never felt like a rehash, was a living demonstration of how he did it. In a word, <em>consistency</em>.</p><p>Fashion has swung back and forth a few times since Bradley began making quirky-pretty dresses for the social set, but the designer hasn't wavered. In tonight's lineup, there were pretty-pretty nipped-waist sheaths, the best in a beaded floral lace; jacquard suits with lantern-sleeve jackets and the narrowest of pencil skirts; and shirred chiffon dresses that demonstrated Bradley's zany taste in mismatched prints (devotees will recognize some of the fabrics from past collections). One of the show's highlights was a thirties siren gown in a black-and-white floral chiffon just sheer enough to reveal the cheeky polka-dot print beneath—and just the thing to woo back any of those followers, who, like that ceaseless fashion pendulum, may have temporarily gone in a different direction.</p></div>"
228,spring,2009,s2009,undercover,"Jun Takahashi says he's bored of doing runway shows, so the all-white collection he presented was staged in a gallery, with fantasy art photos on the wall and a group of dummies in the center of the space. He'd named it ""Graces,"" which turned out to be funny little half-dog, half-alien toy animals. Made by Takahashi himself in his Tokyo studio, they were perching on the shoulders of the mannequins. Quite what was going on with these ""fairy tale"" fluffy companions was hard to crack—possibly something to do with the Japanese love of the cute, combined with Takahashi's imagination as a subversive artist (his off-Harajuku workplace is full of his paintings and soft sculptures of doll-like monsters). As for the clothes, they were actually nothing conceptually freaky: layered sportswear, coats, and virginally romantic dresses with a lot of fine-thread fringing in the mix. The problem is that however you look at them, clothes on dummies don't have the animated appeal of clothes on a girl. Takahashi has every right to want to invent new ways of presenting (and it's a sensible way of thinking for cash-strapped young designers), but this season, it sold his clothes short.</p></div>"
229,spring,2009,s2009,united-bamboo,"Before their show, Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki did some spring cleaning, starting with a decision to present their menswear separately to make a bit of room for ""optimism""— the pair's key word this season. Sweeping away their sometimes over-literal architectural references and what Pham describes as a tendency to ""fuss over very complex pattern-making,"" they let in the light, allowing themselves to play with sunny pastels, zippy brights, and looser silhouettes.</p><p>James Iha provided an upbeat custom soundtrack that complemented a collection with two threads running through it: a soft preppiness and an origamilike construction. These two seemingly incongruous themes balanced harmoniously. Among the user-friendly twisted classics on the runway were a powdery-blue and white mattress-ticking dress; a roomy, hoodless parka; and a navy blue shorts suit that actually made the concept look like a viable wardrobe option. Pham said that the duo was ""having a bit more fun"" with this collection—and the audience was, too.</p></div>"
230,spring,2009,s2009,valentino,"A few days ago, a Valentino executive was quoted in the Italian press as saying it would be ""inelegant"" to comment on the rumor that Alessandra Facchinetti is on her way out. Never a truer word has been spoken, especially as the announcement that she had been handpicked (by the current owners, from a large field) to succeed the retiring Maestro was released on September 5, 2007. That is, not even 13 months before Facchinetti had to put her third collection for the house on the Paris runway. Yet another case, then, of the increasing speed of the revolving-door syndrome that is luring in and spitting out so many tender young talents at old, established brands under new ownership.</p><p>So watching Facchinetti's show was a weird experience for those who had been tracking signs of her sensitivity to aspects of the house canon—in particular, her gentle touch with chiffon and ruffles, modernized by a refined taste for no-color colors. It was always going to take time to do a good renovation job on Valentino's daywear—frozen as it is in the time of the ladies who lunched—and, sure enough, Facchinetti's answers weren't quite there yet. For Spring, they came in the form of soft, drapey silk polka-dot dresses, and shorts suits with raised, coiled, jeweled embroidery settled in necklines or as epaulets. The embellishment was over-heavy, but you could see what the designer was getting at in the way of softening and relaxing a look that formerly only sat well with an over-lacquered hairdo. Certainly, much more needs to be done to resolve that issue in this house, and Facchinetti's device of a curved-up, sporty side slit (the sort you see on running shorts) didn't help matters much.</p><p>Still, to give her credit where it's due, Facchinetti's subtle, pale lemon and violet nudes later on did evoke the elusive quality of femininity that is expected of this label. And when it came to the big test—the red draped georgette evening dress—hers was unarguably lovely: a one-shouldered affair, made to look modern with the addition of flat jeweled slippers. The collection might have benefited from a follow-through on the fuzzily frothy blouses that could have been spot-on as a great selling item for Spring. In the end, though, a poignant sense of might-have-been hung in the air as Facchinetti took her bow. Whatever transpires next, the task of continuing this brand's integrity is surely not going to get any easier.</p></div>"
231,spring,2009,s2009,vena-cava,"""Egyptomania"" is the key to deciphering Vena Cava's latest effort. Lisa Mayock and Sophie Buhai looked to the King Tut craze that enthralled America during the mummy's world tour in the mid-seventies, resurrecting that decade's sportswear silhouettes, but punctuated them with hieroglyphs and zodiac symbols. The CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists demonstrated their superior draping skills once again with several nipped-waist chiffon gowns, while the addition of more structured pieces—a sleeveless power suit with a flawless fit, to give one good example—proved the duo has range. There were shoes, too, taken from their new collaboration with Via Spiga. But it wasn't all about making a serious impression: An allover print on an evening gown turned out to be snippets from an Egyptian glossary of mythology. Kitschy, sure, but it's just the kind of irreverent detail we've come to expect (and love) from these two.</p></div>"
232,spring,2009,s2009,vera-wang,"Vera Wang's Spring collection was as artsy as ever, but, inspired by the proto-pop French artist Niki de Saint Phalle, the designer expanded on the soft-focus romance she's known for to embrace a gutsier kind of chic. From across the room you'd still peg each piece in the collection as signature Vera, but in addition to the familiar sheer gazar over-slips and three-dimensional dresses there were now narrow ""basketball"" tanks, skinny cigarette pants and leggings, and pencil skirts. In counterpoint to the hand-painted duchesse satin frocks and skirts, Wang showed graphic prints—a charcoal and white color-blocked tank dress stood out for its sharp simplicity. Joining her crystalline necklines and necklaces were panels of colorful mosaic-cut sequins cascading down the front of a dress, or wrapping the waist of a skirt that echoed the silvery gray sculpture at the back of the runway.</p><p>Favoring a shorter silhouette for both day and evening, Wang limited herself to two gowns—one in gray and orange layers of silk organza, the other a short beaded dress with an ankle-skimming sheer veil. All in all, there was newness here (Janis Savitt-designed cameo jewelry included), but still plenty that should please the designer's loyalists, who like their Vera just the way it is, thank you very much.</p></div>"
233,spring,2009,s2009,vera-wang-lavender-label,"Does Vera Wang secretly yearn to run away and join a gang? For her Lavender Label collection, the designer offered up a sophisticated take on street urchin style. This translated into some serious layering of organza slips and logo tees, shorter hemlines, and bold details like studs and oversize grommets, the latter used to strong effect in a neat take on the eyelet blouse. Accessories were similarly tough, from an extra-wide square-link belt to a tangled chain pendant necklace. Wang carried over silhouettes from seasons past, including Peter Pan collars, prim skirts, and easy silk tank dresses, but in an updated neutral palette of beige, black, and white. Now in its fourth season, Vera Wang Lavender Label has steadily grown into an attention-worthy entry in an otherwise crowded contemporary market.</p></div>"
234,spring,2009,s2009,veronique-branquinho,"Chalk it up to her late time slot or the inconvenient location, but Veronique Branquinho has fallen off the radar for a lot of big editors and retailers. The fact that she's no longer the new kid on the block probably plays into it, too: The cool hunters have chewed up and spit out a couple of generations of ""next big things"" since she first hit the scene in 1998.</p><p>But those who've stuck around noticed a positive development this evening. Last season, a heavy, awkward silhouette sometimes got the best of her; here, she lightened things up considerably, starting with the landscape prints—mountain, desert, ocean—that decorated easy shifts. The suits with which she made her name were back to their simple-chic proportions, too. Instead of tricking out the shoulders, she spliced strips of futuristic-looking iridescent material into the jackets and trousers. But the dominant look here was a loose, oversize vest, worn as a jacket over shorts, that negotiated the delicate balance between pulled-together and edgy. It just might draw some eyes back her way.</p></div>"
235,spring,2009,s2009,versace,"In a season when many designers have been hedging their bets with practical daywear, Donatella Versace took it short, young, and just a little sweet—for her, that is. The cute part was a 3-D heart shape formed by an open zipper; it nestled in the neckline of the first dress and turned up strategically placed in other spots throughout the show. Otherwise, though, the collection was for the most part graphic and above the knee, with one or two examples of the faceted, angular cutting that's been picking up since Francisco Costa showed it at Calvin Klein.</p><p>If it wasn't particularly themed as a show, it was no particular letdown either. What came through more than anything was the palpable quality of these clothes—the days of tacky Versace are firmly behind Donatella. Still, the most memorable impression was left by the pretty, summery prints of starfish, shells, and girl faces, hand-drawn and painted by Julie Verhoeven.</p></div>"
236,spring,2009,s2009,victoria-beckham,"The woman formerly known as Posh Spice has launched a dress collection, and, believe it or not, it's one of the hottest things going in New York this week. It should come as no surprise that Victoria Beckham is an entrepreneur to be taken seriously; she's already launched dVb denim and sunglasses, and her fragrance, which was previously unavailable here, is soon headed to the States. But her sheaths and shift dresses, which we're told several major retailers are vying to offer exclusively, will sell not on the power of her name but on the sophistication of their cut and fit.</p><p>Every one of them could've been pulled from Beckham's own closet. The silhouette is beyond body-conscious, ultra-fitted from shoulder line to below the knee, with special seams along the derriere and torso to ensure against flat rear ends and busts, respectively. And each comes with woman-friendly details like a rose-gold back zipper (""so you don't have to dive into it and mess your hair and makeup"") and a removable grosgrain ribbon lining the waist (""for posture""). If the collection owes a debt to anyone, it's Roland Mouret, whose Galaxy dress gave curves to even the most skeletal of celebrities, or maybe Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But Beckham denies the inspiration. ""This has been a lifetime in the making,"" she said, adding that she's been wearing the best designers in the world for about as long. And she's not interested in making an It dress. ""I don't want to make dresses that will date. I've always been about clever buying."" The dresses will range from $1,500 to $3,600.</p></div>"
237,spring,2009,s2009,viktor-rolf,"If last season's Viktor &amp; Rolf runway show was a rejection of the ever-quickening pace of fashion, the duo's new Web show, which Style.com exclusively previewed in advance of its October 2 debut on the label's Web site, was a proposal for an alternative. No invitations, no seating charts, no traffic jams, no endless wait. Not that creating the ten-minute video saved them much money: It took two-and-a-half days to shoot Shalom Harlow and a team of 57 to insert her along with her clones along the virtual runway. At the finale, the ""models"" stood in an array clapping before dissolving into so many pixels and evaporating into the digital ether.</p><p>Pixelation gave Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren a starting point for the collection, which, at just 21 looks, felt a bit slim. On the obvious side was a white T-shirt with a pixelated dragon on it; more abstract and fabulous were the trio of Swarovski crystal-banded dresses accented with candy-striped rills of organza. (Speaking of man hours, those three frocks took four weeks each to hand-make.) Somewhere in the middle of the literal-to-conceptual spectrum were supersized versions of those organza rills on a dramatic cocktail dress, and various experiments in volume (a solid black coat and a dress in spicy shades of yellow, orange, and red that expanded and contracted in droopy tiers down the body). Many looks were shown with futuristic black-and-white tights.</p><p>So does the Web show have legs? In our new economy, it's a proposition worth pursuing, but for this collection, the cool concept overshadowed the too-few clothes.</p></div>"
238,spring,2009,s2009,vivienne-tam,"Two threads ran through Vivienne Tam's Spring collection Tuesday night: peonies and an homage to the late Yves Saint Laurent. The YSL element could be seen in the tailored suiting options; the peonies could be seen everywhere. ""Every woman loves peonies,"" Tam declared before her show, and she wrote her love letter in prints, appliqués, and cutouts evoking the bloom's lush beauty. The tailoring was beside the point (it's just not Tam's thing), and the less said about her pinstripe version of Le Smoking, the better. The peonies were much more successful. Flowy maxi dresses in a petal print looked light, cool, and full of life; a snazzy, pleated chiffon silk sheath with a single oversize blossom on it had a graphic appeal. Tam's protracted show had its share of blunders, and these missteps weighed down a collection that had several lovely moments.</p></div>"
239,spring,2009,s2009,vivienne-westwood,"The Earls Court venue was vast, the faithful were out in force (looking a little more ragged each year), and of course there was an hour's wait. But aside from those echoes of Westwood spectacles past, Queen Viv's show for her secondary Red Label line was actually an up-to-date collection of appealing outfits with just enough of her legendary iconoclasm and body-consciousness to give the clothes some kick. The story could have been ""The Berber and the Brit."" There was a flavor of North Africa in the hooded dresses, the hats, the stripes, the prints, and the long white shirt worn with a waistcoat over dropped-crotch pants. But the plaid suit with the flared peplum, the severely tailored jackets with draped or origami-ed lapels, and the tea dresses with fabric draped around the hips and knotted in front were vintage Anglomania. The chic of a navy halter sheath or a black silk shirtdress almost compensated for the metallics, which just looked cheap.</p></div>"
240,spring,2009,s2009,vpl,"""Velocity"" was the title of Victoria Bartlett's show—and the collection did indeed show that she's speeding in the right direction. The season's theme was aviation, but Bartlett kept it from getting overwhelming. There were lots of cleverly worked airplane and pilot details, from nylon straps to rolled, ballooning sleeves to cords that ran through knits and tees. A black parachute jumpsuit was one of the best examples of the genre we've seen this season (which is saying a lot). Save for a pop of hot pink that looked terrific on Bartlett's new swimwear, the palette was desaturated. The collection won't appeal to everyone—actually, the Sopwith Camel-esque jodhpur leggings probably won't appeal to anyone—but the Bartlett brand is flying higher than ever.</p></div>"
241,spring,2009,s2009,william-rast,"An impressive slice of the industry showed up for Justin Timberlake and his partner Trace Ayala's runway debut. ""We're just here to introduce ourselves,"" said Timberlake modestly, standing backstage with Ayala. Well, New York, meet the William Rast girl. She's tough and tomboyish, but also dangerous and sexy. She's from the country, but now cosmopolitan enough to wear a fringed cowboy bootie and plaid shirt with a mix of integrity and irony. The hard-edged look was mainly comprised of biker jackets and vests in denim, soft leather, and army fatigue cotton, trimmed with brass pyramid studs or fringe and worn with lean distressed jeans. Having teamed up with Johan and Marcella Lindeberg as creative directors of the label, Ayala and Timberlake seem serious about having a go at fashion and building what Timberlake referred to as ""a true American brand."" Unlike many celebrity-associated lines we've seen pass through our fair city, these are clothes that girls would wear—the best, and seemingly most substantial in terms of design quotient, being the jackets. Only time will tell, but Timberlake may be adding a new hyphen to his title.</p></div>"
242,spring,2009,s2009,wunderkind,"Wolfgang Joop is Paris' resident eccentric. He brought the zany once again for Spring, following up last season's space romp with a collection that was more grown-up but barely less whimsical. He said his frame of reference was the sculptor/architect Isamu Noguchi and pre- and postwar Japan. That explained the olive-drab, military-inspired cargo jackets and pants that he paired with multicolored rose-print blouses, and, somewhat more tangentially, a butterfly superimposed on a checked chiffon that he used for floaty, away-from-the-body dresses. The line connecting those Eastern references and, say, his lace-doily numbers was a bit fuzzier; for quirkiness, he hit the jackpot with a white coat in the frilly stuff. If you didn't ask yourself too many questions about the viability of Joop's creations—multicolor polka-dot suit, anyone?—this stream-of-consciousness collection was an amusing ride.</p></div>"
243,spring,2009,s2009,y-3,"Considering that Y-3 is the same label that has, at various turns, brought us such big-budget spectacles as a three-story-high, logoed bank vault; an artificial thunderstorm; and a 230-foot wall of ice; today's minimal presentation couldn't possibly have been the result of something as banal as the failing economy. And it wasn't. The stark look of unfinished gray planks, embellished only by an installation of fluorescent tube lights (is it just us, or is New York having a Dan Flavin moment?), was entirely intentional. The press notes offered the cryptic seasonal principle of ""a reflection on the tradition of sport,"" loosely connecting the new minimalism to Adidas' 60th anniversary and the simplicity of the triple stripe.</p><p>Following suit, the clothes were somewhat underwhelming, with lots of black sporty separates edged in various places with a strip of triple stripe. These are the things that will presumably stock the shelves of Y-3's soon-to-be two New York stores. (A second one opens in Soho this Tuesday.) The Yohji direction was evident in some places: crinkled-mesh T-shirt dresses, some layered over striped or logoed tees; patch-pocketed dirndl skirts worn with bright tops; and the interesting idea of sliced shoulders and hanging sleeves. The show ended with a pair of brides, sneakers on and veils held in place by oversize baseball caps, mixing French tradition with American insanity. We'll call the look <em>La Mariée</em> Runaway.</p></div>"
244,spring,2009,s2009,yigal-azrouel,"Yigal Azrouël, who recently set up shop in Water Mill, New York, knows how to hang ten—both on a surfboard and, increasingly, on the runway. Over the past few seasons the charmingly laid-back Azrouël has focused on the ""lived-in"" look. This, it turns out, has nothing to do with vintage and everything to do with the comfort that comes from, say, a well-broken-in pair of jeans or a leather softened through a special process of washing and finishing.</p><p>Azrouël is at his most effective when his clothes look like they could have been nicked from the models' own closets, and these were in the majority this season. The weathered batik pieces effectively introduced a print element, and there were great pants—from a seamed paperweight leather and cotton style to shrunken and tapered denim—to pair with a number of strong jackets. Some of Azrouël's more ambitious experiments in draping, especially for evening (as well as a not-quite-Rudi Gernreich swimsuit ensemble), fell a bit flat. The real flow didn't come from the cascades and ruffles, but from the unpretentious ease of his singular brand of wash-and-wear.</p></div>"
245,spring,2009,s2009,yohji-yamamoto,"A Yohji show these days can stop you in your tracks. Not so much because he shocks you—he's not an out-with-the-old, in-with-the-new kind of guy—but because of his wistful score and the models' stately pace. You could call them old-fashioned, but they encourage the eye to relax, which isn't so easy after 20-something days of nonstop fashion. Those who did settle into the mood were well rewarded by a collection that didn't necessarily break ground, but was lovely in a quiet, almost meditative way.</p><p>The show was essentially divided into two sections. First came the black suits, some shown with arabesques of white topstitching, all cut with an eye for the graceful asymmetries that Yamamoto is famous for. Jackets with uneven lapels and tails, or misbuttoned to create a ruffle undulation on one side, were worn above narrow pants or long, full skirts. The ivory dresses that came next followed the same principle: They were pieced together from irregularly shaped swatches of white and cream fabrics and fell slightly away from the body. The bride, typically the last look, padded out in a grand picture hat and a big hoop skirt. This time she was followed by four more models, all—like the girls who preceded them—wearing sunglasses, and each in a different variation of a soft navy coat. On a day when the Dow plummeted 777 points, the Zen-chant repetition had a calming effect that even a crowd perpetually chasing the next new thing could appreciate.</p></div>"
246,spring,2009,s2009,zac-posen,"Zac Posen's show is always a scene. Tonight, he had Schnabel <em>père et fille</em> in one corner, Claire Danes and Jada Pinkett Smith in another, and Venus Williams and Serena Williams smack-dab in the middle—everywhere you looked there were flashbulbs popping. In seasons past, Posen has displayed a deft hand for tailoring, but that wasn't his focus here. Instead, there were mostly dresses with a few minis and suede biker jackets thrown in aimed at that other kind of 9-to-5er: the type who makes a business of party-hopping.</p><p>The viability of some of the frocks was dubious at best. Was that padding underneath the first Perspex-plated dress, or had Raquel Zimmermann suddenly put on a few extra inches around the hips? And how, exactly, is a girl supposed to sit down wearing all of that hard plastic and metal on her backside? But underneath the extensions, frosted lipstick, and shoulder-duster earrings were some leopard-print dresses that have a red carpet in their future.</p></div>"
247,spring,2009,s2009,zero-maria-cornejo,"As milestones are apt to do, Maria Cornejo's tenth anniversary put the designer in a reflective state of mind. She summed up today's show as ""all the things I believe in."" On the macro level, Cornejo's design ethos—which, it should be noted, is wholly her own—is about duality: hard versus soft, masculine versus feminine, and chaos versus control. It played out here, for instance, in the tension of hard-edged geometric shapes relating to the body's curves; a grouping that featured a riot of layered patterns and textures reined into cohesion; and even in the few new menswear looks, made androgynous enough to be worn by Cornejo's female clientele. Speaking of that dedicated fan club, the collection visited all of Cornejo's signatures that keep them coming back every season to build their wardrobe. In addition to their cocoon jackets and smartly draped silk dresses, they may consider adding the new silhouette of a lean knit dress, the many perforated leathers, or a black washed silk jumpsuit worn under a bone hooded coat that brought a chic and simple breath of fresh air to a shape we've seen so much this week.</p></div>"
248,spring,2009,s2009,3-1-phillip-lim,"The elaborate blond wood Moorish arches at the mouth of the runway were an obvious clue that Phillip Lim was about to hitch a ride onto a Spanish caravan for Spring. Far from rehashing flamenco skirts, the designer extracted a few choice motifs from his Andalusian inspiration. Foremost was the ruffle, which fluttered on the back flaps of chiffon trenchcoats and wobbled in tightly mashed form atop the bright Christian Louboutin pumps, but most often it came slightly flattened and unevenly tiered on the hems of garçon jackets and knit dresses. There was also a flash of mantilla fringe, and dresses and coats with the geometric echo of those mosques-turned-cathedrals.</p><p>When it comes to his ever-growing business, however, Lim's focus goes beyond Iberia to the global front. And it's that international market's demand for more fashion (""they want the crazy,"" he said, a few days before the show) that encouraged him to be in experimental mode. But Lim's version of Direction for the Masses—heightened by skewed-bun hairdos and kooky double-loop belts in which many saw strains of Viktor &amp; Rolf—was a bit overdone. There are undeniably great pieces in this collection, but Lim occupies a strange orbit in the fashion universe as the contemporary designer who garners attention equal to his higher-priced counterparts. Now that everyone's listening, sending a cohesive message of brand identity may be the next step.</p></div>"
1,fall,2009,f2009,a-f-vandevorst,"Filip Arickx and An Vandevorst are on their own trip. For Fall, they dreamed up a nomad who's ""at home wherever she goes."" They explained: She wears clothes with interesting new volumes constructed by integrating the squares, triangles, and circles of multiculti folkloric patterns into Western silhouettes.</p><p>On the more obvious side, this concept resulted in a sleeping-bag coat in wool felt quilted up the back with geometric shapes; and silk dresses and rabbit-fur vests checkerboarded or chevroned in complementary shades of green, gray, and brown. On the subtler side, it produced trenches with built-out shoulders and a floor-length dress with eye-grabbing diamond-shaped insets on the sides. Tangentially, there were dolman-sleeved cotton shirts in horse-blanket stripes (one in loden green and black, the other ivory and black) worn with jodhpurs. But, unsurprisingly, this wasn't equestrian like you've seen it on other runways: Note the platform boots that looked like horse hooves. Still, footwear aside, this collection contained plenty of real-world clothes, not always a given at an A.F. Vandevorst show, and Filip and An should be taking plenty of girls along for the ride this season.</p></div>"
2,fall,2009,f2009,abaete,"Laura Poretzky was raised in several countries, but she is French-born and fluent in her mother tongue, so her choice of postrevolutionary France as a stylistic jumping-off point could be considered something of a homecoming. In keeping with her <em>Les Incroyables</em> theme, there were jodhpurs, a few ruffles, and a dash of aristocratic embellishments (some—like the chain-laden booties for Payless—less successful than others). A black knit jersey dress with short satin cap sleeves looked chic with a belt, and a breezier one in a jacquard print made up for some of the femininity that was missing throughout. All in all, it was an assured collection, with plenty to add to the polished girl's mix.</p></div>"
3,fall,2009,f2009,acne-studios,"Jonny Johansson of Acne, the Swedish fashion phenomenon, isn't one of those guys who goes about his business like a big shot. ""I'm from reindeer country,"" he likes to tell people. But he's infiltrated the international denim, T-shirt, and well-priced separates markets with such indie integrity that all kinds of cool people want to be associated with the brand. Like, for starters, Alber Elbaz, who buddied up to the Swede to make Lanvin's hit jeans collection. It was a big stride, nonetheless, for Johansson to pitch up in London and show his line outside Stockholm for the first time. In typical fashion, he lured the curious to the Sir John Soane's Museum, an obscure and marvelous cabinet of ancient and architectural artifacts that many hometowners have never heard of.</p><p>What Johansson presented was a far cry from jeanswear basics. ""It started when I was sitting in the Café de Flore in Paris and thinking what to do,"" he said. ""I looked over, saw an old guy, maybe in his seventies, hanging out, and his hands were covered in rings. So I started drawing."" That image, linked with an inspiration about the kind of girls who populate the Berlin art scene, gave rise to a collection that ran from well-cut tailoring (overcoats and seventies high-waisted pantsuits) to plastic jeans to chunky gold and diamond jewelry made in collaboration with the venerated German artist-goldsmith Michael Zobel. Huge cuffs, rings big enough to occupy two fingers, and saucer or box-shaped pins—all set with rough diamonds, Tahitian pearls, emeralds, seashells, or rough-hewn slabs of semiprecious stones—drew the most attention, and surprise. Delving into precious jewelry might seem reckless in a stalled economy, but Johansson promises he's only following the instincts that have driven him to success since he started in 1993. Acne, after all, is an acronym for Ambition to Create Novel Expressions. He and his team don't play by conventional rules. And as he pointed out, the much-trusted jeans and T-shirts are constantly available online, anyway.</p></div>"
4,fall,2009,f2009,adam-lippes,"""This is the center of the American design industry,"" Adam Lippes replied when asked why he'd decided to bring his latest show to the Bryant Park tents now, in this season of discontent. ""It felt like the right time to be here.""</p><p>Lippes also thought the time was right for bright, upbeat shots of primary color—and he didn't hold back. Inspired by an exhibit of Japanese photography at Boston's Peabody Museum, he interpreted images of samurai warriors and Mount Fuji into sunny, wearable separates (many bedecked with layers of sequins) for a fun-loving girl.</p><p>ADAM does a brisk business in outerwear, and the oversize felted wool blazers and realistic faux-fur jackets were just the sort of attractively priced basics that recession-weary shoppers could be convinced to shell out for come autumn. With the recent opening of a second boutique, this one in his native Buffalo, N.Y., Lippes appears poised to become a torchbearer for a new generation in American sportswear.</p></div>"
5,fall,2009,f2009,akris,"Akris' profile is on the upswing lately, thanks to Angelina Jolie, who wore a minimal white suit from the Swiss label during the press junket for <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>. Designer Albert Kriemler, an avowed architecture buff, found inspiration for Fall in a pavilion in China's Jinhua Architecture Park designed by Mexico's Tatiana Bilbao. The result was a trapezoidal leitmotif that materialized as the geometric embroidery on the tulle sleeves of a fitted wool dress, on the geometric quilting of a bomber jacket, and on a floor-length number with a front constructed of interconnected trapezoids (one editor cracked that it looked like tile swatches).</p><p>If there was a heavy-handedness to such pieces, there were others that gave glimpses of the sort of understatement that makes the likes of Jolie a fan. Take a deep bordeaux long-line vest in double wool crepe with a slightly padded shoulder and matching pants; a black-purple cashmere leather-belted coat; or a crackly glazed-wool tailored top worn with a matching skirt. Chic and wearable, they proved again that Kriemler is at his best when he thinks simple.</p></div>"
6,fall,2009,f2009,alberta-ferretti,"It's increasingly difficult, and ultimately pointless, to try to parse an Alberta Ferretti runway show as if it were a ""collection"" with a theme. Instead, it is what it is: an assortment of this and that, with sporadic touches of trend and a bit of something for everyone. For Fall, that meant a 15-minute parade that included magenta, aqua, and ocher color-blocking in chiffon and tailoring; eighties black leather; a glitter-shoulder rock-chick body-con dress; Art Deco flapperwear; sober gray wool pieces; and metallic brocade Edwardiana party frocks.</p><p>That said, the content never veered too far off the known Ferretti path. She showed her staples: feminine coats, pretty chiffon (now cut into billowy blouses—a less expensive addition to her signature line of dresses), and bugle-beaded eveningwear (the best piece was a silvery twenties number on Jourdan Dunn). In Ferretti's stores, with the collection merchandised into logical groupings and with her inarguable knowledge of what women need from clothes for a broad spectrum of events and eventualities, her ""stories"" will undoubtedly all hang together in a perfectly orchestrated whole. Stringing them along back-to-back in a linear fashion, however, doesn't make a narrative.</p></div>"
7,fall,2009,f2009,albino,"Albino D'Amato's dual obsessions, geometric construction and fluid draping, put this 5-year-old label firmly in step with the onward march of fashion. His cocoon coats came twisted and knotted at the back below the knee, a leitmotif on more than a few runways lately; and there were echoes of some of the sculptural necklines seen at Jil Sander in his silk sack dresses.</p><p>But is there anything to set D'Amato apart and above other designers operating just below the radar of the international editors and retailers who've descended on Milan this week? If anything, it's his sense of color. In a season when established talents have relied too much on the safety of black, D'Amato paired bronze satin with amethyst and sapphire and sent out one of the prettiest bottle greens. His sky blue blouse and absinthe wrap skirt signal brighter days ahead—if not for the world at large, at least for him.</p></div>"
8,fall,2009,f2009,alessandro-dell-acqua,"If there's one item of desire to take away from the Fall collections in Milan, it might turn out to be something as low-key as a loose, slouchy, very luxurious mushroom suede coat. When all the noise and the pointy shoulders and the flogged-to-tedium eighties referencing is forgotten, pieces like the one Alessandro Dell'Aqua slipped onto the runway at the beginning of his show might prove to be the cool survivor.</p><p>While watching a Dell'Acqua show, a useful observation like that often pops up, even if there is no overarching moment to scribble down. He's good at nailing the single item, even if in truth most of his show is dutifully in step with the general Milanese way of doing things. Inevitably, then, Dell'Acqua was off to the disco with everyone else in town this season, except he'd had a vision of Joan of Arc on his way there—as if she were photographed by Bill King in the seventies. If that almost puts him in the laugh-out-loud category of fashion inspiration, the chain-mail knitwear tunics, fur, and feather and sequins he put together were no less pointless than some of his peers' notions for nightlife. And apart from his covetable coats, Dell'Acqua also did an original needle-heeled shoe: an assembly of crocodile, suede straps, and chain mail that would also be worthy of seeing the light of day next fall.</p></div>"
9,fall,2009,f2009,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen may be the last designer standing who is brave or foolhardy enough to present a collection that is an unadulterated piece of hard and ballsy showmanship. The heated arguments that broke out afterward were testament to that. There were those who found his picture of women with sex-doll lips and sometimes painfully theatrical costumes ugly and misogynistic. Others—mainly young spectators who haven't been thrilled by the season's many sensible pitches to middle-aged working women—were energized by the sheer spectacle, as well as the couture-level drama in the execution of the clothes.</p><p>It was certainly meant as a last-stand fin de siècle blast against the predicament in which fashion, and possibly consumerism as a whole, finds itself. The set was a scrap heap of debris from the stages of McQueen's own past shows, surrounded by a shattered glass runway. The clothes were, for the most part, high-drama satires of twentieth-century landmark fashion: parodies of Christian Dior houndstooth New Look and Chanel tweed suits, moving through harsh orange and black harlequinade looks to revisited showstoppers from McQueen's own archive.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>The romantic side of McQueen's character, which rises intermittently in deliriously beautiful shows like his recent tribute to the Victorian empire, was emphatically in abeyance. This is a designer who has drawn so much poetry out of the past, yet this time his backward look appeared to be in something like anger, defiance, or possibly gallows humor. Some of the pieces, like a couple of swag-sided coats, seemed to be made of trash bags, accessorized with aluminum cans wrapped in plastic as headgear.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vkwd7v""></div></div><p>Nevertheless, however frustrated McQueen may be by the state of commercial fashion, he was not really in absurdist rip-it-up mode. Whatever else is gnawing him, this is a man who will never compromise on construction and craftsmanship. This season, he'd noticeably forgone his typical carapace corsetry, making for slightly easier shapes, like boxy jackets, airy gazar dresses, and a fringed dogtooth sheath. For McQueen's faithful, there were also fiercely tailored coats, nipped in the waist and picking up on biker quilted leather and big-shouldered silhouettes. Evening-wise—sans the drag-queen makeup—there was a slim, black paillette homage-to-YSL wrapover dress with a red-lined hood that would stand up as elegant in any company.</p><p>Ultimately, for all the feathered and sculpted showpieces that must have taken hundreds of seamstress-hours to perfect, this was a McQueen collection that didn't push fashion anywhere new. Yet that seemed to be exactly one of the things he was pointing to: the state of a collapsed economy that doesn't know how to move forward.</p></div>"
10,fall,2009,f2009,alexander-wang,"Following a few seasons at West Chelsea's Eyebeam Studio, Alexander Wang moved his show to Roseland Ballroom, a venue that's witnessed generations of cool kids, loud music, and smoky late nights. In other words: a hand-in-glove perfect fit for Wang's cool clothes, loud crowd, and smoking after-parties. Walking into the big ballroom—as packs of photographers flashed It chicks Jen Brill and Sophia Hesketh, and even some bona fide celebrities (Sarah Jessica Parker and Zoe Kravitz)—it felt like…2008.</p><p>Well, 2009 has been a surprisingly good year so far for Wang, who is, of course, the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund's latest big winner (and who, intriguingly, had British retail tycoon Sir Philip Green in his audience today). ""We're evolving,"" he said a couple days before the show, in his studio. ""We're asking: What does growing up mean for our girl?"" His answer included buzzwords like <em>tailoring</em> and <em>luxury</em>, but tailoring and luxury laced with a savage thread. We saw jackets with sleeves edged in cubed metal rivets, leathers fringed with foxtails, and a trench with beastly toscana sleeves and croc flaps. There was coordination to the hilt, with matching shoes, belts, and bags (he now has 40 styles of the latter, up from last season's five). Still, even with the matchy-matchy, the polish, and the new maturity, his models stomped down the runway with their accustomed—almost dangerous—sexiness.</p><p>There were shades of Montana and Mugler in that wild power babe. But Wang's vision is a singular one, and it clearly speaks to twentysomethings. If you think the pomp of a runway show like this one seems out of place in an era when others are scaling back, Wang actually does have his feet planted on terra firma: His great clothes and accessories are priced to sell. And this year? No after-party.</p></div>"
11,fall,2009,f2009,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Things were a bit off-kilter at Alexandre Herchcovitch's show today, and that was exactly the way they were supposed to be. The Brazilian designer said that he took inspiration from ""big cities that have grown up in chaos, like my city—São Paulo—and Berlin."" As architectural styles are varied in these metropolises, Herchcovitch mixed multiple silhouettes in a single piece of clothing. The theme continued through to the accessories: Models carried ""pieces of the city"" in their hands in the form of stone-shaped minaudières.</p><p>The collection is much more complicated to describe than it was to take in; despite all the bells and whistles, it was designed with a light hand. Although the spangled and half-ruffled cerise-print dresses that opened the show looked like they should be delivered for spring instead of fall, they were so pretty that Herchcovitch's customer probably won't mind. The designer did offer some similarly multi-textured coats; but with ruffled chiffon insets at the back, warmth probably isn't their primary function. ""They move a little bit weird,"" he said approvingly of a charming series of sequin-striped jerseys. It's that not-quite-right quality that defines Herchcovitch's work and his appeal to big-city girls who understand that sometimes bad means good.</p></div>"
12,fall,2009,f2009,altuzarra,"""I didn't want the collection to be cold or distant,"" said Joseph Altuzarra of his 15-plus-piece debut presentation. No chance of that. His are the kind of of-the-moment, body-conscious clothes made for raising, ahem, emotions in hot-blooded males. With the forties and eighties as reference points, Altuzarra turned out ruched dresses in white stretch matte jersey with slightly padded shoulders; camel-colored pantsuits with fitted jackets and razor-slim pants; and one-shoulder silver-blue silk lamé and stretch georgette cocktail dresses worn with above-the-knee black suede boots. But the Givenchy and Proenza Schouler alum isn't a one-note boy wonder. Lose the superfluous fur fringe on the sharp cashmere-wool cream coat that opened the show or the jacket that followed, and the collection would be less about landing a man than landing that big job. It can't be easy launching a business at a time like this, but Altuzarra's polished technique means he's an up-and-comer to take seriously.</p></div>"
13,fall,2009,f2009,andreas-kronthaler-for-vivienne-westwood,"After appearing with Dame Viv and her husband, Andreas Kronthaler, in the Vivienne Westwood Spring advertising campaign, Pamela Anderson walked the runway at today's Fall show. Her first time out, Pammy's arms were bound behind her back. She's not exactly your typical fashion muse, and her getup wasn't exactly the kind of thing you expect to see on the catwalk—but remember who we're talking about here. Westwood also saw fit to send out three-meter lengths of raw-cut fabric tossed about the shoulders and call them cloaks; then there were the dresses with crinolines permanently kicked up, the hems inching past the models' ears as if they had found themselves in the middle of a hurricane.</p><p>Speaking of inclement weather, Westwood dubbed her collection ""+5°,"" as in the five degrees the earth's average temperatures are calculated to rise as CO2 levels skyrocket. The symbol appeared on T-shirts, and the message gave her a good excuse to extend the do-it-yourself/consume-less idea she put forth last season, this time via borrowed-from-your man's-closet big jackets. Amid Anderson's shenanigans and the political propaganda there were one or two moments that recalled Westwood's iconoclastic heyday: a Lurex-shot Edwardian jacket worn with baggy camo-print cargos for one, and a black dévoré velvet, one-shoulder, asymmetrically wrapped dress for another. But it would've required a few more for this collection to be taken seriously.</p></div>"
14,fall,2009,f2009,andrew-gn,"Andrew Gn traded in the lush, tropical colors of his Spring show for a more subdued Fall lineup of black, white, and herringbone tweed, with shots of teal, bronze, and bottle green. Last season's gold-bullion embroidery and gobstopper-size crystal and gem embellishments have been downsized, too—replaced by less flashy surface detailing: trims of patent leather, snake, or (in his made-to-measure Atelier line) mock croc. These appeared on the neckline of a red cocktail dress, at the waistband of cropped and tapered pants, at the edges of geometric cutouts on silk blouses, and on the toggle closures of slim-line coats.</p><p>If some of Gn's more tony ladies are forced by his new restraint to look elsewhere for their trifles, his daywear's dark and moody vibe is likely to win him some hip new customers. It will probably prove a savvy move to have dialed down the before-dark glitz in a collection he dubbed ""utility couture.""</p><p>Evening was another story, however. His floor-length columns came with jewels nestled into their necklines or perched on one shoulder. The best was a chiffon number with hand-stitched organza bell sleeves and iridescent crystal embroidery inspired by thirties Cartier jewelry. Gn knows that the only utility in a gown is its ability to turn heads.</p></div>"
15,fall,2009,f2009,ann-demeulemeester,"Last season Ann Demeulemeester lightened up, showing draped and wrapped togas in brilliant shades of orange. Today she returned to her familiar black and white tailoring (Edwardian jackets, narrow trousers tucked into riding boots), albeit with some of the twisting volumes that made her Spring collection such a breath of fresh air.</p><p>So was this a case of playing it safe? The designer said it was more a matter of balance: the strength of black protecting the fragility of white. That idea came across strongest in a look that combined a softly draped white shirtdress and a stiff black leather brace, the upper straps of which buckled around the torso, while the ones below hung loose. Consider it a Demeulemeester take on a traditional corset. ""I wanted something to give women more of a masculine shape,"" she explained. A tough sell? Maybe not for fans of her brand of androgyny.</p><p>A more subtle interpretation came in the form of a delicate white poet blouse worn with a black waistcoat and narrow, slouchy pants. Other pieces—like heavy-gauge cardigan capes shaggy with fringe, and jackets layered with little vests embroidered all over with bells that jangled like a suit of armor—may not win her the converts that Spring's little dresses did, but they will be plenty pleasing to Demeulemeester loyalists.</p></div>"
16,fall,2009,f2009,anna-sui,"""If you're going to have a show, then have <em>a show</em>,"" said Anna Sui, gearing up in her office about a week before her Belle Époque extravaganza. It was obvious how much the designer—happy among her stacks of books, inspiration boards, and piles of 1890's-inspired jewelry from Erickson Beamon—enjoyed the process. Not that Sui wasn't mindful of the economy. She noted that she had made careful fabric choices to ensure that everything remained at a comfortable price point. But Sui, and the girl she dresses, does like to have fun. As front-row guest Taylor Momsen, an ideal member of the Sui demographic, put it: She has ""a different kind of spark.""</p><p>What lit Sui's imagination was Proust and the Paris of the Gay Nineties. She looked at pictures of its <em>grandes horizontales</em> and its art, as well as of Yves Saint Laurent's country retreat, where every room was named after a character in <em>Remembrance of Things Past</em>. The research resulted in a demimondaine's boudoir vibe (rose prints and velvet trims) with accents of more sober Rive Droite propriety (black velvet and soutache trim).</p><p>There was a lot of black—enlivened by lots of pattern, naturally—in a collection that was overlong and not without its heavy-handed moments. There was also a splashy saffron cardigan with rhinestone trim, a relatively tame brushed-wool plaid coat for the fainter of heart, and some great boots. It will be hard to decide between the colorful over-the-knee style and Sui's amazingly chic challenge to the Ugg boot. Way to kick it, Anna.</p></div>"
17,fall,2009,f2009,anne-valerie-hash,"For her couture presentation earlier this year, Anne Valérie Hash bid adieu to the Louvre in favor of her <em>dixième</em> arrondissement atelier, and she stuck with the more intimate space for her Fall show. As for the clothes, the designer said she began by thinking about ""very dark, protective tailoring."" That gave her the opportunity to put a few of her signature jumpsuits on the runway (this time in gray flannel and long-sleeved or strapless and worn over a metallic ribbed knit), as well as to experiment with the shoulder line of pantsuits. Hers were pinched about an inch or so down the back, so the silhouette was widened as well as heightened like a carapace.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of the design process, though, Hash said she changed tacks. ""We are all very tense,"" she said, alluding to the recession. ""We just need to relax."" So halfway through, the palette lightened—from navy, black, and charcoal to rose, apricot, teal, and silvery white—and so did the fabrics. A pair of dresses—one short with a 3-D effect, thanks to thin strips of silk stitched vertically from an illusion neckline; the other long and narrow and made from lace with horizontal bands of ruffs—captured her range. The common thread: They were both nearly weightless, a quality you could pick up on in the atelier setting.</p><p>On paper, the collection might sound like a clash of two ideas. In fact, it was one of Hash's best, as exemplified by the last look: a delicate blouse and tapering pants, both in blushing pink, that captured the masculine/feminine mix.</p></div>"
18,fall,2009,f2009,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi was a pretty well kept secret until Gwyneth Paltrow surprised everyone by wearing his trompe l'oeil corset dress to one of her premieres last year. That stirred curiosity about an Italian-British designer who, tortoiselike, has been steadily moving along years after many of the hares from his nineties generation have streaked into obscurity. The collection Berardi showed for Fall rewarded a second look: The quality has ramped up, he's added furs, and generally found a niche in which classy young women will now discover something genuinely interesting to wear.</p><p>He clinched all that at the outset with pale, soft, paillette-smothered dresses. Backed onto chiffon, they had movement and looked right dressed down with thick ribbed tights and suede shoe-boots. Berardi has also developed a rounded, raised shoulder that looked fresh on cropped jackets, coats, and a great little black dress (the structure, he admitted later, was gleaned from his knowledge of corsetry—it's cut from the same foam as molded bras). Thanks to collaborations with Saga furs and Crystallized Swarovski Elements, Berardi has also managed to add an extra level of luxe to his signature pieces. He patched fox and lynx onto knit in innovative ways, so that a trompe l'oeil gilet came with blue-sequined sweater sleeves, and jackets turned to show a back view featuring chunks of geometric crystal embroidered onto gray jersey. It was a small, concise statement from a designer who has found his voice—and there is more where that came from. Though he showed mostly evening on this runway, Berardi's pre-collection is full of great utilitarian outerwear and tailoring, too.</p></div>"
19,fall,2009,f2009,aquascutum,"British heritage labels used to be the preserve of classy ladies to such an extent that the incoming designers charged with updating them would run a mile rather than acknowledge those traditional customers. Not so this season at Aquascutum. Many a beloved and familiar British face was on the runway: Stella Tennant, Susie Bick, Yasmin LeBon, Cecilia Chancellor, and Jenny Howarth—a veritable roll call of great locally grown models of the eighties and nineties. The fact that they walked alongside members of the new generation, including London girls Jourdan Dunn and Daisy Lowe, sent the message that Aquascutum might have something for everyone.</p><p>Designer Michael Herz made his best argument for cross-generational accessibility in the rainwear, Aquascutum's original claim to fame. An innovative touch came in his ""two-for-one"" double-layered techno-taffeta coats, combining airy volume with functionality, and a couple of tie-on fur tippets (one fur, one mink) designed to transform any coat into something snugly and luxuriously warm. Maybe, though, the idea of addressing women in their forties or over—however right and exciting in principle—was something that made Herz suffer empathy-failure. It was hard to imagine that the grown women walking his runway would ever choose to wear a revived Aquascutum house check, or a puffy pink floral organdy dress, or something tuniclike cut out of crystal-sprinkled lace. New classy ladies (of any nationality) are not like the old guard, and some of these clothes would engender a natural fear of age-adding on sight. Maybe next season Herz should take things further and hire the stylish, fashion-experienced women he gathered on his runway as a focus group, not just a clutch of trophy models.</p></div>"
20,fall,2009,f2009,aquilano-rimondi,"The trials of Italy's newest talents, Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi, might soften the hardest heart. First they parted from the company under which they designed the 6267 label; then they signed up to Gianfranco Ferré, only to find that one season later, its owner, IT Holding SpA, has gone into administration, its future uncertain. Thankfully, however, the pair don't have all their eggs in one basket. Aquilano.Rimondi is their own, independently financed label, and given all other circumstances, it is now their one serious chance to prove what they're really about.</p><p>The focus seems to have done them nothing but good. The collection they showed had some of the most sophisticated, fashion-relevant tailoring in Milan: a neat, peak-shouldered, lean-torso tuxedo coat; a fabulously curvaceous gray pinstripe pantsuit; and draped-shouldered dresses fit for an old-time movie star. ""Good taste and chic are needed in fashion,"" said Aquilano. ""On the runway, you sometimes have to exaggerate, but we also just want to make clothes women will want to wear. And not to keep changing every season for the sake of it. Continuity matters.""</p><p>Their technical accomplishments (which have also been illustrated at Ferré, though in a more mannered way) are already not in question. Nor is the tuning of their antennae toward the defiant glamour of World War II, or their timely obsession with Elsa Schiaparelli, which brought out one of their best dresses, a black sheath with exaggerated, shocking-pink velvet sleeves. Where the designers did falter was in their overfussy puffed-up taffetas and overdecorated furs, which could have come from anyone in Milan. What Aquilano and Rimondi would be smart to realize now is that their specialness lies in their ability to cut a precise silhouette and to make clothes, like their fabulous tweed coat with fox fur sleeves, that could be worn in plenty of other places besides a cocktail party.</p></div>"
21,fall,2009,f2009,armand-basi-one,"It's amazing how quickly designers are burrowing down into the early eighties for inspiration, and who's coming back up with what. At Armand Basi, Markus Lupfer hit on an as-yet-unexplored seam: not the neon graffiti New York club scene beloved by Marc Jacobs, but the dark, furious, feminist fashion counterpoint that was exploding on the Paris runway at the same time, thanks to Comme des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto.</p><p>Oddly, the notes on seats credited Helmut Newton and the Bauhaus as sources, though Newton was hardly a known fan of stomping flat brothel-creepers; extreme drop-crotch pants; or the kind of figure-enveloping, giant-shouldered shapes Lupfer sent out. That's not to quarrel too much with what the designer actually showed: something between the monochrome moodiness of the Japanese and memories of that short-lived yet hard to forget New Wave poseur phase when the likes of Ultravox or A Flock of Seagulls were taking themselves awfully seriously. For trend hounds, that meant the collection ticked all the right sort of boxes with its coolly sloppy dolman-sleeved biker jackets, voluminous-shouldered capes, skinny knit leggings, and grommet-perforated asymmetric knitwear. Thankfully, Lupfer managed not to overstep the mark that would have turned it into editorial-only historical pastiche, making it the strongest collection he's yet turned out for the Spanish label.</p></div>"
22,fall,2009,f2009,azzaro,"Like the label's late founder, Loris Azzaro, Vanessa Seward knows her way around a little black dress. For Fall, the creative director of nearly five years' standing delivered plenty on that front, trimmed as usual in Swarovski crystals. Among the numbers that will have the longest legs outside her rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré showroom: a short tank dress edged front and back in a chain-link rhinestone pattern, a long-sleeved style with a big bow at the hem, and a third with swirls of silk and sparkling fringe wrapping around the torso.</p><p>For variety, there was a sweater dress in emerald green with matching crystal buttons. This was made in collaboration with April March, a young singer on the record label of Bertrand Burgalat, Seward's husband. (The designer has teamed up with Jemima Khan and Eugenie Niarchos in the past.) As for red-carpet prospects, the standout was a narrow column gown inset with black lace in back that was decorated with crystal violin finials, a nod in the direction of Seward's musical <em>mari</em>. But what really caught the eye was a silk blouse with teardrop-shaped cutouts at the neck worn with high-waisted tuxedo trousers. Pants weren't an Azzaro signature, but Seward's looked sharp. To keep the brand vital and growing, she would do well to come up with other ways of injecting more of her own imprint.</p></div>"
23,fall,2009,f2009,badgley-mischka,"""The beat goes on,"" said Mark Badgley backstage after today's show. ""It never makes sense to do something that we're not about."" What Badgley and his design partner, James Mischka, are about, recession or no, is great-looking dresses with a healthy dose of straight-up glamour—speaking of which, they are currently hard at work on two Oscar gowns. For all that, though, they kicked things off in a quietly minimal manner, sending out a group of smart all-black day looks. Some of these came from their lower-priced Platinum collection, which the duo went on to mix in throughout, because, noted Mischka, ""that's how women shop.""</p><p>Of course, the wattage was soon amped up. On the brighter end of the spectrum: a liquid-gold velvet that fell into a seductive low-necked cowl; eye-popping satins; and a slinky allover-sequin column, surely headed for a chanteuse near you. An asymmetrical frock with a sideways drape ending in a chunk of ruffles was too tricky, but overall this was a solid collection. Strongest, in fact, were looks with a modicum of austerity, like a one-shoulder, smoke-hued gown on Bruna Tenorio. With its strategic flutter of ruffles, it was easily the most elegant thing around.</p></div>"
24,fall,2009,f2009,balenciaga,"""It's Parisian,"" said Nicolas Ghesquière of the assured melding of drape, print, and tailoring he sent out in the sparkling daylight streaming into the Hôtel de Crillon. The designer had mined the Balenciaga archive, examined the structure of a drape-waisted forties redingote, thought over a later sari-inspired collection, and pulled up three late-sixties scarf prints. He took it from there to design a modern translation in satin, printed silk, and fragile dévoré velvet.</p><p>It made for a sumptuous collection that played down his sci-fi tendencies in favor of a softer femininity. The Ghesquière codes were in play, too, of course. The draping (which he's explored before) emerged first in swagged charmeuse skirts, suspended from a hip-hugging yoke, and then in a fluid, wrapped relation of the jodhpur shape he brought into fashion two years ago. The shoes could only have come from him: patchworked distillations of everything that was going on in the collection, with jersey print, mesh, suede, scarf ties, and a heavy walking-boot tread on the sole.</p><p>There was a sense that Ghesquière was walking a fine line between embracing pragmatism and pushing luxurious experimentation. He showed a creamy beige coat and an impeccable black tuxedo jacket with striped menswear pants. There was also a little black dress, along with shaved mink silhouettes appliquéd onto a knit base to wrap smoothly around the body as coat-dresses, all relatively plain. Mostly, though, it's the way Ghesquière worked print that will be pored over by fashion diagnosticians. Anyone on the lookout for eighties influences might see something <em>Dynasty</em> (though there was nothing ostentatious or literal about it) in the puffed shoulders of the spotted and streaked prints that were wrapped into dresses and fragile blouses. The word, in the end, was <em>sophistication</em>: Ghesquière didn't pull back on the Balenciaga insistence on developing couture-level handwork, but there was also a sense of reality that sent cohorts of pressured buyers out onto the Place de la Concorde with relieved smiles on their faces. ""Wearable"" and ""money in the bank,"" they were calling it. Not compliments they're throwing around easily in these strained times.</p></div>"
25,fall,2009,f2009,balmain,"Was it just coincidence that Christophe Decarnin showed his Balmain collection in the same room—the swimming pool at the Ritz—that Gianni Versace used for his couture spectaculars? There was certainly an almost Gianni-like gaggle of fans jostling outside, and a heated buzz of anticipation in the house for the man whose frank embrace of rock-chick bling, rounded ""tennis ball""-shouldered jackets, and elaborate jeans have shot him to the position of No. 1 most copied designer in the space of two seasons. The choice of venue only added to the sense of expectation heaped on Decarnin's performance as fashion's latest appointed savior of good-time, high-sparkle, downright sexy dressing.</p><p>Decarnin certainly proved he's the leader of the disco fever he has single-handedly triggered this season. He had the shortest, tightest body dresses witnessed anywhere: smothered in Swarovski crystal, flouncing up at the shoulder, tightly bound in satin drape or quilted, chain-wrapped black leather. The cult peaked-shoulder Balmain jacket was reiterated in force: same signature shape, now manifested as a leather biker as well as a tuxedo jacket, and often paired with new drapey harem pants or skinny jean-cut black trousers. Every look was thrust into deep-cuffed suede boots with a stack of silver buckles running up the side.</p><p>All that probably threw on enough fuel to keep Balmain on fire for the next season, not just with trophy-hunting girls who can afford the red-hot prices but also with the knock-off merchants who will be laughing all the way to bank while making an easy killing with stick-on glitter and the minimum yardage of Lycra and fake leather. In that way, Decarnin deserves acknowledgement for keeping the wheels of fast fashion turning. Exactly how far it's going to go is open to question, though. By halfway through the show, Decarnin's looks—the jacket, pant, and drapey T-shirt; the minuscule dress; and the half-train gown—were already into heavy rotation. If he's really going to win a place as the Versace of tomorrow, he'll have to come up with more than that next season.</p></div>"
26,fall,2009,f2009,band-of-outsiders,"A new partnership with an Italian mill that produces collections for some of the top Parisian design houses yielded Boy by Band of Outsiders' most serious effort to date. ""I used to cut my womenswear pieces from the same fabric I used for the men's,"" designer Scott Sternberg said at the show. ""This affords us the ability to approach things properly."" That was clear from today's polished tableau-style presentation, which was inspired by the chic French student revolutionaries in Godard's <em>La Chinoise</em> and featured models slouching against old-fashioned lamp posts or lounging on wrought-iron beds.</p><p>These clothes should appeal to a broader audience than Spring's more trend-driven offerings. There were wide trousers cut in tweed and corduroy, several—if not one too many—oversize striped mohair sweaters, and an array of the sharply tailored jackets Boy is known for. This focus on straightforward basics with a twist—or as the designer put it, ""fetishized American sportswear""—should ensure that soon former campaign girl Kirsten Dunst and her ilk won't be the only ones in on the secret.</p></div>"
27,fall,2009,f2009,barbara-tfank,"What else other than Adele's <em>19</em> would be playing at Barbara Tfank's presentation in the sunny penthouse at the Carlyle? Tfank, of course, dressed the soulful Grammy-winning Brit singer last Sunday for her big night in a custom dress and jewel-toned evening coat. ""It's been so busy,"" said the designer, who also recently outfitted actresses Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan for the Berlin Film Festival. This recent swirl of twentysomething talent in Tfank's rarefied world seemed to have an influence on her fall lineup—seen in the pairing of plain wool coats with eveningwear; quirky motifs, like a hummingbird-print silk and a snowflake jacquard chiffon; and even in the addition of a slight platform to her collaborative Olivia Morris shoes. Whatever the reason, there was a refreshing lightness here amid the usual meticulous polish. Though Tfank's timelessness is a strength, it's a treat to see it evolve. We wish more smart young things her way.</p></div>"
28,fall,2009,f2009,basso-brooke,"Bruno Basso and Christopher Brooke are the Pixar of clothes. You stare fixedly at their stuff and wonder exactly what it is and how they did it, so hornswoggling are the effects they achieve with their digital prints. This season's exploration of Louis XIV's baroque and rococo was a match made in fashion heaven because it gave the duo an opportunity to render the Sun King's 3-D opulence in 2-D print form. Ormolu, pearls, lace, laurel leaves, Louis' favorite moiré, not to mention various architectural details of his palace Versailles—all were rendered in exquisite detail and sumptuous color. (Know ye this—Bruno Basso has 16 million hues at his digital fingertips. A human eye can barely register a fraction of them.)</p><p>One striking effect was the detailing of a dress refracted into an abstract kaleidoscope of color to match the coat that accompanied it. It got even better with a wool trench printed so convincingly to mimic chinchilla that you could almost feel the caress of fur against the skin. Basso &amp; Brooke know that a simple silhouette is the best canvas for their extraordinary work (well, usually they know—one dress, printed with scales like armor, flared into an unfortunate peplum that screeched <em>Mommie Dearest</em>). For the most part, the clothes were shifts, shirtdresses, simple tops and skirts, the better to be completely transfigured by the designers' prints.</p><p>For the specific and discerning clientele who are likely to respond to such work, this felt like revisionist luxury: an opulent look; an easy, light feel. True, these dresses had almost nothing to do with fall dressing, but you could imagine them rolled in a bag and carted off to more clement climes. Back in the showroom, there was a beautifully cut plain black coat, its broad shoulder tempered by a little pleat. Think of it as the sartorial equivalent of the restoratively head-clearing coffee beans you smell before plunging back into a round of scent sniffing.</p></div>"
29,fall,2009,f2009,bcbg-max-azria,"At BCBG Max Azria, designing couple Max and Lubov built their Fall collection around the bold geometric abstraction of constructivism. Logically, shapes were of clear importance, both with respect to silhouette, as in the volume of blouson coats; and to construction, in, say, the sleek panels of velvet and silk pieced together on dresses. With robotic-looking metallic tights, bands of trapunto stitching, and jutting sharp lines on shoulders, the effect was often a bit ""beam me up,"" even with mitigating crafty touches of shibori tie-dye and pleating. Things did loosen up a touch with a group of slinky little jersey dresses, high-necked in front, sexy and skin-revealing from behind, but overall, this collection skewed too serious for a line that's billed as a contemporary younger-sister brand. Perhaps it's because the Azrias' newest line, BCBGeneration—an even more casual (and less expensive) addition to the stable—is now a year old, making this label the middle child. Still, that probably doesn't change the fact that the BCBG girl—like Lily Collins, Amanda Bynes, Joy Lauren, and the rest of the starlet-stocked front row—doesn't really want to think too hard about the future when she goes out. She still just wants to have fun.</p></div>"
30,fall,2009,f2009,behnaz-sarafpour,"As much as Behnaz Sarafpour has an obvious soft spot for a bow or a bit of lace, she's never been one for full-on froufrou. But for Fall, her already clean sense of American sportswear acquired a harder, slicker edge, as telegraphed by her program notes, which were decorated with shadow images of Alexander Calder mobiles. There was still some Park Avenue 10022 in this collection, although it had clearly derived its new direction from Paris' <em>premier arrondissement</em>. The main takeaway here was a graphic sculpted dress or tunic top worn with lean matte-black stretch pants. Sarafpour poured on more flinty glamour with an ombré fox-fur chubby and a grouping of black cutout dresses. There were the usual pretty little dresses, too—a pleated ombré number with cap sleeves and another in a trompe l'oeil ruffle print—as well as a camel coat with flattened bows on its pockets, worn over a silk blouse and tweed cigarette pants. Sweeter still, though frankly somewhat confounding, was a bobby-soxer ensemble of a long black sweater paired with a tulle circle skirt. Ultimately, this style tug-of-war ended in a draw.</p></div>"
31,fall,2009,f2009,betsey-johnson,"There were no cartwheels from Betsey Johnson for the first time in what feels like forever…because there was no catwalk. Instead, she invited a smaller crowd to ""Betsey Crocker's Kitchen"" in her showroom. Yes, folks, the designer who played Peter Pan for Spring reinvented herself as Julia Child. ""It's a happy, eating/drinking show with hot waiter guys,"" Johnson said with typical zaniness.</p><p>Fashion's most playful designer (who recently sold part of her company and is working with some new people) is having a moment. A new generation, too young to have Betseyed in the nineties, much less the eighties, is discovering her charms. There were rumors aloft that she might do a collaboration with Target, and it's known for sure that she is about to debut an archive collection with Opening Ceremony (the groovy store/showroom/gallery) this fall.</p><p>Looking either like extras from a raunchy Ellen von Unwerth shoot or like Cyndi Lauper, the models wore rose prints, lace, and petticoats. Forced to think more commercially, too—as are most of her colleagues—Johnson also showed T-shirts from her soon-to-launch tee line as well as sweat suit separates. ""It's artsy yet very real,"" she said, unsinkably, in a preshow interview. ""It's a trip, trip, trip, trip."" Some girls, come what may, will always just want to have fun.</p></div>"
32,fall,2009,f2009,bibhu-mohapatra,"Bibhu Mohapatra may not be a name that trips off the tongue, but the buzz for his debut collection, shown yesterday by appointment, is ringing clear as a bell. The attention is deserved. Mohapatra, who spent eight years at J. Mendel, left his design director post at the end of 2007 and in the time since has been researching and putting together this rock-solid debut. The designer merged his elegant evening experience with a pair of hard-edged inspirations: ancient Japanese armor and fashion warrior Daphne Guinness. The 21 looks he showed did their dance between hard and soft, fantasy and reality, with only a few missed steps. Both beautiful and wearable was a coat in the exotic fabric of peacock feather-loomed wool. Mohapatra said his dream would be to dress Freida Pinto for the Oscars. There isn't much time left for Mohapatra's work to make it to the red carpet next weekend, but expect to see a lot more of it in the months to come.</p></div>"
33,fall,2009,f2009,blumarine,"Leopard spots, Stephen Sprouse, and Andy Warhol gone Latin: Those were the unmissables at Anna Molinari's relentlessy cheerful Blumarine. Unless Azzedine Alaïa is seriously put out by the referencing of his seminal eighties leopard signatures—from top to toe, not forgetting the matching clutch—it was hard to imagine anyone feeling curmudgeonly about the sheer brazen up-ness of it all. If <em>ragazzi</em> just wanna have fun next fall, this is a company that will deliver it—in neons with crystal, and featuring lots of sexy ""biker"" and Balmain-esque jacket-and-flashy-jeans combos as further options.</p><p>Shamelessly kitsch the show may have been—Ms. Molinari projected a pseudo-Warhol portrait of herself on the backdrop—but, funnily enough the content was not 100 percent cheese. The designer's Italian-quality knitwear holds up to scrutiny, and when her sweater dresses were paired with well-tailored coats, it qualified as a reasonably chic grown-up look. All that was forgotten, of course, once she started up with the sub-Warhol flower-print leggings, sugar-pastel satin mini-suits, and an orgy of neon leopard chiffon disco gowns. Then again, the single-minded mission to keep good-time girls happy in a bad time also has a certain honor in it.</p></div>"
34,fall,2009,f2009,bottega-veneta,"Tomas Maier's remedy for breaking the downward spiral of depression is irresistible glamour. ""With all that's going on, I just switched off the TV news and thought about designing appetizing clothes to make women feel pretty and attractive,"" he said before the show. ""Let's get out of this!"" That rallying cry made for possibly his most resolved and beautiful collection yet—gently done, yet spiked with a new undercurrent of eroticism.</p><p>It began with simple rectangles of cloth—folded into ivory envelope coats or pieced into fluid charmeuse dresses—and then built momentum through perfectly cut sheaths. One number—essentially a single square of black wool with armholes, wrapped to fall in a ruffle in the front while dipping asymmetrically over the shoulder—looked as if it had been wound around Sasha Pivovarova almost spontaneously. Of course, there's more than spareness of cut going on here. The desirabilty is in Maier's fabrics, some of which are so refined even the camera can't pick up the nuances. The second look out—a cream coat over a strapless dress—passed within inches of the noses of the audience, but who knew the coat was covered with a fine layer of organza, or realized the dress was not a matte cotton canvas but leather? Only the woman who wore it, or someone close enough to stroke her. Which is Bottega Veneta's not-for-public-consumption code in a nutshell.</p><p>And yet: This is a time when even the stealthily wealthy need an extra push to open their finely crafted <em>intrecciato</em> crocodile purses. That's where drop-dead sex and glamour step in. Lingerie corseting built into the rib section of covered-up jersey dresses, outlining braless breasts, did that in an outrageously classy way. And then came a sequence of pleated goddess dresses, catching the air as the girls swept past. They were superb.</p></div>"
35,fall,2009,f2009,brian-reyes,"Brian Reyes designs for a strong woman, whether she reigns over the Upper East Side or calls downtown home. The reference points for his latest collection were suitably powerful. Reyes looked at stone quarries the world over to turn out what he labeled ""a sharp collection full of classic shapes with graphic elements."" Some beautiful prints, derived from images of marble and limestone distorted to the point that they resembled snakeskin, adorned sleeveless dresses and little skirts. These pieces were then intricately pleated and folded until they came to resemble a cross section of one of those quarries. If there was a fault, it was that the collection didn't exactly scream ""Fall."" Bare legs and lightweight silk might work for winter in Reyes' hometown of Bogotá, but the rest of us, however strong, need something more substantial.</p></div>"
36,fall,2009,f2009,bruno-pieters,"Backstage, Bruno Pieters mentioned Eckhart Tolle's book <em>A New Earth</em> as a source of inspiration. Apparently, it got him thinking about evolution, out of which evolved a color palette that ranged from shimmering black to forest green to metallic-bronze tweed. But never mind the natural colors; this Belgian designer doesn't do earthy. In step with last season, he approached his tailored coat-dresses and skirtsuits with a mathematical precision—piecing them together from squares and triangles; inserting origami-like panels at the waistline; planting large, flat bows at the neck; and layering the sharp, fitted results over second-skin turtlenecks, platform pumps, and opaque black tights.</p><p>With their shiny black-red lips and severe samurai ponytails, many of which were obscured by big hoods, the models looked like members of a uniformed tribe from outer space. As for where the collection fits back on terra firma, there were a few elements that stood out in the rather narrowly focused whole: Pieters' little jackets and capes, for example, could be contenders for the kind of girl who wants a subtle, anonymous take on the season's dominant shoulder.</p></div>"
37,fall,2009,f2009,burberry-prorsum,"Christopher Bailey's opinion on how fashion should respond to the times is succinct and businesslike: ""It should have a point of view. Burberry's is outerwear, and that's what I've worked on here, from the casual shell of a trench to luxe furs."" So his Fall collection was rooted in the familiar. He took a well-worn British theme—the arty intellectuals of the Bloomsbury group of the twenties and thirties—and saw it through in a continuation of the muted palette of browns, grays, and neutrals that have become a Burberry fixture in the past few seasons.</p><p>The wide, sloppy, unfitted English-eccentric silhouette of the coats and drop-waisted dresses favored by Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell is a soft alternative to the sharp, body-conscious look stalking so many other runways. The comfortable, shrug-on outer pieces were, as Bailey pledged, the main attraction. A butter-soft sand-colored suede trench (Bailey's knowing nod to the suede trend rising everywhere) opened the show, followed later by a standout oversize shearling jacket and various furs, shaved narrow in the sleeve and body and left to fluff out below.</p><p>For anyone seeking an easy way to dress for Fall (and there will be many who balk at facing up to the eighties again), the loose, waist-defying dresses over thick ribbed tights and chunky high walking boots might seem a good way to get out of the door without fuss. A harder sell, whichever way you look at them, are the calf-length Donegal tweed kilts and any dress or coat that came with a raised waist and full skirt in one of the heavier fabrics. Cute models might just about get away with it on a runway, but the rump-magnifying potential of those would surely daunt anyone but the most stolid of traditional Burberry English country ladies.</p></div>"
38,fall,2009,f2009,calvin-klein-collection,"If the minimalism of Francisco Costa's Spring show veered into sci-fi territory, Fall has come back to earth—and to the body. Whereas last season was all about soft, three-dimensional geometries, the focus now is on fabrics and texture. Costa opened with a black coat with an asymmetrical neckline and a crescent hem that was pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle from wool and silk jacquard. He worked that paneling motif into a sleeveless sheath with slightly built-up shoulders, a bold flap jacket, and even a clingy knit mock turtleneck worn with a trim and neat pencil skirt.</p><p>Continuing on, his experiments with surface treatments produced a skirtsuit from a holey felted wool that looked like lace and a gorgeous one-shoulder dress (in a season full of them) with plissé detail trailing across the bust. A laser-cut velvet dress in sulfur—when Costa deviates from black or charcoal, it's for something that really pops—proved once and for all that minimalism doesn't have to mean masculine. Which gets back to the point about the body. These were rigorous, defined, precise clothes, but they were also sexy. Nicely done.</p></div>"
39,fall,2009,f2009,carlos-miele,"""Each season I fall more in love with architecture,"" Carlos Miele said backstage, discussing the graphic geometric prints that anchored his latest effort. Although some of his patterned eveningwear felt too busy for even the most vivacious São Paulinas, of which there were a few in attendance, a burn-out technique applied to mink coats had better results. Miele once collaborated with Sol LeWitt, the American artist known for spatial manipulation, and the experience has clearly stayed with him; hence the origamilike detail on boleros and the designer's signature gowns.</p><p>Before he started designing for the red carpet, the Brazilian made a name for himself with denim in his native country. A new ultra-luxe jean line, introduced today, is a smart strategy to lure stateside customers who think of Miele only for special occasions.</p></div>"
40,fall,2009,f2009,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera believes in pretty. The world as we know it is crumbling around us, but you wouldn't think so looking at her lovely collection—and there's a certain strength in maintaining that sense of poise under pressure. If she acknowledged the recession at all, she did so by forsaking the elaborate embroideries she usually favors. In their place were rich, textured fabrics, be it the metallic gazar of a blouse and corset, the glinting lace of a high-waisted skirt, or the forest-green striped cloque of a corset gown and matching scarf. Herrera has always had an eye for special materials, and for Fall there was an almost three-dimensional two-tone jacquard—lapis blue with gray, or cassis with caviar. She used it to great, graphic effect, accentuating the curves of the waist on a long-sleeved day dress, a narrow pantsuit, and a swagged one-shoulder gown alike.</p><p>Despite a concentration on grand eveningwear, the collection didn't feel stuffy. A double-faced crepe jacket was tossed over a fils coupe long dress in the same shade of blue, while a substantial copper waist-cincher finished off the asymmetrical bodice of a gown with one bracelet sleeve and the other strap languidly slipping from the model's bare shoulder. Herrera may have used copper—not gold—in this case, but at this house it's still a gilded existence.</p></div>"
41,fall,2009,f2009,catherine-malandrino,"Catherine Malandrino was one of this week's many venue-switchers, trading the Chelsea Art Museum for the Rainbow Room. With a rotating circular floor set at a perspective-skewing 65 floors skyward, it was a suitable locale for the designer's surrealist-themed collection, named—what else?—""Over the Rainbow."" Much of it paid direct homage to surreal fashion's first lady, Elsa Schiaparelli. On the back of a wool coat, for example, was a leather appliqué of two profile silhouettes that with a blink turn into a vase—a motif originally designed for Schiap by Jean Cocteau. But the backward bun hairdos, seamed stockings, and net-covered faces echoed the work of those more recent surr-torialists, Viktor &amp; Rolf. Ultimately, though, such a criticism is beside the point with Malandrino, a retail dynamo whose fan club, both civilian and celebrity, will be more than happy with her new lean mid-calf silhouette dress and classic and sexy pointelles.</p></div>"
42,fall,2009,f2009,central-saint-martins,"Is there any way of reading the future of fashion by looking at the work of its newborns—the first cohort of talent that has the misfortune to be graduating into the hideous job market of 2009? Hard to say, but if there are clues, they're going to be found at Central Saint Martins' M.A. show, where Professor Louise Wilson famously drags the originality out of the international students who come, begging to join a course that's regarded as one of fashion's toughest and best finishing schools.</p><p>What's certain is there's no sign of either despondency or fake optimism here—or of clutching onto the safety of worn-out references. Instead, what was on display looked like different facets of a clean-cut, colorful futurism that managed to ignore any association with eighties Starship <em>Enterprise</em> or sixties space-age cliché.

Laura Mackness played a rigorous but witty game with double-knit jersey shifts over leggings in pink, grass green, and bright yellow, accented with funny placements of dots, knee patches, glove cutouts, and eyes.

As official participants in London fashion week, they know this is their privileged opportunity to advertise themselves to the world. In more normal times, a good few of them would be thinking of starting out on their own, as Christopher Kane did three years ago. But what awaits them now? It takes more than a recession to shake their professor's faith in what they have to offer. After the show, she shook her head and said, ""With the research skills and portfolios these kids have, there will always be people who want them. In fact, I know there are already. I just can't say who.""</p></div>"
43,fall,2009,f2009,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan is one of fashion's least likely suspects to have developed a late interest in sexy dressing. Yet for Fall, that's what seems to have come over him. With hemlines sliced to buttock-grazing level, thigh-high waders suspended from bondage garters, and a glimpse of leather corseting under cutout tailoring, it was, to say the least, a bit of a surprise.</p><p>Followers of Chalayan's interest in high concept might have been more focused on his use of art-based technological fabrics. The first pieces he sent out looked almost like faceted gray concrete—they were, in fact, acetate foam—shaped into coats, funnel-neck tops, and abbreviated dresses. He'd named the collection ""Earthbound""—referring to the way he'd looked at the urban streets around him in London. That gave rise, later, to prints of fences, asphalt, and manhole covers, all in shades of gray.</p><p>Like so many others, Chalayan also used his international-audience airtime to show his selling pieces: a couple of good leather jackets, and regular, honed-down black coats and blazers. Still, this was not a season in which Chalayan mustered one of his mind-blowingly memorable performances, and the high-minded intelligentsia that pays avid attention to his every thought might just need a little push to see itself getting out and about with so much body on show.</p></div>"
44,fall,2009,f2009,chanel,"In a season when coat-dresses and skirtsuits have risen to somewhere near the top of the item charts, Chanel presented a series of fashion's most poised and charming versions. That formula transmitted some of the loveliness of Karl Lagerfeld's sublime origami-paper Spring Couture collection into super-feminine white collar and cuff treatments—frothy plissé ruffs, chiffon camellias, and French maid frills encircled the neck or sleeves on soft, fitted black silhouettes. Cleverly, today's outing also achieved a rare balance between being grown-up and youthful—a note set by the casting of Karen Elson to open the show. Here was a fabulous-looking 30-year-old woman, rather than some anonymous waif.</p><p>Lagerfeld tagged the collection ""Belle Brummell,"" a gender-reassigned quip referring to the British Regency dandy who dictated men's fashion by tying his cravats in ever more elaborate configurations. The pun also gave full permission to bring the classic Chanel white georgette blouse into play, a perfect device for subtracting the austerity from black in a distinctly Rue Cambon manner. Lagerfeld worked it every which way, in bouclé, lace, knit, satin, and paillettes, while also making a witty swerve in the direction of the season's motorcycle leathers (interpreted here in slim drop-waist dresses) and puffer jackets.</p><p>What color there was turned up in brief passages of pale green or baby pink. Admittedly, that green wasn't the most felicitous shade in the palette for clothing, but it was really there to underline the presence of the jade Deco-style pendants and neckpieces—a further echo of which could be found in the jade rings implanted in several pairs of heels. All in all, though, this wasn't one of Chanel's more playful simultaneous broadcasts to the world—more a serious reinforcement of the brand's eternal attractions.</p></div>"
45,fall,2009,f2009,charles-anastase,"Someone had fun writing Charles Anastase's show notes. ""The gutter of romanticism""? ""Defiled refinery""? A wordy way to convey the manner in which the high-waisted, tiered, full-skirted, fairy-tale silhouette Anastase has made his own was, this time, tattered and spattered. One reference point for the collection was ""the spirit of Kurt Cobain."" The ghost of grunge did seem to hover over the mixing and matching of pieces that could have been harvested from a charity shop: a pink angora coat over a rugby-striped dress, say, or a leopard-print bed jacket over a flaring black skirt, or a tiny plaid jacket worn with over-dyed purple denims. The styling and the shoes—a towering combat-platform boot—fit with the idea. But Anastase was mortified that anyone would read something so literal into his designs.</p><p>""This isn't retro, it's autobiography,"" he insisted. ""It's the clothes we were wearing when I was an adolescent."" Yes, they were from a charity shop, but Anastase and friends would customize them, hand-painting them and adding found bits and pieces till they were unrecognizable. The same notion animated a patchworked velvet skirt and all the items in the collection that were painted or scribbled on, like the ""dementia"" blouse. It wasn't hard to imagine the precocious teen Anastase working his neighborhood's last nerve with such provocations. The problem is, they still look kind of adolescent. Footnote: Anastase debuted some menswear, including a black leather jacket with ""Malia Obama"" writ large across its back. He said that was his way of expressing his positive feelings about America's new president.</p></div>"
46,fall,2009,f2009,charlotte-ronson,"""Art Deco"" and ""wartime dressing"" were a couple of the reference points Charlotte Ronson threw around backstage before her Fall 2009 show, but there were plenty of leather and studs to keep things current. Less girly than past efforts, today's collection hit its stride with pantsuits and body-con minidresses featuring strong eighties shoulders and a slim silhouette. Though some details felt out of place (cutout elbows and slashed sleeves were said to be a nod to rationed fabrics during World War II), it's doubtful the Ronson girl—including sisters Annabelle and Samantha, who lent their modeling and DJ skills to today's production—is too hung up on historical accuracy.</p></div>"
47,fall,2009,f2009,chloe,"Chloé has been struggling to get its mojo back since Phoebe Philo departed, which is rather a long time ago now. After several swift turns of the revolving door in the design studio, Hannah MacGibbon is now at the desk, and after a somewhat rushed and skimpy debut last season, she's showing signs of getting a grip. What came out for Fall was a soft version of the early eighties, all big blanket coats, high-waisted fluid pants, wrapped belts, and, for evening, a much-needed dose of the easy glamour Chloé has been missing.</p><p>MacGibbon said she'd found her bearings by looking at illustrations by Antonio Lopez. For day, she passed through khaki, beige, and loden coatings, pleated pants, and suede shorts (she's a girl who loves them), supplying enough realistic pieces to give buyers something to go on. But it was the eveningwear that took off. Her dark green velvet pants cuffed with crystal and the slouchy black velvet overalls hit a nice semi-casual note for girls who have the confidence to walk into a party in flats (albeit pretty special ones, with bows and sparkle attached). As MacGibbon notched up the formality with a one-shouldered black velvet jumpsuit with a drapey wide-hip, narrow-ankle silhouette bound with a satin cummerbund, she was hitting a spot that evoked something of Saint Laurent. There were probably too many drifty, semi-sheer dresses, but generally, this show put Chloé back on a firmer footing, especially in the footwear department. A pair of frill-cuffed, dark green suede, thigh-high pirate boots just have it in them to cause a Chloé It-object sensation, just like the old days.</p></div>"
48,fall,2009,f2009,chloe-sevigny-for-o-c-,"""My references are all over the map,"" said Chloë Sevigny, ""from skinheads to Connecticut kids to St. Mark's Place. But this all really started because I wanted to make a pink flannel shirt!"" The result: androgyny with an indie/preppy slant. Sevigny's second collaboration with Opening Ceremony is a menswear collection that also comes scaled down to fit girls. The low-key mish-mash of moleskin pants, wool bombers (with matching backpacks), Fair Isles, long johns, oversize leopard and tiger knits, and other retooled Brit street-tribe and American classics were being worn by a group of friends and street-cast locals who mooched around at the Double Club in London. The laid-back Sunday scene was a hastily convened pit stop for Sevigny, who was briefly en route from Wales to Spain to finish a biopic of Howard Marks with Rhys Ifans. (Though it wasn't such a flying visit that she couldn't find time to score a pair of vintage high-waisted zip-sided black leather Montana shorts at Rellick, which she had on with one of her own shell-pink camp shirts and killer biker-style multi-strapped wedges.) One thing Sevigny has right is proportion and sizing—technically trickier to pull off in a unisex line than it might appear. The accessories, too, are strong: Western belts, creepers, and a collaboration with Bass that includes penny loafers and saddle shoes. Seeing Sevigny in the high-waisted, pleat-front trousers she describes as ""a full David Bowie-Ossie Clark pant"" might also be enough to convince anyone that boy style works. The reservation, though, is the quality of the fabric—a letdown compared with the styling.</p></div>"
49,fall,2009,f2009,chris-benz,"A little-known fact about Chris Benz: He's a real estate addict who scouts properties in his free time. This goes a long way toward explaining his unusual choice of venues: For Fall it was a raw warehouse space in Chelsea that once stored road salt but became, in Benz's imagination, a guerilla club for the woman who wants ""to escape into the darkness of downtown from her Upper East Side town house."" She can run, but she can't hide, not if she's dressed by Chris Benz. His autumnal palette featured Yves Klein blue, yellow, and fire-engine red, applied to wools and cottons and even to metallic-foiled leather and fur.</p><p>As always, there were quirky takes on preppy staples, including an evening skirt done up in coppery sequins and paired with a charmeuse tee, an anorak of color-blocked sheared mink, and a blazer paired with a strapless peplum dress. These had less of a deliberate ""granny's attic"" quality than they had in the past, and more straightforward confidence. They were ""designed,"" the J.Crew alum said, for people ""to buy"" (in other words, specifically with an eye toward what pieces had sold best in recent seasons). Are you listening, Michelle Obama?</p></div>"
50,fall,2009,f2009,christian-cota,"""Nature shows us that there's always beauty in upheaval,"" Christian Cota wrote in his program notes. The Mexican-born designer, who won the Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award a few weeks ago, kept things down-to-earth for Fall quite literally, incorporating pebblelike embroidery and a mineral print into his collection. Cota, who trained with Angel Sanchez and debuted with eveningwear four seasons ago, showed that he was able to shake things up with this collection. ""Instead of uptown chic he went a bit more crazy and youthful,"" said model and fellow countrywoman Liliana Dominguez, who was in the audience. She wasn't the only one who noticed Cota's evolution. The shift in his work is deliberate. Sure, there were some overwrought looks, but overall the collection was cleaner, hemlines were shorter, and there were even a few sporty elements, like a terrific jersey blazer worn over a cocktail look. ""When I started, it was all about fantasy. I am learning more about my client and am changing the way I am designing,"" Cota explained.</p></div>"
51,fall,2009,f2009,christian-dior,"Squaring circles is the name of the game for every established house this season. In a nutshell: How do you keep customers (i.e., freaked-out department stores and skeptical, reality-seeking shoppers) onside, while also keeping up the dialogue with fashion? At Dior, John Galliano found an easy compromise with a collection lightly based on the orientalism of Paul Poiret, an artistic Parisian craze dating back almost a century. No need for frantic reference-Googling here: The main point of Galliano's device is that it gave access to the areas of harem pants, rich gilded brocades, and Asian influences in general. Christian Dior never went East himself, certainly, but the notion wove ikat patterns, cheongsam fastenings, paisley prints, and those newly fashionable trousers into the house codes in a way that came out making sense for the many markets Galliano has to juggle.</p><p>Happily, there was no sense of straining for a recession solution about it. After treating Dior's standard suitings to a light, shortened adaptation of Poiret's hobble skirt, Galliano moved on to paisley-print day dresses and thence to the drapey harems (best in cream satin with a pale beige astrakhan gilet). That opened a neat portal through which Galliano's romantic, silver filigree Indian-embroidered chiffon cocktail and evening dresses could pass, looking effortlessly pretty. The result: grown-up fare for regular women, editorial-grade styling to appeal to the fashion press, and, in total, a clever feat of simultaneous translation from a well-traveled designer who knows how to reach his global markets.</p></div>"
52,fall,2009,f2009,christian-lacroix,"Things have come to a pretty pass in Paris when the little gold chairs of couture salons are being transported to grimy inner-city car parks for fashion folk to sit on. Such was the surreal cost-cutting scenario at Christian Lacroix's Fall show, and it might have brought on a loud chorus of moans had the clothes not been good enough to shut up the discomforted, over-shuttled, footsore audience. Delightfully, they were.</p><p>Christian Lacroix has got into a great groove with his ready-to-wear. From beginning to end, it was like watching a miniaturized, much more wearable version of one of his couture shows but with all the daintiness and charm left in. His signatures ran from little bubble-backed peacoats with a V silhouette to Edwardian leg-of-mutton-sleeved cardigans, through inimitably draped navy chiffon and seventies pantsuits, all the way through to mini-crini party dresses with bows on the shoulder. The accessories, too, were pure essence of Lacroix: lace or flower-printed tights, gold jeweled belts, tippets of fur or fake flowers to tie on with ribbons, and deliciously fragile whittled-heel patent wedge sandals with pointy toes and velvet trimmings. In the end, Lacroix had made a call even the grumpiest arrival couldn't contest: Save on the peripherals, and sink all the money and effort into design.</p></div>"
53,fall,2009,f2009,christopher-kane,"""She's a bit of a twisted sister, I suppose,"" said Christopher Kane of the girl he had in mind while designing his collection, thinking over the somber colors and the <em>Natural Born Killers</em> soundtrack that played through his Fall show. It was a slightly disconcerting shift to see the young designer who first hit headlines with a rainbow of neon-bright sexy dresses turning to gray and black, flat lace-ups, and tartan cashmere, and even apparently referencing the black-and-white grid patterns of fellow Glaswegian Charles Rennie Mackintosh in his graphic, ribbon-appliquéd dresses. Yet young designers are meant to surprise and change. If there was a new sense of street reality in the shearling-and-leather motorcycle jacket, the boyish trousers, and the first appearance of Christopher Kane tailoring in charcoal cashmere, he made it look refreshing. It was as cool as any hip girl could want, yet in that short opening passage, Kane also widened the collection to include other, more grown-up women who are always on the lookout for a perfectly tailored classic jacket (especially if it has Savile Row credentials, as this one does, courtesy of a collaboration with Norton &amp; Sons).</p><p>As for the dresses, Kane can apparently do no wrong either technically or in the eyes of the audience he's attracting, whatever the cost of the handcrafting involved. What he achieved in appliquéing this collection's stripes on organza, making the geometry intersect in blocks or spiral around skirts and sometimes break into vertical ripples in hemlines, is extraordinary. (For the record, Kane said Rennie Mackintosh never entered his head while he was designing; it was more the stripes on a blank TV screen that started him off.) Most interesting, though, is the point Natalie Massenet of Net-a-Porter was making outside his show. The organza scalloped dresses from Kane's Spring collection sold out on her site three times within a couple of weeks of delivery. ""What we're noticing is that women who like Oscar de la Renta are also happy to buy Christopher, because they like its femininity and quality,"" she said, ""as well as the cachet of discovering someone new."" Somehow, Kane's creating a crossover product that is going places no one would ever imagine a young London designer could reach.</p></div>"
54,fall,2009,f2009,collette-dinnigan,"After a few seasons of playing catch the trend, Collette Dinnigan returned to her strengths for Fall, and wouldn't you know it? The trends have caught up with her. Slipdresses have been big news at Paris' important collections, which means Dinnigan's practiced versions should prove alluring to retailers and customers shopping for the look for less. The collection was mostly in black, but it didn't feel dark or brooding. A silver beaded tank dress with metallic lace ruffling at the neckline looked like a good time. And for something more dramatic but just as youthful, there was an Edwardian white lace blouse tucked into a strapless black lace gown with crinoline skirts. Dinnigan usually emerges for her bow arm in arm with a couple of models, but this time, in a new smaller venue, she walked out alone—she must've known she'd got it right.</p></div>"
55,fall,2009,f2009,comme-des-garcons,"Whatever Rei Kawakubo is evoking in her shows can never be captured by a laundry list of fabrics and shapes: It's all about the emotional tension. For a woman of very few words (at least in English) and seemingly iron reserve, the feelings she can unleash are unruly and hard to name, yet always seem to be getting at something near the knuckle. This season, the mood felt poignant, a mysterious welling up of symbolism caused by looking at multiple layers of flesh-colored tulle, veiled face masks, and pyramidal layerings constructed from pieces of jackets, sweaters, and parts of blankets. Were these vulnerable innocents abroad cocooned in protective layers against the harshness of the world?</p><p>""Wonderland,"" Kawakubo called it afterward, ""where nothing is as it seems."" There was something of trompe l'oeil involved, in a childlike kind of way. Naked toes were sketched on the uppers of men's lace-ups and moccasins, and the outlines of jackets were drawn on the front of some garments. Tailcoats were superimposed on larger greatcoats. Sections of khaki fatigues, or maybe military tents, were collaged in. Ethnic blanket prints became involved, too. And then, finally, there were super-fragile silhouettes that had pale, padded blanket edgings sewn in to indicate vestigial jackets. Conclusions were hard to draw, unless it was an allusive statement about the difficulty of understanding anything in these most confusing of times.</p><p>As to wearability? Once dismantled and seen on a rail in the Comme des Garçons showroom, Kawakubo's work normally becomes easier to incorporate into a real wardrobe. At a guess, there will be many coat options, and the netting pieces could translate as useful styling accessories over cocktail or eveningwear. And anyway: Kawakubo is so smart at retail practice that she will undoubtedly (as always) be rendering the ideas in this collection down to a line of T-shirts.</p></div>"
56,fall,2009,f2009,costello-tagliapietra,"Instead of lying low and playing it safe, Jeffrey Costello and Robert Tagliapietra decided to go for ""all-out Irving Penn"" glamour. ""We were sick of hearing about the recession,"" Tagliapietra explained.</p><p>A dress with striking angular jodhpur sleeves was the most Pennsian in a lineup that was more shapely and sculpted than ever before. The duo's virtuosity was evident in beautifully crafted cowls, asymmetric pleats, and hand pleats that embellished a collection almost entirely executed in a jersey fabric that Costello and Tagliapietra had developed with their sponsor, Ultrasuede. It wasn't the first time, though, that the designers allowed showtime shenanigans—dour makeup, an aggressive pace, and hands-on-hips posturing, in this case—to distract from the compelling drama of the clothes.</p></div>"
57,fall,2009,f2009,costume-national,"Ennio Capasa conjures his women from some hard-core planet where it's always time for nightclubbing—and the nightclub is the one from a David Lynch movie. For Fall, the fatale of the Costume femme was slightly rough around the edges: red lips; messy, pulled-back hair; and a one-shouldered dress in ruby duchesse satin with ragged seams. There were dresses with halos of trailing Lurex threads, and others haphazardly ruched and suspended from shoulder straps. The phrase ""dragged through a hedge backward"" came to mind—but such is the strange, louche allure of Capasa's work.</p><p>He did, meanwhile, also prove himself quite capable of a certain bandbox smartness, as seen in a gray flannel fingertip jacket over a matching wrapped mini. But it was more the sparkly, scratchy-looking fabric he used for a strapless top or a paper-bag-waist mini that betrayed the true Nationality of Capasa's Costume. Now and forever, he loves a bad girl.</p></div>"
58,fall,2009,f2009,cushnie-et-ochs,"Carly Cushnie and Michelle Ochs continued their exploration of slick and slim body-con dressing in their second runway outing, never straying far from a lean, minimalist silhouette. If it was a bit repetitive, that was likely intentional: The pair said they'd been influenced by concepts of mass production, spurred on by a photo of a German Volkswagen factory. The palette was as sober as an assembly line.</p><p>Standouts included legging-tight pants in a cloud gray marble print that would make a nice substitute for jeans, and an L.B.D. with alternating front-and-back cutouts (also worn by Ochs for her runway bow) that was very Model Off-Duty. Still, among all this sleek efficiency it was the moments of human error that were most interesting, and that make this team one to watch—a single silver-sequined arm, for instance, on an otherwise coal black ensemble.</p></div>"
59,fall,2009,f2009,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley is approaching the recession with a glass-half-full mentality. ""This is a time when you have to be more inventive and resourceful,"" she said before her show. ""Potent creativity springs from instability."" For Fall, the designer put her focus on accessories—including crystal-encrusted legwear, slouchy leather boots, and carved onyx ""wishbone"" necklaces—that can be worn to update a woman's existing wardrobe.</p><p>Believing that shoppers are also in the market for more artisanal wares, Rowley took a craftier approach with the clothing than she has in seasons past. A blouse done up in rows of ribbons, paired with a brocade miniskirt, had an heirloom feel, and a series of sweet silk dresses were patchworked with floral fabrics. While the detailing on some cropped pants felt overly folksy, Rowley's strategy should appeal to her customer come fall.</p></div>"
60,fall,2009,f2009,cynthia-steffe,"Shaun Kearney was looking for a harder edge. How else to explain the surfeit of leather with an inexpensive luster that overwhelmed this collection? Poor fabric choices, plus an abundance of ruching on dresses and skirts, resulted in a less than sophisticated offering. Kearney would have done well to do more with better, more basic fabrics. An oversize mohair sweater looked downright comfy, and a silk-chiffon blouse with a peacock print would pair nicely with a suit. But the few embellished items that did succeed (a knee-length dark gold paillette skirt comes to mind) were mostly lost.</p></div>"
61,fall,2009,f2009,d-g,"In 1954, Maria Callas recorded a memorable version of Bellini's <em>Norma</em> at the Cinema Metropol, the theater where today Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana stage their fashion shows. With the legendary soprano for inspiration, their D&amp;G collection was unapologetically operatic. Bustier dresses with lampshade miniskirts came in brocade, jewel-studded velvet, or tapestry-print chiffon, while a bustier top was paired with high-waisted jeans encrusted with big, colorful crystals. And because every diva needs a cape (a strong theme here in Milan), there was a version in ocelot-print ponyskin and another in gray fur with a collar that looked like chinchilla. The colors—ocher, burgundy, cadet blue, and black—were as lush and rich as the collection's furniture fabrics, but point d'esprit and tulle tutus in pastels worn with T-shirts printed with Callas' image lightened the mix.</p><p>As a foil to the sweetness, the designers threw in some tailcoats with trompe l'oeil frogging and gaiter pants. The models marched down the red-carpeted runway in sky-high platforms with curtain swags in their hair. You could picture some of these clothes finding their way onto the narrow shoulders of young starlets on the premiere circuit. Dolce and Gabbana's message was loud and clear: ""The show must go on.""</p></div>"
62,fall,2009,f2009,danielle-scutt,"It's not fair to thrust an eighties theme on a designer who didn't intend one, but that's what happened to Danielle Scutt after her show. Where others saw something Mugler-esque in the black suit with dramatic red cutout lapels and skirt detail that opened Scutt's show, she saw…prize cockerels. ""The red shape's from the coxcomb they have,"" she insisted, shrugging that the eighties mean little to her: ""I was only born in 1981.""</p><p>Nevertheless, Scutt's woman, with her manipulated feather-print bodysuits and strong shoulders, is an unmistakably feisty bird who is now bent on survival. Scutt said she'd returned to her obsession with decorative poultry breeds—a theme she's explored before—because she wanted to do something intense and condensed in a tough financial season. ""What I like about cockerels,"" she explained, ""is their plumage and their pride. And because I could only do a small show, I started remembering everything you have to do to stand out when you're graduating from Saint Martins: Make the strongest statement you can in a few outfits."" Still, Scutt used her airtime on the runway to prove that she's come a long way from a student mentality in some ways—the dramatic swing-back coat and a re-embroidered printed jersey tunic dress had the hallmarks of a growing sophistication.</p></div>"
63,fall,2009,f2009,daryl-k,"The old was new again at Daryl K. ""I wanted to get back to something really essential: tailored comfort,"" said designer Daryl Kerrigan, standing amid racks in a Soho photographer's studio where she was shooting her lookbook and taking appointments. Fantasy was far from her mind. ""I want to make clothes that are beautiful and that the customer really wants,"" she said. To that end, she kept comfort and practicality top of mind. In anyone else's hands, stretch silk pull-on pants would be an oxymoron; Kerrigan made them sexy as hell. She revisited old favorites and got creative: One versatile tailored topper could be worn as a blouse, cardigan, or jacket. If Kerrigan seemed composed in the midst of turmoil, perhaps it's because she's lived through it before. ""I started my business in a recession,"" she recalled. ""Back then the motto was: 'Stay Alive Until '95.'""</p></div>"
64,fall,2009,f2009,davidelfin,"The best way to understand David Delfin's collection, titled ""Revelations,"" is to know that the designer—who imported his collection from Madrid to New York for Fall—plays a small role in Pedro Almovódar's <em>Broken Embraces</em>. That simple factoid made sudden sense of the show's progression: It opened with strict and lean torero tailoring and closed with proto-fetishwear. A black wool top with floor-sweeping fringe added a touch of the surreal, while the counterpoint of black and white was, at times, almost ecclesiastic (when you averted your eyes from the uncompromising skintight fit and the models' sky-high patent pumps). If the sheer striped pieces looked like they were headed straight to video (cue the steamy music), a group of color-blocked ""Chessy Rayner dresses,"" as one editor called them, were simply elegant. Delfin might have veered rather radically between the tacky and the tasteful, but he has a strong point of view, and that's worth its weight in <em>oro</em>.</p></div>"
65,fall,2009,f2009,dennis-basso,"Dennis Basso's formula for recession dressing could be boiled down to the following: Take some anaconda, add Russian <em>barguzine</em> (mink will do in a pinch), make a coat, and wear it to lunch. Voilà!</p><p>A Manhattan society furrier in the midst of a global economic meltdown is a man in a rather awkward spot, but Basso soldiered on, focusing on daytime furs, mainly fitted jackets and structured coats, to take his customer from coffee to cocktails without raising (too many) eyebrows. While most of his luxe-hybrid outerwear was shown with dresses in silk crepe, one buttery-hued coat of brocade and sable was an outfit in itself. The dresses were mostly forgettable—how could you rip your eyes away from all those skins?—but slim black taffeta cigarette pants commanded a second look, and would work just as well on a downtown girl as on Basso's usual client. Pair those with the sweet biker gloves we spotted, and you just might see Basso on the Bowery. Or not.</p></div>"
66,fall,2009,f2009,derek-lam,"From the first look out, a taupe suede trenchcoat with a big fur stole, it was clear that Derek Lam would be going the give-the-ladies-what-they-want route. There was no reinventing the wheel here, just superluxe versions of the sportswear his girls know and love him for, in a gorgeous warm and soothing palette of beige, gray, camel, and gold, with touches of navy and black. Backstage, Lam said his colors and textures were inspired by Yves Saint Laurent's interiors, and the mood by Louis Malle's 1958 movie, <em>Ascenseur pour l'échafaud</em>, which starred Jeanne Moreau as a wicked film noir heroine. That would explain the preponderance of dramatic outerwear, including a number of furs, most of which were rendered in coyote—good news, girls, that should help to keep the prices down.</p><p>Don't think retro, though. Lam touched on more than a few of what are shaping up to be Fall's key items, including skinny black leather pants, a slightly oversize tuxedo jacket, a cape, and draped and wrapped jersey dresses. One with snaps down the side of the torso looked especially sexy. Unusually, the designer sidestepped big evening dresses, which is usually a strong suit, focusing instead on strapless cocktail frocks in amber georgette and sand-colored crepe de chine. There is such a thing as playing it too safe. Lam's not necessarily guilty of that, but you walked away wanting something more.</p></div>"
67,fall,2009,f2009,devi-kroell,"Accessories darling Devi Kroell returned to Milk Studios to present her second season of ready-to-wear. ""It's for the chic, busy woman,"" said the designer. ""She goes to the office and then she goes out."" Kroell set the jewel-toned collection, fittingly, against a gleaming gold runway. Though she chose a slightly muted palette (in order to avoid ostentation, she explained), color was really the story here, particularly with two belted furs—one a gold vest, the other a teal coat—that immediately grabbed the eye. The same was true for day-to-night silk dresses in ruby, wine, and teal, which borrowed their accordion pleats and origami-esque knots from the traditional dirndl of Kroell's native Austria. The fascinatingly off combination of a gray tuxedo jacket over a forest green shirt and gold pants showed a smart and original color sense. Even more so than Spring, Fall offered a rather uptown brand of chic. It's a look that veers toward preciousness, as in the case of a little chocolate tweed jacket paired with a gold silk skirt, worn with a chain handbag. There was far more energy and news in the terrific wide-leg pants—still sophisticated but with an undertone of rock 'n' roll in the slightly flared leg. Perhaps you call those day-to-night-to-morning.</p></div>"
68,fall,2009,f2009,diane-von-furstenberg,"Sober and serious is one way to respond to the dismal economic outlook, but it's not the Diane von Furstenberg way. Let other designers lay on the black; she dubbed her Fall collection ""Nomad,"" and sent out a melting pot's worth of fabrics, embroideries, and patterns—from leopards to camouflages to tapestry prints. Von Furstenberg is betting that in ""times like these,"" what a girl really wants is a little pizzazz. But comfort counts, too, so accompanying almost all of her wrap dresses, sacks, bubbles, and tunic-miniskirt combos were generous, slouchy cardigans or cocoon coats, as well as knit tights or leggings—some in leather, others in prints that should come in at a very nice price point. Oh, and don't forget the pompom-covered knit hats. Come evening, though, von Furstenberg left cozy behind, and moved into full-on glamour mode, channeling her own Studio 54 days with the show's closing number, a metallic ombré liquid jersey gown, which appeared on the runway as Diana Ross' hit ""Upside Down"" played on the soundtrack. The ageless diva was in the audience and gave von Furstenberg a big hug as the designer made her victory lap.</p></div>"
69,fall,2009,f2009,diesel-black-gold,"The Diesel team looks at any occasion as a potential party (last year's around-the-world bash to launch Diesel TV comes to mind), and on opening day of their largest store—a Fifth Avenue ""mega flagship""—they brought the good times to the Black Gold runway. A trumpeter busting out jazzy renditions of Lou Reed and Nirvana hits set the stage for a collection that may have been inspired by the Roaring Twenties but was mostly an ode to today's street culture.</p><p>The girls played it up in coquettish, lingerie-inspired dresses, lace-up tanks with garter-belt hems, and nubby wool sweaters with faux-corset insets. In one of the final looks, Freja Beha Erichsen worked a number that echoed a factory jumpsuit, but for the open panels that left most of her tattoos on display. The effect was all a bit ""she's come undone""—something it seems the Diesel brand is in no danger of.</p></div>"
70,fall,2009,f2009,dkny,"As tiresome as it's become to view everything through recession-colored glasses, with a smart-priced commercial collection like DKNY, that really is the only appropriate lens. In addition to investing in that one special luxury item this season, the designer customer will want to stretch her dollar like a pair of sample-sale Louboutins.</p><p>With that in mind, Karan and company built Fall on wearable looks pulled together from top to toe—or, more specifically, from funny little felt hat to lace-up spectator bootie, with sleek gloves and a rainbow of oversize envelope clutches and cavernous carryalls in between. Modern, grown-up polish was the name of the game. Pencil skirts ended mid-calf; waists were neatly belted; and trim, boxy coats had bracelet sleeves. Clashing patterns—houndstooths, stripes, a blown-up plaid—kept things from looking too mature or too vintage (though I did find myself idly wondering when the next season of <em>Mad Men</em> is going to begin). Ultimately, this was a true autumn collection, with loads of merch from outerwear to scarves to knits to pants, not all of it skewed to a more soigné lady. Moms and daughters shopping together should take a look: They might finally agree on something.</p></div>"
71,fall,2009,f2009,dolce-gabbana,"No wonder Dolce &amp; Gabbana are in love with Elsa Schiaparelli for Fall. She was an original proponent of the ballooning shoulder (the fashion story of the season), worked her surrealist glamour through tough and weird times, and was an Italian to boot. In an edgy moment, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana used her example to defy all fashion nervousness and lay on a sumptuous show whose production values gave no quarter to the idea that cutbacks and timidity should be the order of the day. Quite the opposite, in fact. The front row was positively teeming with A-listers: Scarlett Johansson, Kate Hudson, Naomi Watts, Freida Pinto, Eva Mendes, and others who had all flown in to view the clothes, and then take in the <em>Extreme Beauty in Vogue</em> exhibition opening that the designers have underwritten at the Palazzo della Ragione.</p><p>The thirties and forties references played through the displaced gloves used as headpieces and scarves, the shell-shaped buttons, the clunky wartime suede platform wedges, the homages to Schiap's shocking pink, and, of course, those huge, puffed-up leg-of-mutton sleeves, rising up in some cases to earlobe level. The spending on luxe materials and a cinematic level of beauty never ceased. Fox, dyed goat hair, mink, and rich brocades were worked into narrow-waisted silhouettes, alternating—though not much—with bell-shaped skirts.</p><p>It might have been a one-message show, but as is always the case with these superconfident designers, there was never any surrender of house identity. Dolce &amp; Gabbana-isms were wittily reiterated when their signature Sicilian corseted and see-through lingerie dresses reappeared, Schiap-shaped, counterpointed by black tuxedo suits. Finally, their traditional ending parade of exaggerated crinolines shifted the look completely to their own territory, with Monroe photo prints spreading over the skirts. Times may be tough, but these are two guys who are not about to give an inch on what they believe in.</p></div>"
72,fall,2009,f2009,donna-karan,"If Donna Karan didn't invent uniform dressing in the eighties, she went a very long way toward making the idea a sexy one. Now, with the economy in a nosedive, she's brought the clever, potentially budget-saving concept back for Fall, and the result is one of her strongest-looking collections in seasons. It starts with a jacket or a draped jersey top—all exaggerated, sculpted shoulders with a wrapped or belted waist. On the bottom, it's either a long, lean skirt or tapered trousers. That powerful, triangular silhouette came down the runway in all sorts of arrangements, each ready to be pulled apart and reconfigured with any number of different pieces. A caramel calfskin trench jacket, a white poplin button-down shirt, or a black silk parka might be paired with a stretchy, below-the-knee jersey skirt, while a portrait-collar alpaca jacket or turtleneck bodysuit might top cropped pants.</p><p>But it wasn't all about separates. Dresses, whether they came long-sleeved or in a drapey goddess style, followed the same commanding lines. Karan only abandoned the bold shoulder to reproduce on the runway a look that she herself has been wearing for years. Made from satin jersey suspended from a necklace of leather-wrapped rings, the halter-style ""cold shoulder"" dress—as she calls it—has been battle-tested not only for sex appeal, but also for ease. Who wouldn't want to slip into a uniform like that?</p></div>"
73,fall,2009,f2009,doo-ri,"Doo-Ri Chung launched her new, lower-priced collection, Under.Ligne, earlier this month. Producing those easy, breezy jersey dresses and T-shirts has had an elevating effect on her main line. Meaning she really let it rip when it came to the details, piling on crystal beading, little touches of fur, chain necklaces, and crystal-studded lace stockings.</p><p>Yes, she dabbled in the draped jersey pieces she built her business on—an elegant dress in the season's must-have shade of violet that dipped low in front and draped languidly to the floor from a knot below the bust was among the best.</p><p>But Chung is becoming just as well known for something we'll call the ""statement shirt,"" a key wardrobe piece in this new age of the omnipresent black legging. The statement might be folding and tucking across the collarbones of a silver silk top so it looks like a cloud is resting on your shoulders. Or it could be a delicate black smoke print on the arm of a white silk blouse, as if your artist friend pulled out a pen and started doodling. As a female designer, she's clued in to those special touches that catch and keep a woman's eye. Do you need another fitted wool blazer? No. What about one with sheer draped jersey sleeves? Why, come to think of it, yes.</p></div>"
74,fall,2009,f2009,douglas-hannant,"Audrey Hepburn in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em> (""the quintessential movie about New York chic,"" Douglas Hannant called it, backstage) was this uptown designer's rather unsurprising muse for Fall. Well-trod ground, surely, but he paid homage with a light touch. Several simple daytime dresses looked like two pieces instead of one; the camel and gray-herringbone shift that opened the show was so subtly constructed it almost fooled the eye. ""If it's going to be elegant, it can't scream,"" Hannant pronounced, and so he kept embellishments few and well judged. A slinky jersey sheath in black had just a dusting of sparkle at the neck, while some pieces' sole moment of drama came from shots of eyelet tulle that exposed the wearer's back. These were wear-forever looks whose clean-lined charm, like Miss Golightly's, won't date anytime soon. A smart investment, in other words, despite the Fifth Avenue price tag.</p></div>"
75,fall,2009,f2009,dries-van-noten,"Many designers seem to be running into difficulty over how to approach women this Fall, dividing their collections schizophrenically between sober-sided sellers and artistic gestures of the sort they hope magazine editors will put on their pages. Dries Van Noten has no such conflicts: He doesn't have to cast about for a ""realistic"" attitude because that, and never made-for-editorial fireworks, is what his business is based on.</p><p>It's given him the authority to respond to the times with a relaxed elegance that many women will identify with. It boils down to simple suggestions: an easy-fitting blazer to slip over a blouse and fluid pants; a draped day dress; a sweater to wear over a long skirt for evening. The show opened and closed with belted camel coats (an item that might turn out to be the sartorial symbol of this recession's sudden shift in aesthetics), but the strange color combinations in between threw off any feeling of dullness. Van Noten had taken the shades of Francis Bacon's paintings—shrimp pink, beige, ocher, orange, and mauve—and deployed them in a way that gave life to pieces that might have seemed boring in other hands.</p><p>While there was nothing overtly retro in it, the undercurrent was of the day-to-day glamour women in Europe and America mustered for themselves while facing the privations of World War II. It was there in the horn-rimmed sunglasses and the Eisenhower jackets, and the template of making the best of oneself in ""good"" simple clothes, with a slash of orange-red lipstick to keep up morale. All that was subtly reinforced by the long, streetlike runway, which was reflected in a two-story-high mirror that gave an angled overhead view, as if from an office-block window: an impression of a legion of city women pressing on with their lives, come what may.</p></div>"
76,fall,2009,f2009,dsquared,"The Dsquared² girls strutted down the catwalk clutching Starbucks venti lattes and Mochaccinos and toting <em>Us Weeklys</em> in their big leather It bags. Jourdan Dunn checked her BlackBerry, peering over the rims of her retro shades, while another model sucked on a cigarette. Show tunes and hair bands vied on the soundtrack. In case it's not clear by now, this collection was all about the high-low mix: T-shirts, preppy pastel button-downs, and boyfriend jeans topped off with a snug washed leather jacket and a trucker hat; a pair of tank tops tucked into a mini made from a Chanel-ish plaid bouclé; or a faded denim jacket tossed on over a black jersey gown with crystal straps. Nearly every look was accessorized with knit caps, sunglasses, and bling.</p><p>Olsen-twins chic is nothing new, of course. It was a while ago that <em>Vogue Italia</em> published a Steven Meisel shoot reproducing paparazzi-style, gossip-rag shots of Mary-Kate, Ashley, and their young Hollywood cohorts—the only difference being that the models were about a foot taller than the celebrities they played. Still, it was a clever bit of fun for Dean and Dan Caten, who, probably not uncoincidentally, just landed a gig designing concert clothes for Britney Spears' upcoming comeback tour (her 15th by our count). The former teen queen—the Catens' program notes spoke of girls interrupted—could really rock the T-shirt dress and crystal-encrusted shirred chiffon jacket Catherine McNeil wore. The funny thing is, this was one of Dsquared²'s most wholesome shows in memory—and none the worse for that.</p></div>"
77,fall,2009,f2009,duro-olowu,"Duro Olowu is never one to use two prints where three or four would do. For Fall, florals jostle with leopard, camouflage clashes with brocade, and metallics rub up against checks. ""How do you wear color in winter?"" he asks. ""You've been into it all summer. Why give it up when it gets chilly?"" For answers, he presented new takes on his signature blowy trapezes, but now cut as shirtdresses in rose-patterned patchworked panels, with a deep flounce. Frills also turned up running along the outside edge of sleeves—an original idea carried over from his last show. For evening, there's a thirties glamour to the contrast piecing, which appears cascading down the front of a chiffon column or puffed into short sleeves. Olowu says the collection has ""an urban folkloric vibe in Technicolor,"" but despite the well-traveled eclecticism, the secret of his success is that these clothes are so easy to wear.</p></div>"
78,fall,2009,f2009,elie-saab,"The Elie Saab show started on a promising note. First he switched up the mise-en-scène, trading in the nightclub-y mirrored runway for a plain, white-planked version more befitting the early hour. Second and more importantly, he put a big emphasis on daywear, specifically forties-esque sheaths in powder gray with topstitching that sculpted ladylike curves into the models' waifish frames. His high-waisted skinny black pants and little bolero jackets with fur and feather detailing were glam, but in a lower key than he usually operates in.</p><p>That clarity of vision faltered a bit when it came to after-dark dressing. Saab has several different markets to satisfy—Hollywood, the Middle East (he's a native of Lebanon), and fashion land—and he trotted out something for each constituency. In order: red-carpet-tested goddess gowns; structured bustier dresses, including a vivid purple number with a single long sleeve; and black crystal-embroidered minidresses and leggings that were almost rock 'n' roll. The evening section could've been cut in half, but even if this show didn't end as strongly as it began, it was still something of a happy surprise from Saab.</p></div>"
79,fall,2009,f2009,elie-tahari,"Elie Tahari can't help but bring a little fun to his designs, and so for Fall even a (relatively) sober tweed jacket and skinny black knit pants were finished off with an embellished obi belt for a wink of shine. You might be headed to the office, the look said, but that doesn't mean you have to be glum.</p><p>Keen on prints, Tahari showed patterns solo and matched every which way—leopard with floral, cherry blossoms on a checkerboard—but the mix was dashed-off enough to make it work. A pair of dresses with open sleeves at the show's end were fitted from the front and billowy from the back; although this is a Fall collection, they begged to be worn near a pool, with a cocktail, stat.</p></div>"
80,fall,2009,f2009,elise-verland,"Shakira wore Elise Øverland's black leather leggings to perform at the Lincoln Memorial concert two days before the inauguration. So it was hardly a surprise to see a surfeit of leather at the designer's Fall presentation; what was exciting were all the ways she found to manipulate and treat it. A soft little blazer in what looked like purple lamé was in fact a spray-painted lambskin. Another jacket, this one boxier, cropped, and trimmed with mirrored paillettes sourced in India, was made from scratched and coated lambskin that had the stiff consistency of much more expensive eel. ""Shimmer"" was the show's theme, inspired, Øverland said, by a book about Japanese sushi given to her by her friend Alexander Rower. The same friend also happened to loan the designer his grandfather Alexander Calder's gold jewelry. Not all of the clothes lived up to the artist's timeless necklaces and crowns; some suffered by comparison. But other numbers, like a little cocktail dress with one studded shoulder strap, were plenty cool all on their own.</p></div>"
81,fall,2009,f2009,emanuel-ungaro,"Third time was the charm. After struggling to connect with the Emanuel Ungaro legacy, Esteban Cortazar has come up with a Fall collection that not only stayed true to the house founder's go-go eighties joie de vivre, but at the same time proved he's keyed in to what the nightclub set likes to wear now. That would be a fits-like-a-glove draped-and-wrapped strapless dress with bold tights and sky-high heels. His little party frocks came every which way: color-blocked in shades of royal blue, orange, and fuchsia; in multicolored polka dots; and beruffled in Ungaro pink and black. Sometimes Cortazar tossed on a stamped black leather motorcycle jacket and a very French silk scarf around the model's neck; other times it was a cropped and cutaway blazer in a menswear plaid.</p><p>On the tailored side, a blue leather jacket and high-waisted satin pants with fanlike pockets on the hips could be contenders for party types who've aged out of microminis. Only the knits—bulky and not nearly as expensive-looking as the price tags will demand—fell flat. Overall, too, the show could've used a tighter edit, but that's something that Cortazar can get the hang of now that he's figured out his raison d'être.</p></div>"
82,fall,2009,f2009,emilio-pucci,"Peter Dundas is the new man at Emilio Pucci, charged with making the iconic Florence-based label and its famous prints relevant for a new generation. The Norwegian designer, who also helms the French fur house Revillon, is perhaps best known for his stint at Emanuel Ungaro. There he made fans of the young Hollywood crowd with his body-conscious, boldly colorful sensibility (did we mention he once worked for Roberto Cavalli?). Today's debut collection for Pucci was very much in that sexy spirit.</p><p>The show opened with canvas military coats and jackets lined lavishly in fox fur, worn with short dresses and over-the-knee suede pirate boots or second-skin python pants. They signaled the low-high mix that defined Dundas' approach to the season. The designer carried it through even into evening, where a strapless minidress was patchworked together from faded denim and guipure lace in a swirling pattern that subtly evoked one of the house's prints.</p><p>The lack of overt Pucci references—the kind that dependably evoke the label's Capri-in-the-sixties origins—was striking. But the prints Dundas did resurrect (from a 1957 collection dubbed ""Palio"" after Siena's centuries-old horse race) looked fresh on slouchy cashmere long-sleeved T-shirts worn with supertight back-zip jeans. With friends like the Crown Princess of Norway, Mette-Marit, sitting in his front row, Dundas is well positioned to observe the changing lifestyles of the international jet set. Keying into the fact that these days young aristos want to look like rock stars appears to have given him a way to make Pucci timely again.</p></div>"
83,fall,2009,f2009,emporio-armani,"Just over a week ago, Giorgio Armani opened a sweeping three-story flagship to house all of his labels under one roof on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was the party of fashion week—with a celebrity contingent that included Leonardo DiCaprio and Victoria Beckham, the glow of flashbulbs popping could be seen for blocks. Today, though, Armani set aside grown-up glamour for a moment, sending out an Emporio collection that had a much more youthful, sometimes schoolgirl-ish feel. That was due not only to the styling—sheer kneesocks accompanied nearly every look—but also to the silhouette. In place of the artful and quirky pants the designer is so fond of, there were pleated shorts for day and evening, along with a fair number of shorter skirts and baby-doll dresses.</p><p>That's not to say Armani ignored the many Emporio customers who no longer qualify as ingenues. His show had jackets and coats to tempt them. He started with a zip-front, collarless trench (though that's as masculine as things got). A pair of fitted jackets in soft, washed leather with ruffles at the collar stood out, but bouclé tweeds and velvets also made the lineup, as did knit cardigan-style toppers. What was seductive about those was their drape, the way they hugged the lines of the shoulders and torso without clinging. This something-for-everyone collection means Armani's new store on Fifth Avenue just might be an ideal mother-daughter shopping spot.</p></div>"
84,fall,2009,f2009,erdem,"Intense focus on individual creativity and quality of execution are the driving forces behind this season's London shows. They've propelled Erdem Moralioglu into a place where he could almost be called the Christian Lacroix of London: a super-decorator and colorist who commands print and embroideries in ways that surpass expectations—especially those of someone who is based in the East End. For Fall, Moralioglu's silhouettes were mostly variations on a theme: a short, doll-like, Empire line with a puffed-up skirt. It was a step away from his waftily romantic Summer collection: ""I thought, She's not running free and romantic in the meadows this season,"" he said. ""Now she's visited nightclubs and gone home on the bus."" Still, it was hard to see followers of Erdem being less than entranced with the surface details—cutout black lace applied dramatically to red duchesse satin, and stylized red, purple, and black chrysanthemums or tiny yellow violas embroidered by a fellow Royal College of Art alumnus who lives in Brighton and happens to have something approaching the interpretive techniques of Lesage. If all this sounds grandiose and pretentious, the saving grace was that it was all designed within the sphere of a young girl's mentality. Toward the end, though, there was a passage of long, slim dresses with long sleeves strong enough to make several grown-up women in the audience take notice.</p></div>"
85,fall,2009,f2009,erin-fetherston,"Tonight's collection was, in Erin Fetherston's own estimation, her ""most graphic to date."" Gone were the floaty princess dresses of seasons past, and in their place were a number of tailored toppers—little tweed peplum jackets and Empire-waisted jacquard riding coats—paired with skinny wool trousers. These looks were inspired by <em>The Nutracker</em>'s tin soldiers and other tales of toys springing to life (after all, it wouldn't be a Fetherston show without a dose of whimsy).</p><p>This designer is at her strongest when she reins in the preciousness. A lambskin swing skirt, part of her first foray into leather, and a black tuxedo jumpsuit with plunging neckline had real chic. Barring a too-long series of polka-dot tulle party dresses, Fetherston pushed herself—successfully—to offer more than her standard fare.</p></div>"
86,fall,2009,f2009,etro,"Somewhere in the processing of material for her collections, Veronica Etro always manages to excavate a timely East-West connection that reflects the culturally eclectic heritage of her family company. This time, she said she was looking to Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire, whose treasures happen to have just been on display at the Royal Academy of Arts in London.</p><p>That meant she could find her own way to weave the season's burnished golds, bronzes, and copper into her show. It also led her to detail neckpieces and belts to evoke the feathers of the angel wings seen in Byzantine icons, and to design spice-tinted prints derived, perhaps, from the patterns of Turkish carpets. Not that you needed a degree in art history to understand what was on show. In truth, Etro has settled into a sensible groove of accessible daywear, one that accommodates house signatures like the paisley coat, edged in gilded leather, as well as specialties like the flowy, halter-neck scarf dresses presented for evening. The gilt-edged suede shoes and the gold-and-fringed bags might pique the interest of a cherry-picking fashion shopper for fall, but mostly Etro has steered the company's designs toward steady middle-of-the-road fare—a safe port in a storm, perhaps, for a company with a following of people who don't care too much about transient trend agendas.</p></div>"
87,fall,2009,f2009,fendi,"With their towering vertical, square-shouldered demeanor, Fendi's women looked like an elegant army of survivors who might have walked through an apocalypse and out the other side. Their clothes, mostly dark, were cut with narrow flying panels, oddly textured with what looked at a glance like worn-through or dust-spattered fabrics and frayed edges. Of course, it wasn't that at all. Close up, the raw threads were minute dustings of mohair or fur, and the semi-destroyed materials proved to be advanced treatments of cashmere, burned-out chiffon, and flannel. Somewhere in designing this collection, Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi arrived at a dynamic balance between confronting the current mood and creating a modern proposition for that problematic word <em>luxury</em>.</p><p>Experience and technical expertise count here. Lagerfeld, after all, has navigated Fendi through many periods of Sturm und Drang when showy luxury has fallen out of favor, and he knows how to calibrate a response. Some of the devices used this season—like a fur cut to look like a shearling flying jacket—use disguise as a tactic. Yet Lagerfeld also knows this is no moment to fall back on grungy <em>poverino</em> styling. If women are going to be persuaded to buy, there has to be a compelling reason. His way is to infiltrate innovation into the mix: a strong silhouette with a subtle undercurrent of glamour. The furs, of course, are as extraordinary as ever—technical feats that merge sable and fox, or use technology to make white gold cling to mink. On the other hand, this collection has moved far beyond being a mere foil for Fendi's craft skill as a furrier. Its fashion appeal as a ready-to-wear collection is now so clear, its reach has gone well beyond the core product.</p></div>"
88,fall,2009,f2009,salvatore-ferragamo,"Cristina Ortiz has had a tough go of it so far at Salvatore Ferragamo, her first two collections turning out more louche than ladylike. Happily, her third effort is much more polished and cultivated. Credit goes mostly to the tailoring: vaguely forties-ish jackets with hunched shoulders and diagonally cropped bell sleeves worn with pencil skirts or tapered and cropped trousers. One great-looking red dress with a high neck and an accent on the waist demonstrated that she's quite handy at sophisticated draping, too. Also in the plus column was her restrained approach to accessorizing, with fewer handbags making the runway.</p><p>Toward the end, though, Ortiz couldn't resist flashing some skin. She gets a pass for the dresses with sculptural, plunging necklines—more or less in keeping with the general sensibility of the collection—but not for the sheer sweaters. These were ill-considered bits of frivolousness that did nothing but distract from the perfectly elegant long skirts with which they were paired.</p></div>"
89,fall,2009,f2009,francesco-scognamiglio,"A rumor that Alice Dellal would be taking a turn on Francesco Scognamiglio's catwalk raised the buzz level there today. In the end she was a no-show, but the new faces drawn into the crowd were treated to the designer's most retail-ready collection yet. The curious got an eyeful of his tailoring chops and flair for the dramatic blouse (this season with ruffs running down the sleeves), while his followers got an eye-opener: Scognamiglio can really do knits. A black sweater dress laminated with gold had a vintage quality that made it the lineup's most interesting piece.</p><p>In the not so distant past, Scognamiglio has been guilty of rhinestone-studded latex and see-through plastic pants. This time, a few sheer tops aside, he restricted his more outrageous impulses to the accessories. Heavy gold-studded boots that gave the models a hard time earned him a demerit, while Philip Treacy's absolutely towering gendarme and hussar hats earned him a gold star. This label's profile is likely to continue on the uptick.</p></div>"
90,fall,2009,f2009,g-star,"With two pianists behind a semitransparent screen providing the live soundtrack for G-Star's Fall show at the Hammerstein Ballroom, models in dropped-crotch jeans and zipper-covered tops marched their way down, off, and around the runway. The look was tough and a little postapocalyptic. Collars were oversize and upturned, as if to protect these night owls from something sinister around the bend; coats, meanwhile, seemed ready to double as parachutes or flotation devices. Maybe we're reading too much into it, but there did seem to be less of the usual exuberance we've come to expect from a G-Star show. The appearance of Benicio Del Toro, who did a reading of Joy Division's ""Candidate"" at the show's close, was something of a head-scratcher, but an impressive celebrity wild card nonetheless.</p></div>"
91,fall,2009,f2009,gap,"High fashion has had its say, but what of the democratic point of view for Fall? According to Gap's Patrick Robinson, it's going to be ""about people walking into the store and eyeing things they think might be three times the price of what they'd expect to see, but then finding out they're a fourth of what they thought."" To wit: black, curly shearling jackets and vests; a cute knit-sleeved toggle-fastened peacoat; a dark indigo denim trench; and a super-desirable pair of high, chunky-heeled sheepskin Pierre Hardy boots, among much else. All these were lined up on a podium—a casual style of presenting Robinson has made a Gap signature over three seasons—only this time, the location was the old flower market Covent Garden in London, not New York.</p><p>Why? Gap has deep American roots, but the brand is now designed by internationally minded U.S., European, and Japanese teams that Robinson directs out of New York, and this is the first stage of a new Gap road-show strategy demonstrating their joined-up thinking. (Next stop, for Spring 2010, will be Tokyo.) Mostly, Robinson says, they're thinking about layered sportswear with a smarter edge and exacting proportions. The classic pocket tee has been rethought in drapey washed silk; a new chino comes cut with a skinny stovepipe leg, ""so it can also be rolled up and worn with a high sandal""; and the ombré-dyed twinset knits have been elongated to look right over leggings. And where denim appeared, it had obviously been more influenced by the European collaboration between Lanvin and Acne (all tailored, deep-indigo dyed pieces) than traditional western workwear. Not to say there weren't familiar Gap moments—comfortable brown-toned Navajo knits for holiday, for starters.</p><p>If there's a criticism, the collection could have used more color, along the lines of the single cornflower blue silk top that stood out in the mix. True, the rest of fashion has toned itself down to shades of gray and black, so these looks will fit right in with the season's agendas. But a tiny shot of trend-bucking American optimism wouldn't have gone amiss.</p></div>"
92,fall,2009,f2009,gareth-pugh,"The invitation—a black-and-white photo of boiling clouds—cued the elemental spirit of Gareth Pugh's new collection. Aware of how often he's been stuck in a sci-fi box, the designer stressed, ""This is not from a spaceship, it's from under the ground. I wanted it to feel earthy."" If the palette—black, gray, and hematite, the color of oxidized iron—was of this earth, it was definitely somewhere way down inside. Matthew Stone's soundtrack, which used a piece of the Krzysztof Penderecki music from <em>The Shining</em>, compounded the mines-of-Mordor mood.</p><p>Pugh presented his new looks in mesmerizing video form. And in that context, his clothes made perfect sense in a way that they haven't always on the runway. While the 2-D format meant it took a visit to the showroom to appreciate the texture of Pinhead outfits carpeted with fine spikes like a lethal fur, it did allow for a chance to see the clothes in movement, whipped into aerodynamic shapes on screen by an elemental wind. The designer's new silhouette—falling away in a pleated-back A-line from a small shoulder—was the direct inverse of the triangular shape that made his name. It gave a swirling, capelike volume to coats and jackets. The new trouser shape—high-waisted, with a full pant that covered Pugh's platformed footwear—also amplified the volume moving around the body. (The shoes themselves looked like snub-snouted devil dogs; they almost seemed to be grinning evilly.)</p><p>Otherwise, the collection followed on very closely from the menswear Pugh showed in January (he is also selling those clothes in women's sizes). That was particularly apparent in detailing like the triangles that patterned an ornately worked mink jacket or the hooded, pointed-hem leather coat that is his signature piece. When other designers imagine a complementary couple in their collections for men and women, it's usually as boyfriend and girlfriend. Pugh sees a brother and sister in his clothes, siblings ruling his tragic kingdom. There's something appropriately Jacobean about such a notion as it applies to fashion's most theatrically dark designer.</p></div>"
93,fall,2009,f2009,giambattista-valli,"Giambattista Valli presented a very individual picture of dignified modern elegance on his runway. It was, he said, inspired ""by Yves Saint Laurent—but more his lifestyle than his fashion."" Pared down and graceful, it was drawn around simple silhouettes that struck a quiet balance between sobriety and luxe, a palate-cleanser of a show that stepped away from Valli's previous seasons of dressy extravagance.</p><p>The first point of difference was in the length. Though it opened with a short orange swing coat, the distinctive mark of the collection emerged via the ankle-grazing, almost monastic proportions that followed. In a season when there's been too much ultra-short on the runways, it was a brave yet wholly refreshing move, providing a plethora of gorgeous double-faced coats and neat cropped jackets with exaggerated sleeves, paired with narrow skirts that had a gentle volume gathered into the waist.</p><p>Saint Laurent's influence was certainly there, though deployed in ways that never strayed into heavy-handed homage. There were hints of the Russian collection in the plaited and tasseled silk belts and the glowing metallic brocades, but the strongest looks were those where the designer removed all decoration and downplayed color to allow the skill of his cutting to speak for itself. Spare, draped dresses in matte navy, teal, or maroon looked truly sophisticated, carrying the hallmarks of Valli's appeal to women who move in the upper echelons of international aristocracy (one gown came wrapped in a mohair djellaba cloak that could have been designed with his most high-profile client, Queen Rania of Jordan, in mind). These days, even the wealthy are eschewing the flashy and unnecessary in fashion, a change in mood Valli has clearly comprehended. This collection brought out his underlying strengths as a designer who understands how soft architecture and social tact can work beautifully together.</p></div>"
94,fall,2009,f2009,gianfranco-ferre,"A question mark lingered over Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi's second Gianfranco Ferré show. The label's parent company, IT Holding SpA, declared bankruptcy earlier this week, and it's not entirely certain that this collection will actually go into production. That's a shame, because the designers have demonstrated not only an appreciation for Ferré's legacy, but also an ability to finesse the trends. They evoked the late ""architect of fashion"" with a white off-the-shoulder blouse with a very prominent bow, but mostly focused on today's currents, channeling the eighties by way of Queen Elizabeth I. ""It is a very positive association for us,"" said Rimondi of this season's most popular decade to reference. ""It's when we were young."" As for the ruffs? Simple: ""We loved the Cate Blanchett movie.""</p><p>They opened with a pagoda-shouldered coat with seams lined in tiny, burnished gold studs and a stand-up Elizabethan collar. A peak-shouldered jacket, jumpsuit, and dress, all in black, intermingled with the pagodas—but it wasn't just a silhouette story they were telling. Aquilano and Rimondi have an eye for texture. A pair of jackets combined bouclé, cashmere, and alpaca for a genius moiré effect. Sometimes things did get clunky. Tape and paillette embroidery weighed down one lean skirt, and a few bubble dresses nearly suffocated the willowy models. But an evening dress in bottle-green velvet, crepe marocain, and duchesse satin was as chic as anything that's come down the runway this season. Whatever happens to the house of Ferré, these two have a long future ahead of them.</p></div>"
95,fall,2009,f2009,giles-deacon,"An unidentified, aggressive raw noise greeted the audience at Giles Deacon's show, a scene-setter for a collection that was obviously intended to shake up the normal order of predictable runway behavior. The show started with eighties supermodel Rachel Williams in a gray flannel bustier dress with shearling gauntlets, threateningly clutching chains in her fists—a sign that something feistier than usual was going on, though quite what only became clear once Deacon had his say at the end. ""I just thought I wanted to go back to what got me into fashion in the first place,"" he said. ""I graduated from Central Saint Martins in 1992 and I wanted to recapture all of the fun we had playing with things in those days. So the collection is a revisiting of all the things of my own that I've liked—and hopefully an improvement on them."" The women walking for Deacon were a mixture of former fashion heroines and street-cast locals from Camden. Not that anyone really looked that rough and angry—this is a show where Katie Grand's styling always lends international polish. As for clothes, the sequence of Deacon's favorite moments would only be really legible to his nearest and dearest. Few others would realize that the circular leather skirt came from his graduate show, or that the fly-fishing printed dress hooked onto the fact that the other side of Deacon is a country-loving boy from Cumbria, or that the giant knits at the end were a reprise of something he did 18 months ago. It was, in other words, a random affair, and a somewhat puzzling exercise in solipsism for anyone who expects fashion to move relentlessly onward.</p></div>"
96,fall,2009,f2009,giorgio-armani,"""Aesthetics and shapes have been chosen to update the somewhat theatrical impact of eighties-style fashion,"" read Giorgio Armani's program notes. Fashion is obsessed all over again with that decade, and who better to revisit the era than the man who put his own stamp on it? Armani recaptured the power-woman vibe of the time via patent leather berets and gloves, wide belts, fire-engine red lips, and a soundtrack that featured a Grace Jones tune and a medley of Tina Turner hits.</p><p>There was nothing really retro about this show, though—aside from the very old-school turns the designer's models made halfway down the runway, the better to show off his swingy knit capes. Peel away the accessories and the makeup, and what remained was the soft tailoring and sparkly evening looks Armani has never stopped doing. Jackets were cut slim, smart, and fitted. The best of the bunch came sans lapels, with a single button in front and a little flare in back, although a silver crocodile stamped leather number was also an eye-catcher. The leggings-tight, slightly cropped trousers may be too unforgiving for many customers, but there were also inverted-pleat tulip skirts worn with opaque black tights.</p><p>At the Oscars, Armani demonstrated his range, dressing both Sophia Loren and Anne Hathaway. The crystal-studded flat satin boots he showed here won't make it from the runway to the red carpet, but the bejeweled slipdresses and one-shoulder looks in shades of gray are a convincing argument that, whatever the decade, this designer knows how to work a winning formula.</p></div>"
97,fall,2009,f2009,givenchy,"Riccardo Tisci was giving quotes backstage. ""It was Schiaparelli, animal sensuality, the forties, the thirties,"" he began, and then pulled himself up with a more cogent submission: ""Actually, I wanted to show lots of different shapes for all kinds of women."" That last comment made sense. What had transpired on the Givenchy runway in the preceding 20 minutes was, at least in part, a corrective response to the criticism of his last ""Western Bondage"" collection, which was deemed to be only wearable by the super-skinniest of the fashion brave. In this collection, there were ample representations of Tisci's breadth of appeal: suits, coats, tailored dresses, well-cut pants. Yet there were many other parts as well—fierce, chic one-sleeved spiral-cut dresses with fur implants in the shoulder pads; feathers and goat hair embroidered onto tulle; signature Tisci-esque moments of fetish-y leather and goth mermaid; studs on white leather…and so it went on.</p><p>If the sheer variety of it all militated against any impression of wholeness, some of the parts were often very good indeed. A passage of palest lemon-beige yielded three interesting short lace dresses with blue glitter shoulder pads peeking through, bookended by two immensely chic pantsuits with matching ostrich boas. Lily Donaldson got to trot around in an enviably modern white asymmetric evening T-shirt, looped about with ropes and feathers, over slouchy black pants. And then, not quite ultimately, came three white fantasy goddess dresses, fabulously draped with glamorous demi-stoles of 3-D plissé fans and ostrich nestled into the neck and shoulder. Their beauty and modernity demonstrated beyond doubt that Tisci has taken much from his experience with Givenchy's couture. Yet perhaps things have now reached the stage where the guy doesn't need to keep trying so hard to prove himself: We believe him. It would actually have shown more self-confidence if he'd whittled his catalog of accomplishments down by a third.</p></div>"
98,fall,2009,f2009,graeme-black,"One of the incidental pleasures of London fashion week is its occasional surprise-sightseeing opportunities. It's not every day, after all, that the fashion crowd finds itself invited to sit on gold chairs in Spencer House, once the city abode of an ancestor of Diana, Princess of Wales, and now owned by Jacob Rothschild. Suffice it to say that the breathtaking eighteenth-century decor conclusively puts the Windsors' Buckingham Palace in the shade.</p><p>The setting tells you all you need to know about the in Graeme Black has among a certain breed of private-minded clients, the kind who quite obviously are at the furthest possible remove from the regular youth-driven, raw-edged shenanigans of the London shows. As an ex-assistant of Giorgio Armani, Black is to London what Ralph Rucci is to New York: someone who applies his own convictions to design in luxe fabric and conceptual decoration without much troubling to fall in with the external flow of trend. This season, he said his collection evolved from ""taking the wrong turn"" at the London Natural History Museum and ending up in the mineral room. That detour prompted curviform shapes, marbled prints, and internal textures vaguely suggesting crystals. The silhouettes—basically Poiret wraps over short, fitted dresses—didn't vary much, and might prove awkward for anyone with less-than-perfect legs. It looked better when he relaxed the structure in a softer bouclé knit coat or threw in a metallic sequined blazer or stepped up the sense of occasion with a white feathered cocktail dress. There's a sense that Black's is a world isolated and—who knows?—even insulated from any of the realities that motivate most women to buy.</p></div>"
99,fall,2009,f2009,gucci,"Frida Giannini's populist approach to Gucci has the ability to divide opinion between girls all over the world who see nothing wrong with buying into her accessible channeling of trends, and critics who wish for something more directional at this level of luxe. Still, in these extreme times, maybe that's splitting hairs. When a designer sees her market, it would be insanity not to go for it, and in Giannini's case, that means aiming at nightclubbing girls who might be tempted by a glittery upgrade on the slick-leather leg and big-top look all urban teenagers are rocking this year.</p><p>The legwear was either a case of black skintight thigh-high boots disappearing into the hemline of tunic tops, or leggings patchworked in suede, leather, and patent coming down in the opposite direction to cover the foot (often it was hard to tell which was which). The top halves were either kimono T-shirts or, for evening, tiny, drapey iridescent-crystal mesh dresses (inspired by Tina Chow, according to program notes). With the slicked-back hair, crimson lips, and mirrored shades, it was hard glamour for hard times, with the occasional half glance back at Tom Ford's heyday in a blue fox chubby or a skimpy one-shoulder black jersey dress with a slice of patent in the neck.</p><p>Giannini's personal imprint, repeated many times throughout the show, is the ""Frida"" pantsuit, which she introduced as a boyish balancer for all the glam gowns in her first collection. Now it has acquired bigger shoulders and a relaxed-hip, skinny-leg trouser fit, and, given its many representations in fabric options running from <em>changeant</em>-shot silk to jacquard to silver sequin to metallic leopard spot, it must be vindicating itself as a house best seller. For which, well done. Still, Giannini's insistence on hammering it home in all those exhaustive options is one of the things about her commercial style of showing that makes a crowd of critics mentally drum its fingers with impatience.</p></div>"
100,fall,2009,f2009,haider-ackermann,"A bigger venue, a more convenient time slot, important faces in the crowd—has Haider Ackermann finally arrived? The beautiful collection he showed today certainly suggests he deserves every bit of the newfound attention.</p><p>The designer has developed something of a cult following for the seductive way he can wrap and drape a long dress and construct the tiniest, supplest leather jackets around. Both of these signatures returned for Fall, the former in a thicker knit with asymmetric shoulder lines, bare expanses of back, and a daring hip-high slit up one leg. The latter came in bold-for-Ackermann shades of ruby and violet, as well as in burnished gold sequins.</p><p>Where this collection upped the ante was with new embroideries and an assured hand for mannish tailoring. ""She's coming from nowhere and brings her treasures with her,"" Ackermann said of his muse, adding that ""she's not androgynous, but there's that side to her and she's trying to bring it out."" A racerback tank with a ravaged, uneven hem was embellished all over with silver flower embroideries that reappeared as tuxedo stripes down the sides of slouchy, tapered pants. A long, silver-fringed scarf worn with one of his floor-length, bias-cut silk skirts did double duty as a top. On the more masculine side, he showed the season's oversize blazer in washed brown silk and a pajama set in purple satin. Still, it's his little jackets that set the heart thumping. The best, a corseted cutaway tailcoat in cranberry, worn with a long silk-satin skirt with a train, could increase Ackermann's reach still further: It would make an inspired red-carpet choice for a lithe Hollywood type with an adventurous spirit.</p></div>"
101,fall,2009,f2009,halston,"Fashion actually doesn't exist in a vacuum—that, at least, has finally been proven once and for all by designers' obsession with the economy these days. Clothing doesn't mean anything without context. And context is exactly what has been missing at Halston, which was relaunched for the umpteenth time in February of last year and has been designed by a team for two seasons.</p><p>Instead of a runway show, the creative forces at the house produced a video in which model Dree Hemingway—yes, daughter of Mariel, who burst into stardom in the original disco-Halston heyday of the late seventies—rushes headlong toward some destination unknown (or, as the program solemnly put it, ""moves through the film's interior world created by director Nez Khammel"").</p><p>Back in the showroom, the brightly hued garments themselves looked cheerful enough. (Studded jumpsuit, anyone?) A floor-length sequined coat was chic, and there were some beautiful details, including scarf ties that would have charmed Isadora Duncan and a gently caped back on a primary-red minidress. Some of the trendiest looks will probably be picked up by L.A. stylists and photographed for the tabloids because Halston has a certain cool cred in Hollywood again. But here in Manhattan, where Studio 54 feels as far away as ancient Rome, they just don't match the mood.</p></div>"
102,fall,2009,f2009,helmut-lang,"You will find Helmut Lang on Saks Fifth Avenue's new contemporary floor, but you won't find its designers, Nicole and Michael Colovos, on the party circuit. ""We don't go out very much; we stay focused on our work,"" the duo said as they presented their Fall collection in their clean white studio. The clothes belied the Colovos' alleged homebody status. For starters, the designers took color inspiration from Marlene Dumas, the South African painter whose work was recently seen at MoMA. There were also on-trend pieces such as distressed denims (recalling the couple's personal and professional grunge phases), zippers galore, and plenty of cocoon-y toppers. These looks would cut a figure whether you're out on the town or staying closer to home.</p></div>"
103,fall,2009,f2009,hermes,"A full squadron of female flying aces took off at Hermès. There were multiple propellers turning in the background, accompanied by soundtracks from <em>Casablanca</em>, etc., etc.—just in case some dullard in the house (or rather, the inhospitable concrete warehouse) didn't immediately get the meaning of the Amelia Earhart/Amy Johnson headgear and bomber jackets.</p><p>Jean Paul Gaultier's old-school pun mania can be trying at times, but on this occasion he, well, winged it with aplomb. It's a season of leather, after all, and since Hermès is the ultimate seat of luxurious skins and superb tooling, the conceit gave full vent to the house expertise. There were fur-collared crocodile bombers, leather jumpsuits, and mink-lined gilets. These were mixed with flannel pants, gray tunic knits (some patched with astrakhan), super-slim leg-hugging suede boots, and matte gray Kelly bags.</p><p>Women in uniform is another aspect of the forties mood that's floating around this Fall, so the spirit of Gaultier's show cross-referenced knowingly with the mainstream flow of fashion. In truth, though, Hermès' appeal is most persuasive when the styling is at its furthest distance from seasonal trendiness. That's especially the case in an era when such costly purchases should come with a lifetime guarantee of utility. Thus, a gray-flannel toggle coat with a generous hood (zippered like an MA-1) stood out over the more obvious crocodile status symbols. And for evening it was a black, bias-cut satin dress that carried the sort of classic grace and subtlety that should have Carla Bruni-Sarkozy placing an order pronto.</p></div>"
104,fall,2009,f2009,herve-leger-by-max-azria,"Max Azria apparently picked a winner when he bought Hervé Léger in 1998. Wearing one of the house's bandage dresses has become a rite of passage for young actresses—like Joy Bryant, January Jones, and Michelle Trachtenberg, who attracted the paparazzi to today's show. That's some ROI (return on investment).</p><p>Azria and his wife, Lubov, aren't trying to refashion the house; they've stuck by that bankable dress, which means the show is mostly about novel embellishments. For Fall the designers wanted to move to ""the beat of an urban tribe,"" so they chose a muted Saharan palette and successfully played with texture through weaving and insets of exotic skins. The Azrias also experimented with the built-out shoulder this season. That created an interesting contrast to the hourglass silhouette, but also unavoidably recalled Balmain's Spring 2009 ""Frankenstein"" look. More original was a soft chiffon snakeskin-print dress with center-front braiding detail, and a knockout crystal-beaded number worn by Anna Selezneva, which deserved the applause the starlets gave it.</p></div>"
105,fall,2009,f2009,house-of-holland,"Henry Holland and Aggy Deyn have turned the gossamer web of media celebrity into the safety net of a substantial career. (Their friends the Misshapes, who provided the music for the House of Holland show, are a transatlantic parallel.) The problem with that kind of success is that it's almost always the triumph of style over substance. I can't imagine Holland cares. To the most partisan crowd of London fashion week, who shrieked with glee at every passage, he offered up a full-tilt paean to Pantone. So Aggy was on first in a jacket, skinny pants, tights, and shoes, each item striped with different tones of green banded with white. Then came purple, pink, turquoise, and on and on. It was a fresh, graphic idea and it was best at its simplest, when Holland paraded his color schemes in a green sweatshirt dress, a jersey tee, or a cashmere leotard. He got into trouble when he tried ""fashion"" on for size, especially because it was another trip to that flashy corner of the eighties that we've already visited too often this season. Deyn's jacket had a boxy pagoda shoulder, for instance. There were wings of fabric on a skirt and a pair of baggy, pleated pants. God only knows which decade the Tibetan lamb ""bustle"" on a wool skirt reared up from. On the other hand, that same shaggy beast totally rocked out in a coat of graduated black, white, and gray. Call it a winsome lose-some situation.</p></div>"
106,fall,2009,f2009,hutson,"The past several months have been something of a roller coaster for Swaim and Christina Hutson. First there was the giddy high of being CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalists for their lines Obedient Sons and Daughters; then there was the low of losing an investor and having to hit restart on a business that had been gathering momentum and recognition. But the husband-and-wife pair appears to have found strength in adversity, showing their new and refocused incarnation, now simply named Hutson, in a small presentation at the Bowery Hotel.</p><p>Last season their womenswear line, Daughters, had begun to move away from its roots in his-and-her suiting with more dresses, knits, and softer separates among the masculine/feminine fare. With Hutson, the team intends to widen that gender divide. For Fall they used more substantial fabrications and stiffer constructions than they had for Spring, like a boiled wool stiffened with a canvas lining and a thick croc-stamped leather that Christina described as ""armored versions"" of the thirties looks that had been their inspiration. Though quite beautifully executed and perfect for a picture, such strict pieces may not be an easy sell. More likely to make it on the sales floor were Poiret-esque coats in faux fur or a microfiber that approximated feathers. The suit was still here in various forms, from a back-zipped mohair jacket and little shorts that pushed the limits of the form to a more traditional boxy angora jacket with wide-cropped pants. The Hutsons are top tailors, so it's natural that their suiting will draw the most attention. But they have respectably moved out of their comfort zone, and might just be headed back up to the top of the hill.</p></div>"
107,fall,2009,f2009,iceberg,"Iceberg's Paolo Gerani can be counted on to nail the trends. Volume, fur, chunky knits, neons—he had them all, plus the season's glossy red lips for good measure. But wearability too often seemed like an afterthought at his Fall show. A hot pink heavy-gauge cable-knit sweater topping a black python-stamped stretchy skirt is one thing, but a strapless dress made of the stuff isn't likely to go over with this collection's target audience of lithe young party types—can you picture dancing in the thing?</p><p>What worked were the more body-conscious looks, like a purple jersey number inset at the waist with an hourglass-enhancing panel of black quilting. The Robert Indiana <em>LOVE</em> sculpture intarsia sweater dresses, meanwhile, made a clever follow-up to last season's Jeff Koons prints. They were a sweet reprieve from the show's aggressive styling.</p></div>"
108,fall,2009,f2009,io-ipse-idem,"After losing the rights to his name, Romeo Gigli has found new backers in IP SpA and returned to the runway for the first time in several seasons with a line named Io Ipse Idem. ""Going around the world looking at women, I see that they need new shapes. What I see more or less looks the same,"" the designer said, adding that a guiding principle of the new collection is that it looks structured but isn't.</p><p>What appeared to be a straightforward men's jacket from the front was softly cocooned in the back. Few of Gigli's jackets, in fact, hit the catwalk without some sort of special treatment: A blazer came with a starburst cutout between the shoulder blades; a silk velvet evening coat fastened two different ways. There were some intriguing notions, of the sort that explain the goodwill that the designer has maintained in his absence: The skirts, in both pencil and flaring silhouettes, came ruched and elasticized, so they not only travel well, but also accommodate all sizes. But if Gigli really wants to appear modern, he should advise the models to skip the runway theatrics next time.</p></div>"
109,fall,2009,f2009,iris-van-herpen,"Though she is considered one of fashion’s most forward-thinking designers, for her 10-piece Fall 2009 show, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2017-couture/iris-van-herpen#all-seasons"">Iris van Herpen</a> looked back in time to Egyptian mummification. Her attraction was twofold: the elaborate craft techniques (swaddling, wrapping, et cetera) and her observation that these ancient people “tried to ‘create’ reality through their art forms,” believing that existence on earth was an illusion and perfection would be achieved in the afterlife.</p><p>On the runway, models wore painstakingly and elaborately hand-worked looks made of ECCO leathers and suedes that were laced and ruffled, pierced with eyelets, and studded with innumerable metal balls. Van Herpen dug deep for her concept and gave a new spin to age-old techniques, but the styling references were more contemporary, nodding to punk and bondage.</p></div>"
110,fall,2009,f2009,isaac-mizrahi,"Isaac Mizrahi titled his Fall show ""Smile"" and sent looks with names like Cosy, Xanaxer, and Stressless Dress down the runway to an original jazz score by the Bad Plus. Accessorized with Schiaparelli-referencing handbag hats, models paraded out in plaid kilts and sarongs, chunky knits, and gowns (some with truly odd exposed underpinnings). There were also big blanket-y comfort coats, worn with ""I'm just running out to get some milk"" fur-trimmed slippers, as well as some eye-popping tinsel looks that are guaranteed to take one's mind off the economy. This certainly wasn't Mizrahi's most cohesive or innovative collection (he has been busy with his new Liz Claiborne duties, after all), but, as usual, he remained true to himself. ""I wanted to show actual luxury,"" he said post-show. ""And luxury for me means fur, color, and glitter. Glitter is actually comforting to me.""</p></div>"
111,fall,2009,f2009,isabel-marant,"Before we all quit shopping, Isabel Marant's Left Bank boutique was an important stop on the Paris circuit. In fashion speak, she ""makes clothes that girls want to wear."" Meaning they're not necessarily the kind that get photographed for glossy fashion spreads in magazines, but editors and retailers alike appreciate the streetwise way Marant mixes elegant and casual. Take the first look at the Fall show, a fur coat with cool three-quarter-length sleeves over one of her slouchy T-shirts and baggy silk python-print pants, which were tucked into sexy over-the-knee suede boots.</p><p>Marant said the attitude was glam rock meets London bad boys, circa the late fifties and early sixties. That added up to a leopard-print dress and a sweatshirt-gray jumpsuit worn with oversize men's jackets in tweed or herringbone, with big shoulders and sleeves rolled up to the elbows; and a belted little black dress with slashes of white paired with studded ankle boots. Layered in among her sweatshirts and denim jeans and minis were new-looking, softly ruched and gathered long skirts, and drop-waist silk shirtdresses. Apparently, her hard-rocking chicks have a little hippie in them. They're all priced to sell like crazy at the new stores she's scheduled to open in Los Angeles and New York this summer. With the exception of the shiny leggings with zips up the side, which made even the models look wide, sell is indeed what they'll do.</p></div>"
112,fall,2009,f2009,issa,"The models' hair and makeup made them look like Roxy Music cover girls, but I dialed forward a decade to Duran Duran's ""Rio,"" not just because Issa queen-pin Daniella Helayel is Brazilian, but because the clothes looked like the kind of easy, draped, dramatic pieces that might have been worn by party girls in the eighties. That decade's confident brashness could be traced through the zebra-print blouson, the fire-engine red blouse and cherry skirt, the jumpsuit with beaded zebra-patterned bodice and straps, and the graphic black and white tunic over leggings. So far, so logical. Except that Helayel had actually been looking at monks' robes! (Issa's always been a hard habit to break for Helayel's front row of firm, pouting beauties.) So the draped goddess dresses were, in fact, a carnal twist on the outfits worn by men of God. Likewise the black dress that gathered on one hip and the hood on a black velvet jacket delicately traced with beading. Any one of these outfits would turn the head of the local padre. A Brazilian <em>Thorn Birds</em>? Well, that's one of the more intriguing narratives of the week.</p></div>"
113,fall,2009,f2009,issey-miyake,"If you want to demonstrate the high-performance properties of your clothing, an extreme sport presents an obvious opportunity. Dai Fujiwara collaborated with karate masters on his new collection for Issey Miyake, developing fabrics and shapes that could take a licking and keep on ticking. During the show, the results were put to the test by those same masters (one man and three women, including a pair of French twins straight out of a Bond movie). The high-octane physicality of their performances was dazzling—the fact it didn't overpower the rest of Fujiwara's clothes underscored the strength of this collection. In a season full of references (twenties, forties, and, of course, eighties), it was refreshing to see something that looked so contemporary.</p><p>Pleating, a Miyake signature, was used here in concertinalike fashion on sleeves and pant legs, articulating movement in odd places like forearms and calves. The same kinetic principle was reflected in the engineered prints used for dresses, jackets, and pants, as well as in the diagonal seaming of androgynous tailoring, and the patchwork leggings. All of it suggested the body tautly moving beneath. Miyake himself was a poet <em>and</em> a technician when he helmed his own label. It was plain to see that Fujiwara tends more to the latter inclination, but a final group of light-as-air outfits, fluttering like delicate piles of striped hankies, evoked the pure poetry of the master.</p></div>"
114,fall,2009,f2009,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel, who presented his clothes in vignettes at the Chelsea Art Museum to much acclaim last season, was back in the tents for Fall. Why? Because, Mendel explained, his ""hard-edged"" clothes were about ""an attitude"" and needed to be seen in motion. It was the right choice, if only in the sense that the handwork details that made close-up viewing so exciting last Spring were nowhere to be seen. Missing was the color and craftsmanship that is the core of the J. Mendel brand identity. (Fur, of course, is also at the label's heart, and the designer used it sparingly, too—although a double-faced wool coat with broadtail inserts deserves mention.) There was but a glimmer of the old J. Mendel glamour in the beribboned, jewel-toned chiffon gowns that closed the show. So what happened? Mendel said he was putting more emphasis on daywear, but 40 looks later the audience was left searching for any message in this collection.</p></div>"
115,fall,2009,f2009,jaeger-london,"Iconic mannequin Carmen dell'Orefice's presence in the front row of the latest Jaeger show was a reminder that exactly 50 years ago, she was photographed semi-naked on a Caribbean beach by Norman Parkinson for a Jaeger campaign. That was a memorable moment in the brand's 125-year history. Karen Boyd, the brand's current head of design, tried to create another with a dark, dramatic collection that was a little too contrived to be entirely successful. The first look, for instance, was a strapless jumpsuit with a boxy little pagoda-shouldered jacket striped in black and ecru, like something from Glasgow's Arts and Crafts movement (Chris Kane featured a similar motif in his show earlier in the day). The same shoulder and the same banding dominated the show. They gave it a retro feel (sort of sci-fi retro, like <em>Blade Runner</em>), which came through elsewhere, in a polka-dotted tea dress, say, or an Art Deco print of glass shards, or a kimono coat in black and a shagreenlike shade of green. (Echoes of the archives, perhaps?) A lot of effort went into the textiles: hammered silks, boiled wools, crocheted overskirts, lacelike perforations, lacquering, and several herds of alpaca, which shed their pelts for skirts, jackets, and coats. But all that work wasn't so well served by the uniform darkness of the palette. Alternatives to the black were icily pale, almost android shades of green, blue, and cream.</p></div>"
116,fall,2009,f2009,jasmine-di-milo,"Jasmine Al Fayed's Fall collection was inspired, she said, by the changing face of the moon. There's a certain logic to that, because the primary focus of her nearly 6-year-old line is after-dark dressing. The show was divided into three groups—black velvet, sequins, and roses—and the silhouettes ranged from a tiny minidress with lacelike cutouts at the neckline to a strapless ball dress with frothy tulle skirts. It was a bit too dark in the Ritz's historic Windsor Suite to appreciate the details, but the 3-D sequined rosettes decorating the bodice of a long chiffon dress sparkled in the low light. And a few looks—silk satin suits with tapering pants, strong-shouldered jackets tied off with delicate silk ribbons—proved Al Fayed is capable of thinking beyond the nightclub. It would be nice to see her stretch more in that direction. For a 20-piece show, today's collection devoted too much attention to model-bodies-only unitards.</p></div>"
117,fall,2009,f2009,jason-wu,"Jason Wu's life changed overnight when Michelle Obama wore the 26-year-old designer's one-shoulder organza-embroidered white chiffon gown to the inaugural balls. The crowd at today's show was larger (sorry, folks, no First Lady), and there were more big-time editors in the front row, but Wu didn't change his pretty, polished formula. He said he was inspired by fairy tales, particularly a book of illustrations by Arthur Rackham that he had as a child. His focus, now more than ever, was dresses. A princess gown with sweeping skirts in midnight blue and silver point d'esprit closed the show, and before that came a pair of memorable body-skimming sheaths, the more dramatic in a gray cashmere mini-check with lacy black epaulets, as well as a couple of away-from-the-body flapper numbers, and two cartridge-pleated dresses in chartreuse and violet with jet beading at the hems. Any one of those would please a princess of the Park Avenue variety (assuming such a creature still exists). If there were a shortage of outerwear and other cold-weather-appropriate clothes, save for a striking electric-blue tiered faille opera coat with embroidered sleeves, can you blame him? After all, Wu's just giving the retailers—three times as many as last season have booked appointments—what they want. As a fledgling designer in this kind of economy, that's smart business.</p></div>"
118,fall,2009,f2009,jean-paul-gaultier,"If the invitation meant anything, sheathed as it was in black fishnets, we were in for a bit of kink at Jean Paul Gaultier. After an inordinately long wait, complete with a bit of police intrigue thanks to fur protesters outside, the curtains parted to reveal Gaultier's girls dressed in his-and-hers outfits. For the hims, there were three-piece suits, and for the hers, high-necked floaty chiffon numbers, one in a dollar-bill print.</p><p>Gaultier can take a theme and work it like nobody's business. There wasn't one look that didn't get the S&amp;M treatment, whether subtle or otherwise. There were fishnet insets on the thighs of some little black dresses; others came with big X's implanted on the bodice; and fur coats were encased in vests of cutout black leather. All this and masks by the dozen. The house-signature trenches this season came with backs or storm flaps laser-cut in the familiar stocking-grid pattern, too, but it was hard to imagine customers going for them. Not in this economy, and not when there are so many perfectly respectable alternatives out there.</p><p>Toward the end of the show, Coco Rocha, a house favorite, got into a knock-down, drag-out catfight with another model that ended only after a real-life dominatrix carrying a whip intervened. After the crowd got over its disbelief, it broke into wild laughter and applause. It was a bit of fashion theater that made everybody forget about the R-word for a while. And that's an achievement in itself these days.</p></div>"
119,fall,2009,f2009,jenni-kayne,"Jenni Kayne's goal for Fall was to go back to basics—not a far reach for a designer who's known for easy to pull on (and pull off) day-to-night separates. Standouts included a floor-skimming black dress with a lace overlay. That sounds stuffy, but the slim silhouette and the lace's geometrical design were anything but. Coats and blazers with fur- and bead-embellished sleeves (not both at once, thankfully) won't be to most girls' tastes, but there was plenty in the collection that felt young and fresh but never overly trendy. Kayne also launched shoes for the first time this season—worth a look for their below-$500 price range and sharp design. Oh, and for those of you wondering about the Kayne family Upper East Side residence where the presentation was held, let's just say: marble entryway, parquet floors, and Park Avenue views.</p></div>"
120,fall,2009,f2009,jeremy-laing,"Sending out models in anvil-shaped tops with funnel-shaped sleeves, Jeremy Laing kept geometry at the forefront. Some of the looks, especially those punctuated with strong seaming, were too severe; there was a robotic quality to some of the girls. Laing was more successful in the dress department, showing tunic-y pieces with gently embellished crystal belts slung low to draw attention to at least a bit of body and curve.</p><p>The prints, though, were the real story here: Black and gray starbursts lent levity to a rectangular shift, and a swirling copper pattern made for a nice contrast to all the shades of concrete. Delicate adjustable straps on the backs of coats and oversize tops gave an impression of airiness—proof that Laing does have a knack for finer details. The collection could have benefited from more of the same.</p></div>"
121,fall,2009,f2009,jil-sander,"Total clarity of vision and superb quality were the two elements that magnetized Jil Sander addicts for 20 years. They were back in full force at the beginning of Raf Simons' Fall show, demonstrating to all that the power of a spare double-faced cashmere coat over a simple turtleneck dress or a camel coat with narrow navy pants is undiminished. It was, quite deliberately, classic Sander, relying on nothing more than the visual beauty of spare proportions, perfectly tailored raised seams, covetable fabric, and a flat shoe—in a bright color to amp up the modernity. For a moment, it was a serene outbreak of sanity, when elevated design and purposeful fashion were, for once, walking in step. ""This is Jil heritage,"" Simons said later. ""I like it and it's always there, but sometimes we don't show it.""</p><p>Yet beneath the calm and the promise there was an unspoken drama unfolding offstage—the homage to the label's founder was in a way the final act at the end of an era. The atelier in Hamburg—which has been working continuously to produce Sander's samples even after Jil departed—is set to close, dispersing the skilled workers who built the house product. There was no official announcement of this, but at the end of the show an emotional Simons brought out Sander's head of atelier, Christel Von Kiedrowski, to share his bow.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>But before that happened, there was part two of the collection to take in: the segment in which Simons delivered his own vision for taking the brand forward. For a few seconds, the room fell into darkness, punctuated by colored flashing lights. Then he sent in clothes inspired by the mid-century French ceramicist Pol Chambost: shapes with sculptural curves; fold-back flanges; and spiraling, molded volumes. The Chambost references were in the glimpses of color—green, orange, yellow—flashing inside a funnel neck, a dipping hemline, or a peeled-away back view. As experiments in form, some looked awkward, literally vaselike, and seemingly not attuned to female figure or movement. Others, like the black dresses with flying points shooting off one shoulder, touched an elegance that could believably stand up at a cocktail party. In the broader context of fashion, it bore similarities to the work the likes of Roland Mouret and Nicolas Ghesquière have been doing, but it showed that Simons is ambitious to find his own way of designing for women. How hard he will find it to continue that degree of research without the resource of the Sander atelier remains to be seen. But with this collection he may have taught himself a lesson. If he can maintain the level of pragmatic clarity he demonstrated at the beginning, he will really keep his customers happy.</p></div>"
122,fall,2009,f2009,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart wants to rock—sartorially, that is. And so she did with a Fall collection inspired by ""iconic women of music."" Stuart mentioned Françoise Hardy, but also very present in this louche mix of leather, lace, and velvet were Anita Pallenberg, Stevie Nicks, and even a touch of early Madonna. As she's done in the past, Stuart played the look both ways—dark and vixen-y on the one hand and angelic on the other. In the latter camp was an ivory tailcoat on Marina Peres, worn, as most looks were, with a tilted fedora topped with lace flowers that immediately said: Bianca—Mick—wedding day. The many dandified tailcoats and use of millinery throughout served as the necessary masculine foil to Stuart's typically very girlish leanings. Leather pants, topped with fringed, webby knits or lace poet blouses, did the same. Then again, Stuart can't forget her core customer, who loves a pretty, straightforward frock, so a floral embroidered blush chiffon dress and a black bugle-beaded number slipped in without rippling the surface. The same can't be said of a plain black princess coat that made its wearer look like she'd taken a wrong turn somewhere. Perhaps she was the chaperone. After all, with a group of young girls wearing so much eye makeup, there's bound to be some bad behavior.</p></div>"
123,fall,2009,f2009,john-galliano,"John Galliano struck out on his own into the frozen wastes of Russian-Balkan folklore for Fall. A micro-bubble snowstorm was falling on the runway, and a trick of laser lighting created a magical illusion that the models were walking in some fairy-tale tunnel far, far removed from the brutish realities of humankind's current worries. It was theater, escapism—the creation of a parallel fantasy world upon which the concerns of ""fashion"" barely impinged.</p><p>Oodles of embroidery and workmanship and a ton of research into folk costume had been lavished on the details of the pannier-hipped, full-skirted coats, balloon-sleeved peasant blouses, bodices, headdresses, and pompom-trimmed cross-laced boots. Toward the end, the show moved into more traditional Galliano territory with a sequence of spun-silver bias-cut dresses that had all the delicate romance his fans adore.</p><p>Technically, it was faultlessly accomplished and—for anyone put off by the blanket of black that has fallen over many of the collections—offered some of the season's few opportunities to pick up color. But it remains to be seen whether those will be strong enough attractions to outweigh the fact that this show had very little to do with anything else that's going on.</p></div>"
124,fall,2009,f2009,jonathan-saunders,"Searching for a symbol of strength, Jonathan Saunders alighted on the notion of birds. It made for a colorful collection, even by this designer's typically electric standards. A lot of attention was focused on the torso, via cutouts or panels of metallic and iridescent beads, and on the shoulders, which were either built-up and sharp, or swaddled in folds and gathers of fabric. Saunders was a print designer first, and a zigzag pattern he created as a student at Central Saint Martins made an appearance here. There were also abstracted feathers on chiffon and a tribal print on a jacquard weave. The show was almost exclusively dresses and coats, so legs were the other focal point. The models, who wore black head stockings, strutted around the runway in booties, wedges, or platform pumps studded with brightly hued crystals.</p><p>If it sounds like there was a lot going on, there was. But it was held together, for the most part, by a rigorous color palette—crimson, marigold, teal, and black—and a recurring silhouette that was fitted above the waist and softly flaring below. Still, the most successful looks were the most streamlined, like a pair of red floor-length columns. One had swags of black fabric at the shoulders and was cinched with a wide tribal belt; the other had undulating black racing stripes down the sides and around the décolletage, making the most of the model's own natural curves.</p></div>"
125,fall,2009,f2009,josh-goot,"Josh Goot is the third designer in London to mention geology as his inspiration. Where Marios Schwab and Graeme Black looked at mineral deposits (as Peter Pilotto did last season), Goot was thinking of ""the organic lines of stone, and cutting and chiseling it."" Essentially, the idea led to delicately color-blocked neutral and black tailoring for Fall. A long section of cream and black jackets, pants, skirts, and dresses were, in some cases, cleverly constructed so that half a jacket was cream and the other black. After that came ripple effects that looked like contour lines on maps. The minimal sportswear look had an urban ease about it, but the audience was waiting for something more: a new representation of the prints that followers are beginning to expect from Goot. They were a long time coming, and attention flagged until they finally showed up as speckled patterns derived from rocks. They missed the vibrant punch of Goot's work last year, and by the end there was a sense that the collection could have been condensed by a third and still have got its message across.</p></div>"
126,fall,2009,f2009,juan-carlos-obando,"Juan Carlos Obando called his Fall collection ""a tribute to women who love fashion."" However, the designer wasn't just talking about any girl who loves an afternoon at Barneys. Specifically, Obando meant a woman, quite like his sometime muse Liz Goldwyn, who lives and dies for craftsmanship. At 25 looks, Fall was the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund finalist's biggest collection shown in New York. He opened strong with a trio of short dresses crafted with his intricate twisting, pleating, and draping technique. Angelic and all-white, they were almost smudged here and there with color: pink, purple, or gray. Obando further flexed his atelier expertise in looks done up in flat, razored chiffon ruffles and waving scalloped layers. But the ethereal was only half the story. He injected a sportswear aspect into the precious proceedings by cutting things down to smart jackets and tops, which were then paired with slim silk pants made from his recent discovery, silk wool. With that fabric, Obando entered experimental mode, doing stiff constructed dresses and boxy tops, plain in front and with a dramatic sculptural flourish in back. With the twisted knots of silver beads (surprisingly and ingeniously light) and a halo of curls, the effect suggested a wonderfully mad lunching lady. A few fit hiccups made those dresses and suits a work in progress, but the series of white jersey gowns that closed the show sailed by as breezy and beautiful as can be.</p></div>"
127,fall,2009,f2009,julian-louie,"Economic woes aside, it's an exciting time for New York fashion, as once-new labels evolve into serious businesses while a promising freshman class moves into its young designer shoes. With the heat of Francisco Costa as a mentor and a standout 15-look debut, Julian Louie is one of the buzziest of the bunch. His second collection comes forth from a stream of references: the discovery of a hefty felt, which led to the idea of riveted clothes, to tectonic plates, to armor, and then to samurai armor. Oh, and then there's the matador thing. In practice, Louie was exploring ""austere layering."" Every look began with a sleek, almost alien-looking (in a good way) microfiber dress or top that the designer described as a ""second skin."" Over that went a white shirt with a stiff imperial collar, and tailored jackets, skirts, and dresses that looked like they were crafted from various hammered panels of felt and Swarovski beading. A highly modern and original vision, for sure, but also quite feminine and even sexy, with bold shoulders, flaring hips, nipped waists, and sleek little pants on looks that echoed a torero silhouette. It's also an approach with a potentially tricky runway-to-reality translation. ""I'm taking it extremely slow,"" said Louie of his retail strategy. Good thing. Certainly, any one of those upperclassmen can tell you that success takes time.</p></div>"
128,fall,2009,f2009,julien-macdonald,"With his inveterate love of glam and attraction to the bright lights of tabloid fame, Julien Macdonald and his reputation—though flying high in the British name-recognition stakes—had long sunk beneath the horizon as far as opinion-formers were concerned. Now, though, with a new backer, Jamey Hargreaves, Macdonald is putting himself through fashion rehab. ""I've stopped all the nonsense and partying,"" he pledges. ""I'm just working really hard, nonstop. All I've ever wanted is to make women feel glamorous and amazing when they walk into a room.""</p><p>Oddly enough, Macdonald's new attempt at credibility has synchronized perfectly with a certain twist of taste that has his name on it: rock chick super-glamour. The fact that big-shouldered, bling-festooned dressing is now being shamelessly enjoyed by Christophe Decarnin at Balmain (and his many fans) doesn't make Macdonald an imitator—he was already there ten or so years ago. Add to that the fact that inventive, slightly punky laddered knitwear is on the fashion roster again and you have two strikes in favor of this Welsh national celebrity: He, after all, was the talented knitter who made that look fashionable in the early nineties.</p><p>The opening of Macdonald's Fall collection of super-shouldered, Montana-esque biker looks, underpinned by his own spiderweb knits, looked sharp, controlled, cleaned up, and well executed enough to persuade skeptics to take a second glance. He can cut a mean pant and whisk up a knit, as well as labor for hours over mirror and crystal-smothered dresses. On third inspection backstage, the work (which must benefit from Macdonald's time at Givenchy) is sophisticated enough to be measured by Paris standards. Perhaps it will work again as a rebooted, serious business, and perhaps not, given the climate. But there's no doubt that Julien Macdonald is going to give it his most serious shot yet.</p></div>"
129,fall,2009,f2009,junya-watanabe,"Leave it to Junya Watanabe to take a generic utility garment—in this case, a chill-blocking down jacket—and elevate it to an incredible level of romantic imagination. ""Feathers and air"" were in his mind when he began work with the tubular components of a puffer and then started treating it to myriad turns of construction that lifted it far away from its casual origins. It's a Junya-ism to transform almost any material that comes his way into an Edwardian riding coat, but that was just the warm-up. To the strains of arias from Puccini's <em>Madame Butterfly</em> and <em>Tosca</em>, he made concentric circles of padded nylon serially assume the characteristics of Poiret cocoons, cloaks, capes, stoles, peplum jackets, peacoats. After an interlude in which Watanabe gathered in thoughts about draping (a few black asymmetric tunics worn over leggings) and veiled gold lamé, the process took off again as an increasingly free-form exercise in soft sculpture. By the end, gilded chains were encircling the poufy forms, now reconfigured as dresses and wraps.</p><p>Still, as ingenious and dramatic as it was, this latest work is only a continuation of Watanabe's signature knack of performing context-shifting tweaks and hybridization procedures on the ""found"" materials of commonplace clothing—African batiks, denim, Liberty prints, the stuff of military uniforms, and Chanel-ish tweeds, to list only a few. In one way, it always gives the sense of watching a master class in conceptual Japanese thinking, but in another, it's better than that. Watanabe's real talent is his humility. He never allows himself to run so far into the outer reaches of theory that the practical value of the original article is lost. In this collection, suffice to say, there are warm winter coats that are just warm winter coats, and those will sell as functional classics.</p></div>"
130,fall,2009,f2009,just-cavalli,"The Just Cavalli runway show was canceled two days ago after Ittierre, the Italian manufacturer that makes Roberto Cavalli's younger line, became the latest company to fall prey to the recession. But the designer isn't prepared to give up without a fight. ""I hope with all my heart that these pieces will be produced,"" he said at a press conference and at the small showroom presentation today, hinting that he may take the process temporarily in-house. ""It's <em>grinta</em>,"" he declared. ""Strong, edgy, forceful, charismatic—like me.""</p><p>Like so many other designers this season, Cavalli has been vibing on the rocker/biker chick look made popular by Balmain's Christophe Decarnin. A rugged black leather motocross jacket was paired with a silver-studded net dress, and a tuxedo jacket topped a rhinestone-covered sleeveless minidress. Denim, Cavalli reminded the audience, is what first made his name ten years ago, and here it came frayed and ripped or in a black and white acid wash that was patchworked into a fitted long-sleeve dress with silver chain trim at the hem. If these ideas were hardly revolutionary, they were well executed for their eventual price tags. There are plenty of girls eager to get this tough and sexy look in the three- or four—not five—figure range, should the resilient Mr. Cavalli manage to get it made.</p></div>"
131,fall,2009,f2009,kai-kuhne,"Kai Kühne is a colorful character, but he saw things in black and white (and gray) for Fall. He visualized his models as ""survivors with the deepest of pedigree"" walking away from their burned palaces with heads held high. This somewhat doom-y plot line was translated into the clothes via tonalities and textiles (one fabric's finish resembling a charred log, for instance).</p><p>Kühne revisited the dart-slim silhouette introduced for Spring but stretched it to a ""more than conservative"" mid-calf length, which worked on the runway for the most part, although stores will probably ask him to raise hemlines before the clothes hit the sales floor. The dresses—including several with chic black and white angled stripes—showcased the precise Pythagorean geometry of Kühne's pattern-making, which is truly impressive. Still, it would have been nice to see it applied to more than one shape. Cropped jackets, an oversize coat with asymmetric lapels, and a suit with of-the-moment zipper detailing offered some variety.</p><p>Kühne is clearly motivated to pick up the pace of his career. He's got strong new financial backing, Róisín Murphy performed at his after-party, and he showed accessories on the runway for the first time (along with one menswear look—a hint of things to come?). With so many positive things happening, it's difficult to understand why he opted for such a languid parade, instead of an up-tempo one in keeping with his bright trajectory.</p></div>"
132,fall,2009,f2009,karen-walker,"She's ""Cracked."" That was the theme of Karen Walker's show, which had its beginnings in the designer's decade-deep archive, from which she unearthed a favorite print of a broken strand of pearls. ""We love the beauty that comes out of catastrophe,"" said Walker backstage, ""and the brittle nature of things.""</p><p>The first look out was anything but broken-down: a quite pulled-together square-shouldered and square-bodied trench over black cigarette pants, punctuated by lipstick-red patent pumps. Soon enough, though, the fissures began to appear—in the crackled leather of a black motorcycle jacket, the breakaway flaps on jersey tops that hung below boxy jackets, and Walker's charming graphics (including the resurrected pearls and a colorful new shattered-china-plate print).</p><p>She tempered her gone-to-pieces motif with strong and simple silhouettes and, right on trend, paid close attention to the shoulder with a princess sleeve on steroids that appeared on cute sweatshirt dresses and built up in petal-like layers on smart little shifts. It was a strong collection with loads of sellable yet quirky separates. And, frankly, is there a better time for fashion that celebrates the beauty that can blossom after things fall apart?</p></div>"
133,fall,2009,f2009,karl-lagerfeld,"The ever-onward Karl Lagerfeld is not inclined to the backward glance. So in a season when everyone else is doing their version of the 1980's, a decade he helped define, it made perfect sense that he was focused on the 2080's—or, OK, at least the future. The metal-machine music of Metronomy introduced a collection whose thrust was technology and architecture. The models wore fur helmets with inset iPods (cushioning against the crash?), and Lagerfeld referred to the built-out shoulder that defined the silhouette as ""the bridge.""</p><p>As ever, this signature line was defined by a handful of branded elements: a leanness accentuated by the skinniest pants in Paris; a masculine, even military, hardness; a hint of the Vienna Secession in draped, black-velvet-banded eveningwear. This time, however, those ""bridge"" shoulders added a warrior-woman edge. And the long, languid line that formerly characterized the Lagerfeld label was replaced by a more structured look in short-sleeved jackets and skirts in silvered tweeds and mélange fabrics. But even Karl couldn't completely avoid an echo of everyone else's eighties. A square-shouldered, severely tailored black suit was right out of the closet of Rachael the Replicant from <em>Blade Runner</em>, 1982's definitive style guide. Interestingly, it was one of the show's more persuasive looks.</p></div>"
134,fall,2009,f2009,katy-rodriguez,"""Because I also see the retail side of things, I see what people are buying,"" designer Katy Rodriguez explained at tonight's presentation. She was speaking, of course, of the perspective she gains as the co-owner of vintage mecca Resurrection. ""They're going for special, one-off pieces,"" she added. At the store that might mean a one-of-a-kind Azzaro; here Rodriguez looked to her own past as inspiration.</p><p>Voluminous ruffled miniskirts and strapless taffeta dresses made up the collection. As the designer put it, ""a whole fifties-meets-eighties thing."" The sweetness of a retro party dress turned edgy with thigh-grazing hems, patent-leather straps, and a vintage bondage pinup print. It was an homage, she said, to her early years as a club kid. It's a shame the likes of Area can't be resurrected, because these frocks deserve that kind of adventurous setting.</p></div>"
135,fall,2009,f2009,kenzo,"Antonio Marras' response to fashion's fiscal woes was an escape into the romance of Mother Russia—with winsomely detailed show notes rolled up inside little <em>matryoshka</em> dolls that waited on everyone's seat. A passing nod to <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> cued the designer's focus on love in a time of revolution: For every folkloric flounce there was a Bolshevik reference, too. It made for a collection of distinct contrasts: the pouf-sleeved, tiered dress in a gilded floral print that opened the show, say, versus a jacket and skirt of transfigured military fatigues. An army jacket over a floor-sweeping skirt brought to mind Diane Keaton in <em>Reds</em>, but Marras was rarely that literal. One apparatchik ensemble was banded in fur; peasant patchwork was quilted into a high-necked coat-dress; another coat might have been suitable for the front line if it hadn't been sequined in gold.</p><p>There was a lot of inspiration in Marras' source materials—all those ""lonely dachas,"" as he put it, filled with embroideries, tapestries, and carpets. He ramped up the florals in a series of draped dresses, but the show's doses of floor-length action made it hard to escape the lingering sense that the air in those lonely dachas might be a bit stuffy. A cable-knit dress studded with holly berries (that's holly, not Halle) scarcely blew out the cobwebs.</p></div>"
136,fall,2009,f2009,kinder-aggugini,"Kinder Aggugini's debut might have come across as an entirely proper affair of tailoring and soft printed dresses were it not for the clue embedded on either side of Erin O'Connor's head. The model may have been wearing a quite conservative, though well judged, navy pantsuit and a couple of pretty layered camisoles, but her little flicked-up ""ears"" of hair directly evoked Soo Catwoman, the famous punk fixture of Kings Road circa 1977.</p><p>That giveaway is a key to Aggugini's background and track record: Far from being the usual defenseless upstart-around-London, he's an experienced Italian designer who fell in love with British street style of the late seventies and early eighties, got himself into Central Saint Martins, and since then has worked his way around fashion via a bespoke tailoring gig at Huntsman in Savile Row and studio jobs at Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith, and Versace. He's been in business on his own account for two years, testing out his neat redingotes; double-breasted coats; Coco-channeling tweed jackets; and high-shouldered, narrow-sleeved evening peacoats on fashion editors—a picky lot who have flocked in increasing numbers to place private orders from him at his Bayswater flat.</p><p>It's given him four seasons' grace to work out signatures—polka-dot silk linings, ribbon ties laced into cuffs, antique jet buttons, tailor's tacks left to trace the lines of jackets and coats, and a way with splashy floral prints. The result: the welcome public launch of a brand that aims to approach a grown-up ""working woman"" wardrobe without the heart-sinking predictability that usually entails.</p></div>"
137,fall,2009,f2009,koi-suwannagate,"Koi Suwannagate showed her 15-plus-piece Fall collection to editors and buyers in the penthouse suite at the Morgans Hotel, and the room's bright, natural light showed off the best aspects of her delicately rendered knit and cashmere offerings. Vintage brass buttons glinted on a boyfriend sweater—a big camel cardigan with a deconstructed argyle pattern in rust and steel gray—that, Suwannagate revealed, she'd hoped would be part of a men's capsule collection that she didn't have time to make. Instead, the designer spent her time on slim cigarette pants in stretch Lycra with a swath of cashmere running up both sides—""to make you look slimmer""—and paper-thin tops in soft black, nude, and pale pink. Delicately beaded fingerless gloves craftily spelled out the designer's name (and would make any outfit instantly special), and an oversize black wool cape-cum-vest had a few of Suwannagate's signature rosettes on the back to make it stand out.</p></div>"
138,fall,2009,f2009,kris-van-assche,"""I wanted to do something that felt right, not just on the catwalk but in any situation,"" Kris Van Assche said backstage. This designer has been known to indulge an eccentric notion or two, but today he produced a generally straightforward collection, rendered in black and white, of shrunken-down clothes borrowed from a guy's closet. The necessary feminine element came courtesy of necklaces and bracelets made from gold and silver military ribbons.</p><p>Sharp-looking cropped jackets and slouchy long johns (modified from Van Assche's men's show) were teamed with either sheer button-downs or thin turtlenecks. Wrapping was a unifying theme, with buttonless trenchcoats, blazers, and vests tied off at the waist. A few gaucho-style pants cinched above the ankles added a bit of extra swagger, but the wool trousers with apronlike sheer silk panels came off like a silly runway experiment. The series of caftans that opened the show also seemed like a ploy for catwalk attention.</p><p>Here's the thing: The clothes that Van Assche mostly focused on today aren't the kind to generate a lot of heat at a fashion show. But they do look like the sort of pieces that a fashionable customer might wear day in and day out. In that regard, this was a case of mission accomplished.</p></div>"
139,fall,2009,f2009,l-wren-scott,"""Earthy"" isn't a term you'd immediately apply to a tall drink of water like L'Wren Scott, but after being inspired by the wind last season, the designer has moved on to a second element: terra firma. She named this collection ""Bois de Boulogne"" after the falling leaves and barren trees outside her studio window. Also influential were the forest-y motifs of British artist Adam Ball, whose white-on-white cutout works served as a backdrop for today's presentation at the Gagosian Gallery. It was Scott who provided the color, a gorgeously rich range of greens in a palette that the designer said was her most varied ever. Forests have something of a moody, fairy-tale quality, and that suits Scott's romantic, witchy leanings just fine— witness a sharp bottle-green Edwardian frock coat, cut with a high slit to reveal a hint of the sequined gown glimmering beneath.</p><p>Rather than exit the stage, the models lined up one by one in front of Ball's cutouts. They did so with their backs to the audience, which this time around included Rachel Feinstein Currin and Dustin Hoffman, as well as Scott's number-one fan, Mick Jagger. This wasn't bad manners, but rather a ploy to showcase the trellis of red embroidery snaking down the rear of a lean, black coat or to underline that a prim, long-sleeved frock had another trick up its sleeve: a completely open back.</p><p>Dramatic, yes, but Scott's strength is that she combines that with versatility. Afterward, Kyra Sedgwick took a minute to choose her favorites from a collection filled with best-dressed options. She settled on a body-hugging Kelly day dress sweetly topped with a cardigan ""for real life,"" and an emerald column with a jet-beaded bodice for the red carpet. ""They're one of the most comfortable dresses to wear,"" she said of Scott's strict silhouettes, which would seem to betray every excess crumb. ""They make you look great from every angle.""</p></div>"
140,fall,2009,f2009,lacoste,"In his program notes, Christophe Lemaire name-dropped Diane Keaton, Princess Leia, André Courrèges, James Turrell…and René Lacoste, <em>bien sûr</em>. But his Fall show for Lacoste was hardly about such highfalutin references. This heavily layered collection, rendered in calming colors like winter white, pale blue, gray, and yellow, was retail-ready rather than fashion-forward. If the ties and wrap belts and stripes produced a sense of déjà vu from past shows, the clothes were also eminently wearable: Double-face coats looked luxe and jersey jackets sporty. Lemaire's success came in capturing the comfort and ease of a lazy Sunday morning—with a soupçon of that French je ne sais quoi. It's a message with undeniable appeal in these turbulent times.</p></div>"
141,fall,2009,f2009,lanvin,"""People keep trying to divide designers into optimists and pessimists, but me—I'm a realist,"" declared Alber Elbaz. ""I thought with my heart about what women need from fashion—dresses, suits, blouses, coats. Life isn't just parties and lunches."" With this empathetic orientation, Lanvin for Fall added another dimension to the revival of Parisian values that are turning out to be the distinguishing feature of the best of this season's collections.</p><p>At first sight, there was something that evoked the forties in the abbreviated, sober chic of the dresses and suits that marched down a long concrete runway that had been doused with water to look like a regular, nonglamorous street. In fact, Elbaz's cutting, with its bias wraps, drapes, subtle knots, and bunchy bows, owes little to retro and much more to enabling a modern woman to go about her business in a tough time. A sense of presence and energy comes into it—the fierce economy of style that boils down to a simple-seeming waisted silhouette, black gloves, pumps.</p><p>Still, there is something here—and maybe this is the ""Parisian"" part—that refuses to sink into banal austerity. Elbaz's natural inclination is to make women feel happy—and that means sneaking plenty of sparkle into the seams from time to time, adding giant tubular neckpieces, and including considerately thought-out accessories like fur stoles sewn onto a loop, ready to pull on over…whatever. However, nothing at Lanvin ever comes at less than top price. In a tanking economy, that would seem to contradict Elbaz's stated aim to embrace ""realism"" and the generality of women's daily concerns. It all depends, though, how pennies are counted, how long clothes can be worn, and whether they're destined to be made obsolete by fashion within six months. With this collection, Elbaz deliberately built a defense against that lack of confidence, going back to re-do pieces (like the raw-edged charmeuse dresses) he first came up with five years ago. His message: What was good then is just as good now, and what's bought now can have just as much value years hence. In a year when all other financial investments look like a joke, a Lanvin one is as rock-solidly trustworthy as fashion can be.</p></div>"
142,fall,2009,f2009,lela-rose,"""It's Jane Goodall if she were chic,"" joked Lela Rose backstage after her show, which merged her colorful uptown oeuvre with the narrative of a lady entomologist in the rain forest. Goodall studied chimps in Africa, but this is fashion, people, not <em>Jeopardy</em>, so Rose's beautiful palette was more Amazonian in nature. She mixed a host of greens—moss, peacock, forest—with exotic insect-inspired jewel tones. At this point, though, Rose doesn't need the natural world to inform her sure sense of color or print. What was most interesting here was to see the designer work more utilitarian aspects into her sweetly feminine look. This collection seemed to be an answer (intentional or not) to how a pretty-dress designer moves ahead when fashion's collective beat is drumming with a harder edge. That was evident in a drab trench in gorgeous ribbed cashmere tossed over a citrine cocktail frock, or even in small gestures like the layering of knits and simple belting of waists that would once have been left loose and boxy. Rose's collection pushed forward without threatening to alienate her clientele, suggesting that she's traversing fashion's jungle just fine.</p></div>"
143,fall,2009,f2009,libertine,"Johnson Hartig and Cindy Greene returned to New York fashion week with as serious a case of Anglomania as they've ever had. Guests at their scenic presentation in Soho were greeted by a (shivering) Royal Guard and clothes screen-printed with the visage of Queen Elizabeth II. (Liz was drawn by California artist Eric Ernest Johnson, whose work Hartig collects. Johnson also contributed images of Rasputin and the party scene from <em>The Shining</em>.) Hartig, who said he felt ""propelled by the economy to be more creative,"" might have worried that if Libertine stayed away too long people would forget them—but he and his design partner got as warm a Big Apple welcome as they did when they first hit the scene with their repurposed vintage clothing eight years ago.</p><p>Fall was presented in a hay-strewn space on models wearing both production-line pieces and one-offs, which are the heart of the label. Watch your back, Rugby: Libertine's school-tie blazers looked like cult items right out of the gate to us, especially when emblazoned with crest patches featuring subversive motifs like a swan with a broken neck, a dead fish floating among beer cans and cigarette butts, and a certain part of the male anatomy standing at attention. ""We wanted to turn the fussy, Waspy world upside down,"" Hartig said. Mission accomplished.</p></div>"
144,fall,2009,f2009,limi-feu,"Edwardian England shaped modern Japan's notions of menswear, so the waistcoat has always been a building block for designers like Issey, Yohji, and Rei. You can add Limi to the list. The designer worked it every which way in her new collection, making for one of the male/female interplays that has become as much her signature as that of her father, Yamamoto père.</p><p>In Limi's hands, the vest came full and double-breasted over sailor pants tucked into kneesocks. It was shrunken to nothing over a bright white shirt, or shown with little cap sleeves, or elongated into asymmetrical points (over a white cotton shirtdress), or even combined in a waistcoat/jacket hybrid. The reworking of one idea through the course of a show is something of a Japanese design tic, but Limi had fun with it, turning her chosen item into a fur gilet tied at the back, a big cross-belted knit, and a cardigan scarf.</p><p>A spirit of play has always made this designer's work stand out from the rest of the Tokyo tribe. And this season, even though there was an elegant maturity to a bouclé coat or a funnel-collared tweed suit shot through with Lurex, that was balanced by flapper dresses of fringed knit (worn with fluoro stockings) and tiered, coin-dotted tulles. Those said Limi's not getting all grown-up and serious on us just yet.</p></div>"
145,fall,2009,f2009,loewe,"A leather-goods house taking to the runway with a ready-to-wear collection—with logos? Sounds like a high-nineties flashback, if not an anachronistic happening in days when so many other houses are scaling back or thinking better of having shows altogether. Yet here was Loewe, the Spanish leather-goods company (part of LVMH), which is design-directed by the British bag specialist Stuart Vevers, reversing its policy of sophisticated static exhibitions and deciding to use models in the standard way—swinging handbags, of course.</p><p>Subtlety and extreme quality are the key qualities of Loewe's leathers, but the act of dressing girls top to toe and having them walk in front of an audience and photographers forced an inevitable shift of focus. The luxurious craftsmanship that goes into making fine leather pieces like the black jackets and coats, with supple, fused linings visible in the folded-back lapels, isn't in question. But was it really timely to start branding a sophisticates' resource with perforated lettering declaring ""Loewe Madrid"" across the breast of leather poufed-sleeve T-shirts and shifts, or to emboss it boldly on a coral suede shoulder bag? Probably not.</p><p>Up till now, Loewe's artily lit static presentations have been characterful, sociable events, allowing for the close-up viewing—and even touching—of its fine-grained textures and workmanship. That encouraged the idea that this is a niche brand for grown women who consider it smart to invest in a timeless, underexposed product that deliberately sets itself apart from fashion. It wasn't that Vevers plunged the whole thing into a vat of vulgarity today, but the pressure to make statements for runway cameras (feather skirts, woven ribbon and leather pieces) inevitably blew away some of the mystique he's cultivated with his previously more personal approach.</p></div>"
146,fall,2009,f2009,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs ended the season at Louis Vuitton in Paris as he began it with his own show in New York: with the eighties. Different city, different accent, though, and this slice of the late eighties—ruffled, ruched, and poufed as it was—looked as if Jacobs had pulled out his 1987 magazines and worked up a playful homage to Christian Lacroix. He didn't quite put it that way backstage, however. Jacobs said that, partly in preparation for the <em>Model as Muse</em> exhibition at the Met and his role as honorary chair of the opening gala, he was thinking of ""all those great French muses of the late eighties."" Specifically, he cited Marie Seznec (who modeled for Lacroix), Victoire de Castellane (who worked for Chanel), and Inès de la Fressange (who was virtually French fashion mascot in chief at the time).</p><p>Looking back on those days of chichi fashion extremes brought out a lot of <em>jeune Parisienne</em> frivolity in the clothes, if not the staging, which was done, pseudo-salon style, without a runway (albeit in a large transparent tent parked, as usual, in a courtyard of the Louvre). The chance of a close inspection revealed lots of puffy peplum jackets, tons of shirring and ruching (in print or leather), bubble skirts, bejeweled satin leggings, and a mini lace Marie Antoinette pannier dress with a saucy sheer balconette. Jacobs' take on big shoulders ran from grosgrain bow-smothered balloon puffs to the widest short coats (in camel or red) on any runway—almost as broad as they were long.</p><p>It was also a rich accessory fest for the leather goods company. Leather necklaces and belts came fashioned like paper chains, and thigh boots were topped with ruffles and balanced on pearl and glitter-covered heels. The all-important bags had also acquired eighties pie-crust frills and gilded monograms. If it wasn't quite the fashion tour de force of Vuitton's Spring collection, this penultimate show of an often dour and cautious season read as a welcome interlude of cheerful, flirty confidence in a post-crash depression.</p></div>"
147,fall,2009,f2009,louise-goldin,"Louise Goldin is the girl who has stretched knitwear to embrace the future, breaking out of all the cozy limitations suggested by the term ""sweater dressing."" The collection she showed was entirely in black, which was a pity—though only in that it wasn't possible to make out exactly what she was up to, even in close-up. Essentially, it was long-lined silhouettes of knit sliced with black leather, as well as an evolution into fur in a few fierce jackets that took her pieces to luxury level. ""It was a long experimentation process,"" she said. ""All these challenging things I love, but I never knew whether it was going to work or not."" It certainly turned out successfully in the fox-sleeved jacket whose salt-and-pepper tweed front was knitted by Goldin herself on a machine and—at the other, more basic extreme—the knit leggings with leather stripes embedded on the side. In between, there were many complex multi-yarn sweater dresses the designer-boffin had achieved by patiently setting computers to pull wondrous innovation out of standard machines. The result looked like dark, intergalactic warrior-woman armor, but thought through in a way that might assure Goldin a future as someone who can sell items, rather than just be praised as a visionary.</p></div>"
148,fall,2009,f2009,luca-luca,"A few seasons in, Raul Melgoza is honing his point of view. The challenge? To honor the brand's history as a favorite of the social set—a go-to label for bright colors and playful cocktail frocks—while ushering in a certain architectural cleanliness to keep things from getting overdone. ""Strong in character and feminine in look"" is how the designer described the Luca Luca image, and he stuck to an understated palette of charcoal and burgundy with jewel-tone teal now and again. For the most part, the collection was quite refined, with luxurious embellishments, oversize cocktail jewelry, and (a first for Melgoza) fur. One wool-knit vest layered in fox was shown as a belted dress—albeit a short one. The emphasis, though, was on suiting, with the flat-front silk-wool pants that opened the show being one of the most chic options. The sparkle on a few of the evening gowns was reminiscent, unfortunately, of a figure skater's costume, but otherwise the glitz and glitter were downplayed. (The opulent setting, in the Palm Court at the Plaza, more than made up for that.)</p></div>"
149,fall,2009,f2009,luella,"""Cute utilitarianism"" is the tag Luella Bartley gave her punk-y, schoolgirl-y, military look, which was marched out by a gang of girls who seemed to be going to the prom via junior cadet corps. If it was less clashingly bright than her outstanding Summer collection, it was just as assured and detailed (this time with lots of gold zips, buttons, and hook-and-eye fastenings), and essentially based around the same template of short dresses and neat little suits that won her British Designer of the Year last November.</p><p>""Building a brand"" can sound like a dull and onerous mission these days, especially for a junior-focused designer who came out of London's free and easy years. Yet that's exactly what Bartley is proving herself capable of now. There's value for money in each of her outfits, from all the patchworking of contrasting fabrics that goes on in a single piece (a dress might be made up of a polka-dot top fused to a draped bustier, connected to a wool skirt) down to the Confederate caps and fur pompoms on the toes of her pumps. The sense of continuity shows an impressive business focus, but even better, somehow, is the way Bartley will also break into a bit of gold lamé to keep things ""up.""</p></div>"
150,fall,2009,f2009,luisa-beccaria,"Luisa Beccaria presented her Fall collection at the Villa Necchi Campiglio, a newly restored onetime private Milanese residence built in the early thirties. The parquet floors, high ceilings, and bookshelf-lined walls were a good match for Beccaria's unapologetically romantic vision. These clothes looked like they could have stepped out of a period movie, or perhaps been pulled from the mansion's upstairs closets, where original Chanel and Gucci creations still hang.</p><p>The designer said she was putting a new emphasis on daywear. Her first models floated across the villa's parlor floor wearing shirtwaist dresses in powdery shades of silk and portrait-collar skirtsuits in metallic tweeds. If those were too precious, a striking sleeveless belted sheath, in a dégradé fabric that shaded from gold at the shoulders to deep blue at the hem, had real-world potential.</p><p>The dreaminess factor can make Beccaria's party numbers sing. Tops for after dark were the scalloped metallic-lace mermaid dresses with trains. Even in a time of downscaling, those should help further raise her profile on both the New York City party circuit and the red carpet.</p></div>"
151,fall,2009,f2009,lutz-patmos,"Tina Lutz and Marcia Patmos not only carried their interest in seasonless knits from Spring to Fall, but hung on to their guest designer, Jane Birkin, too. ""She's absolutely our dream muse of all time,"" Patmos said. The icon, who just released a new album, contributed an organic cashmere V-neck dress to a lineup that Lutz &amp; Patmos wanted to be about ease—both calming to look at and inviting to touch. To that end the palette was muted—bone, gray, black, mocha, and mauve—and the shapes nothing if not familiar: peacoats, grandpa cardis, blazers, all refit with special details intended to make them ""keepers."" Inevitably, you don't look for news in this collection. ""We want to offer well-designed pieces of good quality at a good price that are worth spending money on,"" Patmos explained.</p></div>"
152,fall,2009,f2009,lyn-devon,"Lyn Devon has racked up a lot of kudos in a short amount of time, and this concise collection of American sportswear, presented by appointment at Antony Todd's boutique, demonstrated why. ""In this economy I want to offer women something that makes them happy and shows that they are optimistic,"" said Devon, an alum of Brown University and Parsons the New School for Design. She offered iconic pieces like the shirtdress, boyfriend blazer, and bomber jacket in beautiful textured fabrics, some printed, all in seductive colors. Cocktail options included jersey-topped, full-skirted dance numbers (with a whiff of Claire McCardell about them) and corseted strapless dresses—some accessorized with Bliss Lau for Lyn Devon metal belts. A coat-dress made up of a blown-out houndstooth print embellished with heat-pressed Swarovski crystals was the single flashy piece; otherwise, this was a lineup of upbeat and spirited classics that looked like solid investments in any financial climate.</p></div>"
153,fall,2009,f2009,maison-martin-margiela,"If an ""invisible"" designer has finally dematerialized, will anyone actually be able to tell the difference? Such is the philosophical conundrum facing the many fans of Martin Margiela. Outside the company, no one knows anything about the whereabouts of one of modern fashion's greatest heroes, and the is-he, isn't-he retiring gossip that started a year ago has become one big snore. In the absence of any definitive corporate statement, the only test of whether Margiela is still in the house must be down to whether the inimitable dialogue of excellence, intellectual challenge, and wit is still there in his show. Safe, yet very sad to say, this time it was gone.</p><p>There have been many seasons when Margiela's collections have been lauded for being brilliant comings-together of thoughts, and many others when they've been rejected, panned, and found offensive. There have been none, however, where the work has been of so little consequence. The Margiela-isms seemed to be there, sort of: the tan bodysuits mimicking nakedness, the Perspex shoulder pads, the so-called ""deconstructionist"" cutouts, the leggings pulled over shoes, the grown-on collars worn as hoods, the tinselly boas. Yet all of it seemed to be done by rote, as if it had been pulled out of the label's back catalog, without any sense of a vivid intelligence pushing an idea toward new conclusions.</p><p>Often the end of Margiela's shows could feel like a cliff-hanger, where the audience would be left with a sick-thrilled sensation of wondering where, and how, his ideas could possibly manifest themselves. Later they always would, one way or another, and often in the collections of other designers many seasons later. The reason, for instance, that giant shoulder pads are ""in"" right now, this season, is that Margiela single-handedly pushed them way out there two years ago. His impact on fashion is vast, and now in its absence, a loss to be mourned, not just by loyal fans who are from now on looking for somewhere else to shop, but by an entire industry that has depended on Martin Margiela's genius contributions to drive fashion forward.</p></div>"
154,fall,2009,f2009,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The twentysomethings and teens that the Marc by Marc Jacobs collection targets are perfect candidates for the sort of eighties Danceteria redux the designer pulled off so brilliantly at his ""big sister"" show. After all, they were either in diapers or missed the decade entirely the first time around. But Jacobs took a sharp turn off the island of Manhattan circa 1984 for his kid-sister line.</p><p>That's not to say that it wasn't fun. It's just that in their hiking boots and woolly socks, striped tights, blanket scarves, and felt Molly Ringwald hats, his models looked more like junior mountaineers than they did club-hoppers. They were the good twins to his signature line's hellions in neon.</p><p>As always, it was a mad mix. The components this time around were argyle or intarsia sweaters, belted oversize herringbone sports jackets, baggy wide-wale corduroy shorts, union suits, and a striking red windowpane-plaid dress with pointy shoulders that hinted at the proportions seen on his runway last night. But in the end, vintage-feel shirtwaist dresses, one or two shot through with Lurex, are as rocking as the M.M.J. girl will get this season.</p></div>"
155,fall,2009,f2009,marc-jacobs,"Leave it to Marc Jacobs to deliver a neon-hued, big-shouldered, crimpy-haired eighties antidote to the gloom and doom of 2009. ""I was thinking about the good old days in New York,"" he said after the show, ""when getting dressed up was such a joy."" By the good old days, Jacobs means the nights he spent at clubs like Area, the Palladium, and Paradise Garage. Maybe it was the recent Stephen Sprouse project he completed at Louis Vuitton, or perhaps it's the fact that he now lives in Paris full time, but his Fall show was a big, juicy nostalgic kiss to a city that doesn't really exist anymore.</p><p>The show started simply enough, with a gray cardigan sweater and charcoal trousers, but when the model walked past, you saw the back half of a kilt and braces—Jacobs' new uniform—and knew it was going to get personal. He worked his way through little silver-and-black A-line shifts; party dresses in metallic leathers and floral brocades with flaring, full skirts and monster shoulders; velvet bustier tops and high-waisted over-dyed jeans; and Crayola-bright jackets, capes, and hooded coats. The only filter that separated these clothes from their East Village forebears was the expensive, luxury fabrics they came in. Every girl had a different hairdo, shellacked into Mohawks, flips, and bouffants, and the makeup was straight off the album cover of Duran Duran's <em>Rio</em>. The cumulative effect of all that color, volume, and optimism? One editor called it ""A Flock of Seagulls meets Alexis Carrington.""</p><p>Will fashion as outrageously ebullient as this—in some cases, make that just plain outrageous—sell in the harsh reality of the late aughts? (And talking about harsh: More than 1,000 people were nixed from the invitation list this season in a cost-cutting slash and burn.) Jacobs insists that he wasn't thinking about the economy when he was working on the collection, and maybe he wasn't. These days, wagering that women will splash out on feel-good clothes is as good a bet as any.</p></div>"
156,fall,2009,f2009,marchesa,"Lots of designers are talking escapism this week, but for Marchesa, dreamy flights of fancy are actually their stock-in-trade. And it was business as usual at the Chelsea Art Museum, where a dense crowd that included Natalia Vodianova, Diane Kruger, and Helena Christensen flowed, oohing and aahing, around tulle-swathed models perched on white cubes. ""I wanted the whole thing to be like a fairy tale,"" explained Marchesa's designer, Georgina Chapman. ""I wanted to have fantasy."" The 25 looks ably ran the gamut of what our millennial Cinderellas and Snow Whites (also known as A-listers) might clamor to wear. On offer was Marchesa's fail-safe classic Grecian in a fresh lilac; an elegant black gown with flat tulle tiers that looked like they were dipped in sequins; a cloud of black tulle over sequins belted with a ribbon bow; and the drama of a full-skirted pewter tulle gown embroidered with silver roses, topped with a bow on its bodice.</p><p>Balancing the seesaw of some dream-woven dresses that actually appeared to defy the laws of physics were two looks with black pants, something that Chapman insists she's always included. (We checked: She's right.) There was something quite striking about these lean matte trousers, one pair worn with a little peplum top and the other more dramatically shown with a draped chiffon tunic inset with a corset. But, striking or not, we have a feeling they'll be left aside when most of these confections are packed up for their trip to the Oscars this weekend.</p></div>"
157,fall,2009,f2009,marios-schwab,"One of the tests of really interesting fashion is whether you feel you've never seen anything quite like it before. Marios Schwab's Fall collection had that quality. It started from an intellectual investigation into various forms of expansion, running from the workings of the human body to the geological forms of crystals and minerals when they crack open, revealing themselves within stones. Nevertheless, you could read all that in the program notes and still get no idea of what the outcome would be in terms of clothes. As it was, Schwab's opening section of double-layer dresses—a larger size on top of a smaller size in a single silhouette—with half-circle Swarovski stones embedded in the necklines, looked great. They were followed by even more strangely dramatic pieces of tailoring and dresses in which fissures seemed to break open to reveal crystalline interiors. The technical rigor involved in cutting these pieces put Schwab back on track as one of the London designers who are pushing forward through lines of inquiry other than the standard historical references. It did lead him to offer a one-length collection that has only one end use—as cocktail party wear—but whoever chooses from this collection will own something exceptional.</p></div>"
158,fall,2009,f2009,mark-fast,"Another knitwear talent is on the loose from the Central Saint Martin's M.A., this time via Canada. He's Mark Fast, one of the two designers who passed the rigors of the New Generation selection committee this season. ""It's time for a rebellion against safeness. It's exciting to be a designer now,"" said Fast, who was charged up like many others in London by thinking about a powerful natural phenomenon as a symbol of the season: ""Thunderstorms. That moment of fear and negativity, mixed with something that also feels beautiful."" That was interesting as a zeitgeist-briefing, but what of the clothes? They were in the vein of body-con dressing that has been such a continuing theme in London. As well as subtle ladder stitches running over the contours of backs and hips, there were fringes made of combed viscose and boleros made of knitted velvet. If some of it had the cast of Azzedine Alaïa, who produced shapes not so far from this years ago, it was obvious this boy has something of his own, too, and will eventually make a product that can appeal to a broad constituency. At the moment, the length of the dresses really only makes them viable, outside of clubs, as T-shirts. As Fast's former professor, the straight-talking Louise Wilson, jokingly chided him backstage, ""They're a bit short, aren't they? Couldn't you have knitted four more rows?""</p></div>"
159,fall,2009,f2009,marni,"Marni for Fall was a rich, dark layering of texture and iridescence pulled together with a unique, brisk, and realistic elegance. Quite how Consuelo Castiglioni does this is hard to convey, because the list of components can read like a recipe for wild and eccentric confusion. For starters, there were mink earmuffs and trapper hats, fur mitts and ski gloves, goggle sunglasses, garlands of antiqued gold flowers, woolly checkered tights, and stacks of bangles. The clothes, too, were a description-defying conglomeration of fabric, fur, and knit: grid-patterned metallic brocade, plain felts, patchworked jacquards, evergreen fox, chintzy roses.</p><p>For all that, Castiglioni's deft handling of palette and proportion made this one of her most controlled collections yet, as well as a distinct step away from the loose-lined assemblages she often deals out. That was down to the simplicity of shape and the sporty elements woven into the mix. Squared-off boxy coats and tunic dresses were interspersed with subtle interpretations of jogging pants and parkas. One tweed coat with a fur panel in the back came with a protective parka shell to peel away and tie casually at the hips. In total, this qualifies as one of Milan's most inspiring collections, refreshingly carried off without a hint of backward-looking reference and considered in a way that achieved a rare balance between creativity and reality. These clothes don't demand any stretch of the imagination to see exactly how, and where, they'll be worn.</p></div>"
160,fall,2009,f2009,martin-grant,"Scaling back, Martin Grant presented a Fall collection on mannequins in his Marais atelier. He made a few nods toward the trends: a hooded sweatshirt minidress had this season's rock 'n' roll vibe, while both a gazar coat-dress and a skirtsuit with waist-shrinking tulle padding at the hips channeled the forties. (The jacket of the suit also boasted stand-up lapels and a built-in shell for a sleek line.) But these were more likely lucky coincidences than intentional grabs at nowness. Way before the recession had everyone in fashion talking about the importance of timelessness, this Australian transplant's calling cards were classics with an attention to special details. Today, those special details included an integrated belt on a strapless L.B.D. and jumpsuit, permanent pleats on the high-waisted trousers of a pantsuit, and swags of fabric suspended from the collar of a gorgeous silk blouse that added some controlled volume at the shoulders. There was nothing scaled back about the quality of these clothes.</p></div>"
161,fall,2009,f2009,mary-katrantzou,"For her debut runway collection, Mary Katrantzou jolted her audience—a packed house, at 9 a.m.—wide awake. As the recipient of New Generation funding, she used every resource to pull together an impressive development of the bold placement prints and jewelry she spent last season showing to buyers, gathering orders. Her motifs—simplified images of perfume bottles—packed a clean, colorful graphic punch and polish that belied the effort they had taken to assemble. ""I found a printer called the Silk Bureau here in London,"" she laughed. ""They do it in their garage.""</p><p>Last season, Katrantzou's first offerings were all in a single shift shape. Their newness and wearability won plenty of takers on sight, but some were left wondering whether, as a textile specialist, she'd be able to broaden her line into different silhouettes. Katrantzou delivered impressively, adding fluted skirts and new dress shapes, long-line tubes, and zippered suede pants. Better still, she raised the level of her other talent as a jewelry designer, layering on giant necklaces constructed from gold tubing, chains, and mirrors. Again, it was a question of a determined young woman using every resource at her disposal, including the help of her family in Athens. As Katrantzou explained backstage, ""My mother has a furniture-making factory. She's retired, but I forced her to get back in there and make me some pieces."" It may be about the toughest time to launch a business, but this is a young talent whose vision and attitude are, by every indication, just about perfectly adapted to make things happen for herself.</p></div>"
162,fall,2009,f2009,matthew-ames,"With the help of the Ecco Domani Fashion Foundation, Matthew Ames migrated his collection to New York from Paris for Fall. Although Ames, who was trained at the Art Institute of Chicago, described his palette (camel, loden, red) and fabrics (denim, Ultrasuede, corduroy) as ""classic American,"" the clothes had a very nomadic—and springlike—feel. This can be attributed to the way Ames let fabric fall around the body in garments that were constructed using as few seams as possible. ""I wanted to eliminate the unnecessary and focus on the essential,"" he said. While these clothes won't appeal to everyone—this collection really bucked the body-con trend—credit the designer with pursuing his own vision.</p></div>"
163,fall,2009,f2009,matthew-williamson,"Let the rest of the world have its basics in neutrals. Matthew Williamson is having none of it. ""You have to believe in your vision,"" said the designer after his show, which presented an exuberant thesis that there is still a place for his riot of color and embellishment—and a fun-loving lass to wear it. The latter was evident, of course, from his stylish fan club-cum-front row—Santigold, Trish Goff, Joy Bryant, and Zoe Kravitz, who pronounced the proceedings ""amazing"" and kept her sunglasses on throughout.</p><p>This designer shines brightest for summer, but here he applied himself to making the most of colder climes, bundling cocoonlike ombré coats over leather pants and spangled dresses, layering a tribal beaded tunic over a turtleneck knit, and turning the classic Fair Isle into a cozy twinset of coat and dress. He also used loads of fur—to good effect in the brightly dyed fox in fat stoles, less so in a royal blue coat with silver leather insets that was way over the top. To be honest, there were a few such moments—aren't there always in a Williamson show? But that was easily excused because the designer is clearly in a joyous career phase: an upcoming collaboration with H&amp;M, a possible menswear collection in the offing, and a new Meatpacking District boutique, which opened yesterday. ""Fantastic. Not bad,"" he said when asked about first-day sales. Chances are, it's not empty optimism. Williamson's London boutique just reported its best January in five years.</p></div>"
164,fall,2009,f2009,maurizio-pecoraro,"Maurizio Pecoraro is one of Milan's most baroque designers. He can't resist the romance of sequins, nor, ahem, the siren call of gold and silver Lurex. In a season of don't-mess-with-me biker babes, he really had a chance to drive home his uniquely frilled and furbelowed message—and the grand seventeenth-century Palazzo Litta, where his show was held, was well chosen to provide a helpful assist. A nail-studded charcoal gray suit and a black bubble coat with stiff ruffles curling down the front were among the most inventive pieces. But a strong hand with embellishments does not a cohesive statement make, and the clothes had a hard time living up to the extravagantly sumptuous setting. Until the finale, that is, when Pecoraro sent out a parade of models in sharp-looking tuxedo pants and embellished black or ivory blouses, each of them different and each a little gem.</p></div>"
165,fall,2009,f2009,max-azria,"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue…that's the saying Max Azria's collection evoked.</p><p><em>Something old:</em> Rather than mess with a winning formula, Max and Lubov Azria revisited draping, this time effectively layering goddess dresses—some in velvet, others in jersey—over body stockings and leggings to give them a harder, more futuristic Lara Croft edge. One of the prettiest was a plum chiffon gown with an asymmetrical hem and attached scarf that flowed like water.</p><p><em>Something new:</em> Fresher was the Victorian tinge. ""We fell in love with a piece of lace,"" Lubov said, by way of explanation. The material added texture and a snowy delicateness to the collection.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""8pb2ro""></div></div><p><em>Something borrowed:</em> The more structured looks that opened the show (carapacelike corsets and toppers with inverted-triangle silhouettes) could have been seen at the Azrias' Hervé Léger show earlier this week.</p><p><em>Something blue:</em> The brand attracts some big names, as Alicia Keys (in the audience tonight) and Angelina Jolie could attest. The image of Angelina at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in a sea blue Max Azria dress from Spring still resonates. It was quite an endorsement.</p><p>The unifying goal for Fall, according to Lubov, was to make women feel strong and confident—and, as the program notes put it, to ""explore the ethereal seduction of the dark side."" That's a tall order, and one that the Azrias only partly fulfilled. Still, there were points of light.</p></div>"
166,fall,2009,f2009,max-mara,"At the tail end of Milan fashion week, it was refreshing to witness a collection that made no reference to the eighties. The more obvious trend-driven route is one the MaxMara team might've gone as recently as last season, but for now it looks as though they're making a concerted effort to return to the brand's roots. Subtle luxury being this label's original stock in trade, the emphasis today was on classics—coats, above all, in sumptuous fabrics like cashmere, alpaca, and camel's hair. (The company also introduced Atelier, a new limited-edition line of coats earlier in the week.)</p><p>If you're shopping for a trench come fall, MaxMara could just be your go-to house. But there were other keepers as well, in particular a tobacco-brown coat in double-face cashmere with deeply cuffed short kimono sleeves. Attention was paid to the neckline of jackets: Slightly oversize boyfriend blazers in charcoal and beige distinguished themselves by their tucked-under lapels; other single- and double-breasted options wrapped around the neck almost like scarves.</p><p>The show wasn't entirely free of styling tricks—silk slips peeking below the hems of otherwise office-ready dresses and Amelia Earhart-worthy fur bonnets being the two most notable offenders. But overall, this collection showed MaxMara playing to its strengths.</p></div>"
167,fall,2009,f2009,meadham-kirchhoff,"So many designers are chasing the dark, street, biker vibe this season that it requires someone who really believes in it full-time to make something above, beyond, and spine-tinglingly special of it. In London, it took Ed Meadham and Benjamin Kirchhoff to figuratively get on their bikes and drive the possibilities through conceptually structured bombers and split-knee pants all the way to gold military embroidery and jeweled trousers. Extraordinarily, it then ended up with Manolo Blahnik boots entwined with what almost looked like the contents of an estate jewelry vault. ""It is,"" they say, ""a metaphor for insane desire.""</p><p>Meadham and Kirchhoff have been on a slow burn for the past few seasons, developing frayed jeans, destroyed lace, and street-elegant jackets in sync with, and sometimes ahead of, the likes of Christophe Decarnin at Balmain and Andreas Melbostad at Phi. It takes time to refine something as difficult to invent as an anatomically shaped, articulated pant, but this season their research came to fruition. The fold-back openings at the knee have now taken on a new hybrid dimension, creating the illusion of boots linked to cycling shorts. As for the gold and silver rococo embroidery, the designers were careful to steer the effects well clear of bling-tastic tackiness by balancing the aesthetic with frayed-edge cheesecloth shirting, felted striped Breton sweaters, and asymmetrically cut black bombers. They may have been in their dark place for years, but this season is Meadham and Kirchhoff's moment to shine.</p></div>"
168,fall,2009,f2009,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors knows how to take a theme and run with it. One season it's Ali MacGraw's 1970's; more recently it was <em>Mad Men</em>. But for Fall, it's not about a movie, or a TV show; it's about…real life. In his program notes, Kors riffed about ""neo-classics,"" and on the runway there were clothes for corporate boardroom types, anchorwomen, and plenty of other gals for whom real life involves rocking a black fur sleeveless coat from time to time.</p><p>Tailoring was a focus. As if to prove that he can sniff out a trend, the designer tossed in a few jackets of the sort that have been making the rounds this week—some short-sleeved with squared-off, tucked shoulders; others with cutouts around the lapels. But Kors was at his strongest when he was thinking sleek: elongating, stretch gabardine cigarette trousers; a pantsuit almost as narrow as the chalk stripes on its charcoal flannel; double-face peacoats and balmacaans.</p><p>In a nod to the prevailing mood, he skipped long dresses entirely, favoring knee-grazing, one-shoulder numbers in matte sequins. Kors also thumbed his nose at the global gods of finance, whipping up shredded fox jackets and coats in neon pink, caution orange, and acid green. Those may be pretty hard to rationalize on a need basis. But as this savvy designer knows, that will make a certain type of woman want one all the more.</p></div>"
169,fall,2009,f2009,milly,"According to the program notes, designer Michelle Smith views herself as her own muse each season. If her growing business is any indication—Milly recently opened an in-shop boutique at Harrods, and Jill Biden wore a houndstooth Milly shift on Inauguration Day, sparking a spike in sales—she has good taste. The cool-creative style of New York's galleristas was the jumping-off point for her latest effort, but the focus, as always, was on striking a balance between versatility and wearability. The designer had fun with tweed, turning out a rubberized swing coat and wool separates shot through with gold thread. The short cocktail frock, Milly's bread and butter, turned up in velvet with a pleated silk collar, in fringed micro-tweed, and in an incarnation bearing tassel embroidery. OK, there weren't too many new ideas here, but if ain't broken, why fix it?</p></div>"
170,fall,2009,f2009,miss-sixty,"Rufus Wainwright was on one side of the aisle; Kristen Bell, Minka Kelly, and Mischa Barton on the other. But once the lights went down and the bass kicked in, all eyes were on Sasha, Jessica, and Karlie stomping down the catwalk in one street-sweet getup after another. Skinny acid-wash jeans, patterned tights, graphic tops (""Do you like what you see?"" one coyly asked), and shiny, shiny jumpsuits rounded out the denim label's Fall offering. This parade was inspired, according to the liner notes, ""by the strength, vitality, and optimism"" of the eighties—three things we could all use a lot of.</p></div>"
171,fall,2009,f2009,missoni,"Like other designers this season, Angela Missoni has been thinking hard about her brand's roots. In the case of <em>famiglia</em> Missoni, of course, that means knitwear. A video of a working loom played on a giant screen behind the runway, but the designer hardly needed digital assistance to underscore her message. It was plain for all to see in the way she piled on the knits. Take the opening look: We counted a waistcoat, a boxy man's jacket, a mohair cardigan scarf, a slipdress, a miniskirt, a hooded scarf, and legwarmers. The multilayered hippie-meets-hip-hop look will be tricky to pull off anywhere south of the polar ice cap (photo shoots excepted), but taken in smaller doses, these are the kind of cozy, feel-good clothes that actually have a chance of selling in the new economy. The luminous color palette—pearly pink, peach, and gold lamé punched up with cerulean blue—certainly helped in that department.</p><p>Who wouldn't want to hunker down in one of Missoni's clever cardigan scarves? The models wore them loose, with the ends nearly trailing along the floor; wound around your neck, they'd make a coat redundant. And because even—or perhaps especially—in dire times a girl needs to go out now and then, Missoni added delicate, spiderweb-y dresses (shades of Rodarte) to the mix. Pair them with a slip and you'd have a sweet, unexpected party look. As if to prove the point, Angela's daughter Margherita wore one sitting in the front row.</p></div>"
172,fall,2009,f2009,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada wrapped up fashion month with a compelling Miu Miu collection that, like more than a few others this season, felt quintessentially Parisian. With bits and pieces from <em>Histoire d'O</em>, Visconti's <em>Conversation Piece</em>, and Fassbinder and Antonioni films on the soundtrack, it tried to answer the question, ""What's the bourgeoisie now?"" Or so the designer explained backstage, adding, ""they were different kinds of femmes fatales.""</p><p>The opening coat-dresses, most of them sleeveless, were worn half unbuttoned, exposing flesh-toned brassieres. Either that, or the dresses were draped in back, revealing bare expanses of skin a-shimmer from light dustings of iridescent glitter. A strategically draped long scarf edged in fur, meanwhile, might stand in for a missing shirt. Prada sent out coats and dresses made from what could've been upholstery fabric salvaged from the tony Avenue Foch manse where the show was held, then moved on to looks that paired filmy silk blouses with long, narrow skirts (the most striking combination came in turquoise and ruby). Toward the end, she put aside the underwear fetish that was a through line with her signature collection (in Milan it was red briefs) to show sleeveless shells and skirts in silk crepe embroidered with large, colorful gems.</p><p>The nude bras, furry heels, and paillette-covered kneesocks gave the vaguely seventies-feeling clothes an erotic subtext. But sexually charged undercurrents aside, what this Miu Miu outing boiled down to was a collection of great-looking, salable coats.</p></div>"
173,fall,2009,f2009,monique-lhuillier,"For the first time in ten seasons, Monique Lhuillier broke with her usual 30-some looks at Bryant Park in favor of a mini-presentation at the Plaza's Oak Room. As the designer explained, there's the economy, but there's also the looming Oscars. (The gown guru is headed back west shortly.)</p><p>Lhuillier's brat pack of eleven models sat or stood in gossipy clusters, like petulant girls bored at an adult's party. The designer wanted to address both sides of our recessionary needs. The collection, themed Modern Ballets Russes, had a lot of that ""something special"" that many designers now believe is key. There were horsehair-stiffened skirts on full dresses and, of course, embroideries aplenty—one froth fest of a gown definitely suffered from a surfeit of specialness. Meanwhile, quieter pieces—like an open-back black silk jersey column (very Tilda in Lanvin)—could be accessorized umpteen different ways. <em>Et voilà</em>, value!</p><p>The edgy styling with its artfully snagged body stockings and tangles of necklaces added an interesting layer to Lhuillier's wholly unedgy vibe, but ultimately it was distracting, and it became hard to tell what the dresses will really look like. That and the fact that there are apparently 20 more looks back at the showroom really mess with a pundit's red-carpet betting. Well, I'll venture a guess anyway. My money's on an elegant navy jersey number with copper paillettes and a keyhole cutout. Are you listening, Angelina?</p></div>"
174,fall,2009,f2009,moschino,"Rosella Jardini's Fall show began simply enough with a navy collarless cocoon coat, its sleeves embroidered with rosettes. But what would a Moschino show be without the trademark tricks of the eye? Enter a pair of slim wool trousers overlaid in black organza cut in the shape of jodhpurs. A smart double-breasted wool coat, meanwhile, was topped by a sheer layer of fabric with the floppy consistency of a bathrobe. The veiling technique, Jardini's show notes argued, made for two looks in one—on the coat, for example, the organza is detachable. That might seem to suggest double value for the customer, but in reality the sight gag distracted from the otherwise classic clothes. More successful was a party dress with silver embroidery that on closer inspection cleverly revealed itself to be thousands of small safety pins lined up in neat, orderly rows. And when she sent out a series of dresses with red velvet flower appliqués caged in chiffon, Jardini was firmly in control of her signature whimsy.</p></div>"
175,fall,2009,f2009,moschino-cheap-chic,"Rosella Jardini's show notes promised ""surrealism and ruffles, with humor."" The surrealism came in the form of belts that stayed in place despite being permanently unbelted, pearls that looked like they were ready to spill from their ropes but never did, and shoes that were part pump, part sandal depending on your viewing angle. The ruffles were absolutely everywhere— as a photo print on a trench, spilling down one side of a black pencil skirt in Schiaparelli pink, or at the collar of a marigold bubble coat. As for the humor element? It had its moments, as in a party dress bisected by two black ribbons that gave new meaning to the phrase ""tied with a bow."" But it just wasn't a big enough idea to sustain the collection, which, though charming at times, ended up feeling slightly repetitive.</p></div>"
176,fall,2009,f2009,mulberry,"The Cure's single ""A Forest"" (""Come closer and see, see into the trees, find the girl while you can…"") played at Mulberry's Snow White-themed presentation at Soho House, which featured a woodsy, apple-strewn set—as well as a reluctant canine model, hired for the purpose of showcasing the house's new range of dog accessories. Two-legged creatures are likely to be enthusiastic about the colorful clothes, bags, and shoes on offer. Creative director Emma Hill smartly stayed focused, showing a niche collection that had English charm aplenty. With the aim of capturing a ""Jackie Onassis meets Miss Jean Brodie"" feeling, a navy suit jacket with a built-in bow was paired with a tulip skirt. There was an abundance of outerwear (a logical brand extension for an accessories house), including leather poacher and bomber jackets, and, amusingly among the set's branches and bark, lumberjack plaids. This was a happy case where you could see the forest for the trees.</p></div>"
177,fall,2009,f2009,naeem-khan,"""It's not Russian, it's Indian,"" said Naeem Khan at his civilized Fall presentation in his now year-old showroom, pointing out the embroidered swirl of Kashmiri paisleys covering a grand opera coat. (As he tells it, the piece took 40 people almost two weeks to make.) Actually, there was a sort of sartorial Eastern itinerary happening here, from the Muscovite chic of fox-trimmed gilets and luxurious skirts to the more blurred (but decidedly east of Greece) origins of a Poiret-esque kimono coat and emerald velvet caftan. Most exciting were the richly worked separates (for which Khan says there's increasing demand). Unlike a gown, these can be worn over and over and in umpteen different ways. But when it came to serious evening, Khan's approach was pure American glamour, with standouts such as a silver paillette dress that looked like it was made of crushed glass, a smoky brown chiffon number encrusted with hunks of crystal, and a white tulle goddess dress with an elaborate necklace halter. Just don't expect to see any of them this Sunday night, as Khan has opted out of the red-carpet races. ""It's just too tight this time,"" he said. ""It's the retailers or the Oscars."" Ironically, this is the first season he's working with perennial Oscar commenter, stylist Mary Alice Stephenson. But no matter—it must be a happy partnership, because this was one of Khan's strongest collections.</p></div>"
178,fall,2009,f2009,nanette-lepore,"Shades of raspberry and grape showed up alongside mustard and dark teal in Nanette Lepore's vibrant and print-heavy palette, and—not to leave anything out—accessories got the leopard treatment, with sequins and paillettes playing supporting roles, too. The clothes themselves were much less memorable than the colors they were rendered in. In fact, the piece that left the most lasting impression was an all-black coat with a fishtail hem (uneven hemlines being a recurring theme). It had a simplicity and, hence, wearability that was lacking in the collection's more frivolous looks.</p></div>"
179,fall,2009,f2009,narciso-rodriguez,"For Michelle Obama watchers, Narciso Rodriguez's Fall show started auspiciously. The khaki color of the first wool twill coat that came down the runway and the fitted jacket and legging pant that followed it echoed the ensemble he created for our First Lady to wear on inauguration weekend. But anybody who came hoping to see some sort of White House wardrobe left disappointed. Rodriguez is too subtle and savvy a designer for something like that.</p><p>The show marked his return to the Bryant Park tents, where he hadn't been on the schedule since 2005 (in between, he helped pioneer Chelsea as a fashion week scene). People who've followed his career will have observed the reappearance of one or two motifs, starting with the sporty, scubalike detailing of a black hooded knit bodysuit worn with an equally clingy skirt. Fall also found him continuing to experiment with bold color. This season it's highlighter yellow and pink—somewhat challenging shades, but certainly timely—in stretch knit dresses with graphic cutouts or in silk overlaid with black lace. Even more unexpected were the black and white camouflage pieces accessorized with storm-trooper hats with slits for the models' eyes. As comments about the dangerous times we're living in, they made a sort of sense, even if they didn't really jibe with an aesthetic that is, above all, about cool, graphic minimalism.</p><p>Rodriguez and his investors at Liz Claiborne parted ways last October; losing your backing, especially in a market like this, is no doubt a source of distraction. Perhaps because of that, this collection didn't quite have the wow factor of his recent outings.</p></div>"
180,fall,2009,f2009,nathan-jenden,"The show was called ""Frostbite,"" an oblique reference, perhaps, to the collection's chilly dominatrix edge, like Robert Palmer's video vixens filed to a much sharper point. And if that suggests the eighties, then Prince singing ""Erotic City"" on the soundtrack sealed the deal. Anyway, that's the magic decade for Jenden, to the point where a full-skirted white dress with a lace effect looked like something Cyndi Lauper might have gone formal in. Otherwise, the clothes were mostly black, fitted, and folded to the body. A fishnet body stocking was the foundation for a zippered dress whose precise folds looked like origami, or a trompe l'oeil layering of a man's eveningwear. There was a bandage dress (not for the first time in this eighties-infatuated season) in gray with a hint of Lurex, and a bondage outfit in a strap-draped bird's-eye jacket and pants. Other eighties touches: the huge zips that bifurcated dresses and tops, the multi-pleated pants tapering to the ankle. The mystery of ""Frostbite"" may have been solved, Rosebud-like, by the arrival of two dresses—a puffball, a trapeze—whose cutouts made the wearers look like giant mutant snowflakes. Yikes!</p></div>"
181,fall,2009,f2009,nicole-miller,"Nicole Miller has grown a more successful business than many of the other designers showing this week, and tonight's collection made it clear why. One frock after another, in sequined geometric patterns or elaborate pintucks, would work equally well whether you're pushing 25 or 45. Working with a more subdued palette than usual (""Everyone thinks of me as the color person!"" Miller joked backstage), the designer experimented with lacquered fabrics that yielded standout faux-leather and velour biker jackets. In an era in which Michelle Obama moves more clothing than an Olsen twin, Miller's sophisticated-but-fun wares feel just right.</p></div>"
182,fall,2009,f2009,nina-ricci,"The show might have been his swan song at Nina Ricci, but Olivier Theyskens saw it through with a fierce, surreal poetry no one who witnessed it will forget. Vastly tall, his strong-shouldered women were walking, trancelike, on what looked like an impossibility: a laced-up platform ankle boot with a sickle-shaped hole at the back. No heels at all. Their clothes—everything from strangely flowing pants to incredibly cut suits to probably the best black leather jacket in Paris and evening dresses with swooping, furling skirts—were a tour de force. Between the strange atmosphere, the supersharp, almost Mugler-esque jackets, and the sculpted forms, it rounded up everything fashion-watchers have known Theyskens is capable of, and went even further.</p><p>""I was thinking of a nocturnal mood,"" he said backstage, trying to explain how he'd orchestrated it. ""Not nightclubbing at all. Something moonlit—a bit magical."" Oddly enough, it wasn't melancholy and never lapsed into the costumey gothic mindset Theyskens once inhabited. Instead, the collection was a proud—if not exactly defiant—series of reminders of the chic, precise way he used to cut a jacket when he was running his own line, a flashback to the corseted lingerie he perfected at Rochas, and an underscoring of the genius he has applied to making grand event dresses during his tenure at Ricci. Backstage, Theyskens was gracious and smiling as he received sincere congratulations for an outing that showcased all his talents, offered many things for many women to wear for many occasions, and was thereby the most mature and salable collection he's designed to date. Quite why he saved his best till last is a mystery, but Ricci's management may just be kicking itself for letting him go.</p></div>"
183,fall,2009,f2009,ohne-titel,"For their latest effort, Alexa Adams and Flora Gill carried over some of the ideas and techniques (a focus on the body, drapey knits) that have won the duo critical acclaim in seasons past. ""For Fall, we wanted to keep certain elements, but going in a darker direction,"" Gill said before the show. There were beautiful stretch-wool blazers with cowl-necks, as well as a subtle ""chain mail"" knit that yielded some covetable sweaters and body-con dresses. But were there enough new ideas here to make the audience sit up and take note? By the fourth incarnation of a cropped silk biker jacket, it was difficult to answer in the affirmative.</p></div>"
184,fall,2009,f2009,organic-by-john-patrick,"The setup for John Patrick's Organic presentation fell into place when he settled on his venue, the lower level of a Garment District church. ""I thought, 'What happens in church basements? Bake sales!' "" he said. Against one wall, a group of farmers from Patrick's upstate hometown offered attendees local cheese samples, seed packets, and literature on the benefits of sustainable practices.</p><p>If Spring's girl had an Okie spirit, her Fall counterpart is a strong, modern twenty-first-century woman. There were scuba-inspired body-con minis and a sleeveless trenchdress made from a recycled polyester treated to look like beaver fur. If that sounds like a departure, it still felt ""100 Percent Organic."" The clothes had charm, and the focus remained centered on the company's ethical practices: the use of sustainable materials and the team of cottage-industry workers Patrick employs in Peru. Designers frequently offer clothing with no real relevancy to the world we inhabit. It's refreshing to see someone approach their work as part of a greater whole.</p></div>"
185,fall,2009,f2009,oscar-de-la-renta,"""Mercy, Mercy Me"" played on repeat at Oscar de la Renta. It doesn't pay to read too much into such details, but we don't need Marvin Gaye to tell us that ""things ain't what they used to be."" On the upside, there's the new administration; and on the down, well, we all know about the down. For de la Renta, though, the negative will never be a notion worth entertaining. So what if the markets performed another nosedive earlier this week? The designer is resolutely staying the upper-crust, polished course, from the tippy top of his models' grand, Keira Knightley-in-<em>The Duchess</em> updos to their gold-shod feet.</p><p>The show opened with a black double-faced wool dress, accessorized with a black and white skunk scarf and mittens that suggested de la Renta might be willing to dial down the luxury—skunk being quite a bit less swanky than, say, fox. But not a chance. Hallmarks like texture, surface embellishment, and color are just as key this season as they've ever been. Witness a smashing lamé leopard dress, an embroidered gold jacquard coat, and an aubergine silk wool suit worn with a red charmeuse blouse. (Although an almost minimal-by-comparison black wool skirtsuit gets high marks, too.)</p><p>De la Renta is one of the few designers this week who has really gone there in terms of grand evening. His stunners came in the subtle variety—a black silk off-the-shoulder column cinched with a metallic belt, for instance—and the not so subtle, as in the pair of strapless crinoline gowns that closed the show. In the face of so much turmoil, there was something about all that netting that was fabulously defiant.</p></div>"
186,fall,2009,f2009,ossie-clark,"The Ossie Clark oeuvre is so well known and cherished by vintage-loving girls (and has been so thoroughly referenced and re-referenced by others since he died) that it's been tough for the label to find its bearings since it was bought by the entrepreneur Marc Worth. For the first couple of seasons, house designer Avsh Alom Gur seemed to vacillate over whether he should do his own thing or dare to approximate Ossie-style raised-waist seventies moss-crepe dresses and bring back the distinctive things the designer did with sleeves and bias cut. For Fall, Gur finally seemed to get a grip and focus on the seventies familiars—the only policy that could possibly give a point to the line. He did his best job yet of working with archive templates, turning out fluted empire-line day dresses with trumpet or balloon sleeves in the kinds of petrol blues and maroons that were Ossie signatures and huge sellers in their day under the Radley label. Separates in the flattering form of flippy, paneled knee-length skirts and satin blouses also worked, and one swirly, tiered long chiffon dress came the nearest Gur has gotten to capturing some of the hippie-era magic Clark personified. The issue still is whether this line is best projected on a runway. It's a label that ought to quietly stay in its own seventies groove rather than try to be part of the seasonal trend discussion.</p></div>"
187,fall,2009,f2009,paul-smith,"""No theme, just classic English things: a parka, a rose print, Fair Isle, houndstooth, tweed."" That was Paul Smith's summary of his latest women's collection. But just as classically English is an eccentric touch: The first outfit featured a Fair Isle sweater dress, a leopard-print scarf, a wide-brimmed hat with a long feather, and a pink-strapped satchel. Or how about an army jacket over a khaki shirt over a lace skirt over leggings? Or a green wool jacket with hot pink epaulets? That particular—and not particularly pleasing—combination of colors dominated the first half of the show. Then the Smith woman enlisted. The designer showed an army sweater dress and an officer's coat-dress and a floor-sweeper for evening in army green. Yards of beads and crystals were trailed through epaulets as a way of dressing up military-influenced basics. Such ingenuity in hard times brought to mind Bevis Hillier's <em>Austerity/Binge</em>, an early seventies book that was hugely influential in inspiring a reevaluation of postwar style. There was a lot of that style in this collection (a rose-printed mac with a matching full skirt certainly updated the aesthetic), but it still didn't make it entirely clear what Paul Smith's womenswear is supposed to be, beyond an exploration of fashion and personal history.</p></div>"
188,fall,2009,f2009,peter-jensen,"Peter Jensen has the sort of charm that little girls—tweenagers and even those a bit older who like to believe in the value of naiveté in a naughty world—particularly cherish. Watching one of his shows is like sitting down in junior high to listen to the next episode in a somewhat nutty Scandinavian storybook. This season, Jensen's tale is about his Aunt Jytte, who, he relates, ""owned a chip shop and cab company in the capital of Nuuk, Greenland, and liked fashion in the seventies."" He dedicated this collection to her ""because the Danish government paid for me to go to Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to research.""</p><p>That's how the folkloric cross-stitch patterns, beaded capes, blanket plaids, and white boots ended up layered into this cozily playful agglomeration of padded jackets, woolly double-bobble hats, over-blouses, and white miniskirts. (This last item was a fashion must the marvelous Aunt Jytte insisted on wearing, according to her admiring nephew, ""even if her tights were freezing to her legs."") Much of the detail, the designer insists, is faithful to authentic regional national costume, down to the hand-knitted sock-hats, which are a tradition in the far-flung Faeroes. What it amounted to wasn't an earthshaking contribution to the future of fashion but more of a dressing-up menu for innocents abroad, especially when a chilly spell hits. No harm at all in that, especially as Jensen's prices are quite accessible to well-behaved girls who save up their allowance.</p></div>"
189,fall,2009,f2009,peter-pilotto,"Peter Pilotto and his subtle, colorful prints and form-flattering drape are the talk of London, and not just because people are beginning to drop his name. All week, women—buyers, editors, creative directors—wearing pieces of his Spring collection have been bumping into one another at dinners, parties, and up and down front rows. Pilotto is selling like mad, and no one minds: His appreciators are just very happy to watch a talent come forward, and support it.</p><p>Pilotto is one of those whose thoughts have turned, this season, to the massive, fundamental events of natural history (maybe because it shrinks our current human anxieties to a minuscule blip). He and his partner, Christopher De Vos, an ex-Vivienne Westwood designer, say they've been working around ""the awe and wonder of the big bang theory, an optimistic new beginning."" Pilotto developed the prints and textures (stripes derived from digital manipulation of photos of fur and reptile skin), built up silk tufted tops tipped with paint to mimic ""an erupting volcano,"" and created chunky embroidery from geometric plastic paillettes. De Vos, whose responsibility is shape, worked out variations on the internal-draping tricks he's made his signature, and oversaw the development of the hourglass camel coat that was the best piece of tailoring on their runway. This will doubtless be the season when Pilotto and De Vos (who met at Antwerp's Royal Academy of Fine Arts in 2000) break through from the early adopters to a more mainstream crowd.</p></div>"
190,fall,2009,f2009,peter-som,"It wasn't clear how Peter Som would move forward after the recent split from his financial backer, so it was a relief to hear that he was going to be on the schedule this season after all. For his self-financed capsule collection, shown by appointment, he stayed true to form. Like many designers these days, Som is returning if not to basics then to what he loves best: in his case, mixing textures and patterns while exploring ""the clash of delicate/feminine with bold and graphic."" So a splashy print dress was paired with a tiger-stenciled mink, and a mossy green tweed coat featured fluoro trim. This collection of Som's ""favorite things"" didn't necessarily evolve the designer's aesthetic, but it reinforced the case that he is the go-to man for U.E.S. types who don't want to look all matchy-matchy Blair Waldorf. The upbeat lineup, which was ladylike without being stiff, and full of optimistic color and tactile interest, reminded us why we're happy Som is part of the New York scene.</p></div>"
191,fall,2009,f2009,phi,"Fashion has finally caught up with Phi. Andreas Melbostad has been working the badass eighties vibe—with sophistication and finesse—for several seasons now. Each show draws a more stellar front row, attesting to the relevance of the designer's sexy take on engineered dressing.</p><p>""You know I love my textures,"" Melbostad commented prior to a show that featured lots of zippered leather, sequins, corsetry details, color-blocking (inspired by Richard Lindner's paintings), and the collaging of classic utilitarian pieces like biker, bomber, and aviator jackets into substantial, iconic-looking outerwear. (The refashioned creepers that accessorized the show added a nice of-the-moment touch.) ""We really wanted to move strongly forward despite the economy,"" the designer said. ""These times make you feel very strongly about what you represent. What we stand for is a tough urban idea but with attention to finishings, cut, and quality."" All of this was effectively communicated, even if the show had too many variants on Melbostad's chosen themes. Still, aerodynamic second-skin aviator dresses and come-hither (but don't-mess-with-me) leggings are sure to fly at retail, as are his leather pieces.</p><p>Melbostad has accomplished a lot in his short tenure at Phi. Now that the pack has caught up with him, his challenge will be to stay a step ahead in seasons to come.</p></div>"
192,fall,2009,f2009,philosophy,"""Sweet rock,"" said Alberta Ferretti at the presentation for her Philosophy collection, where half the crowd mingled, Champagne in hand, and the other half lined the T-shaped wooden runway three deep to catch one of the four consecutive shows. As she has before, Ferretti explored the idea of cutting Philosophy's natural sweetness with a masculine edge. The look was layered to the hilt: skinny knits over dresses over sheer, slim pants. And over that went a coat: a hybridized, multi-fabric beast that included boiled gray wool, poor-boy rib, and long-haired black fur. The dusty-hued dresses were also crafted from various materials, pieced together in a way that made it hard to tell where one thing started and another stopped. The rock reference here was mostly grunge (who else wore ribbed arm warmers?), but a silver suit and gold-soled wedges were undeniably glam. As for the sweetness, it might be challenging for the Philosophy girl to pull out her ethereal fave, but kudos to Ferretti for not playing it safe.</p></div>"
193,fall,2009,f2009,pollini,"Jonathan Saunders has now had a chance to get his feet under the table at Pollini. Last season, he said he'd only had a couple of weeks to prepare his debut show, and this season proved that he's working out what the identity of a house that has its origins in traditional Italian footwear might be. He took a couple of Pollini heritage products—its riding boots and a baroque-print silk scarf—as a starting point for a small collection that brought some of the energy of London design to the Milan runway. Equestrian-themed jackets caught the big-shouldered silhouette of the moment, paired with surreal-heeled suede and leather riding-boot derivatives. Best were Saunders' cute interpretations of the scarf motif—curlicued scrolls used on little silk print dresses or cut out and appliquéd on cashmere shifts—evidence of his talent as a textile designer.</p></div>"
194,fall,2009,f2009,ports-1961,"Tia Cibani journeyed to India this season, and while her palette of amber and azure made for an appealing spectacle, her interpretation of the subcontinent's aesthetic heritage felt too literal at times. The traditional <em>angarkha</em> coat that opened the show, for example, fell awkwardly on the model's frame. There were some more inspiring moments: A chic wool coat in moonstone gray revealed only a peek at a gold lamé skirt underneath, striking just the right balance in a collection that elsewhere leaned too heavily toward the obvious.</p></div>"
195,fall,2009,f2009,prabal-gurung,"""Clothes for a thinking-man's sex symbol,"" is how Prabal Gurung described his debut collection. ""You know, Zadie Smith or Arundhati Roy—if they went there a little,"" he said with a wry smile. However, there's more than the thought of novelists in smart-sexy cocktail frocks for Gurung to smile about. After the shuttering of Bill Blass, where he worked for the past five years, Gurung has set out on his own—potentially a scary place to be right now. Happily, his packed Thursday night presentation proved that he has the support of important industry folk and friends, particularly those like casting agent James Scully and stylist Tina Laakkonen, both of whom pitched in to help. As for the clothes, there was more than a whiff of Monsieur Saint Laurent—another designer who dressed the sexy yet empowered set, and whom Gurung calls his ""guru.""</p><p>Blass closed in December, but this impressive first outing was clearly more than a few months in the making. The 21 looks—which made a bold statement in black, white, and red—fell mostly into elegant evening, with variations on Le Smoking in cropped pants and little jackets, and sharply graphic cocktail frocks. They were also unabashedly luxe, with such extravagances as double-faced cashmere, hand-sewn feathers, and embroideries done in India. But Gurung, who explained that dresses will retail for around $2,200, is unbowed. ""I just want to do beautiful, well-made clothes,"" he said. Godspeed.</p></div>"
196,fall,2009,f2009,prada,"One thing's for certain: Miuccia Prada is not going to the eighties disco for Fall. Instead, her collection seemed to be a call for austerity measures, if that's what you can read into boiled wool forties-style coats and suits, clothes that might have been appropriated from domestic upholstery fabric, and (possibly for women going back to the land for survival) kinky fishing waders. It was a bizarre take on utility even Prada found hard to explain. ""I didn't want to do anything about the city,"" she said, ""more something about sport and the outdoors in general—freedom and nature. But in the end, I realized I liked coats and suits. It was serious, in a way. It was about a need for feminine empowerment."" Prada's women, with their violently frizzed-up hair, certainly had a disconcerting look about them as they advanced, with red-rimmed glitter-ringed eyes catching the light with a nearly malevolent glint. What they were wearing was constructed from substantial tweed and stiff leather, slit to reveal sexually incendiary flashes of naked leg and red knit underwear.</p><p>As is entirely normal in the Miuccia Prada universe, any easy reading of narrative or reference was thrown off at every turn. Some of the strangeness was in the search for new volumes, swinging heavily from the shoulder in triangular, sometimes fur-laden shapes, or pinched into peplums by narrow, mannish leather belts. The footwear—wide-topped leather boots or velvet heels with Mohawk patent fringing at the heel—only added to the oddness of it all. In the end, however, it was not so disorientating and experimental that Prada codes weren't also fully exercised. The tweedy tailoring, fur, paillette embroidery, and, of course, the bags (now in plain businesslike leather or, for evening, an update of last winter's novelty sequin) have been staples for years. Even though Miuccia Prada might be considered one of fashion's out-there thinkers, this is still clearly a time to keep the brand fires burning.</p></div>"
197,fall,2009,f2009,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Preen's ""Power"" dress has been popping up more and more on young Hollywood starlets, and its snug fit, cutouts, and ultrahigh hem provided a continuing template for a sexy, spot-on Fall collection that designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi said was influenced by <em>Quadrophenia</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em>. The former inspired the mod A-line shapes of a few shifts and the oversize black-and-white houndstooth of the coats, some of which were accented with big hunks of black Mongolian lamb. The latter movie's Sean Young character, ""an android who didn't know she was an android,"" was the model for the fit-and-flare apron looks.</p><p>In the end, though, this show was really all about the body-con dresses. Cutouts are Fall's first big trend, and Preen has pushed the concept further than any of the look's proponents so far. Many of the pieces won't, ahem, cut it in the real world. A leather dress with slits below the bust, at the waist, and up and down both sides is fit only for the inside of a very dark club. And global warming or not, there's nothing practical about a jacket with rib-shaped holes in the back, although sans cutouts its strong shoulders and sharp lines would make it a fast seller. Without a doubt, the collection's less aggressive numbers will have legs. It won't be a surprise when the frocks that closed the show, with their swirls of rainbow-bright stretch hammered silk and white mesh insets, land on the red carpet.</p></div>"
198,fall,2009,f2009,pringle-of-scotland,"Clare Waight Keller must be thrilled when Spring is behind her and she can start to work on Fall—Pringle of Scotland has such a long history in knits, after all. Today the creative director exploited the house's know-how to make some beauties, including two very different cardigans—one in a chunky cashmere chain-link cable knit and the other in merino wool densely embroidered with cashmere loops and fish-scale sequins. She also found believable ways to incorporate fashion's current fascination with a strong shoulder. Witness a boxy, somewhat oversize jacket that married traditional menswear fabric in front with a ribbed knit in back, as well as a handmade dress with foxtail fur sleeves.</p><p>But when Waight Keller moved away from sweater dressing and tailoring, the collection lost focus. It was hard to connect the dots between the Donegal tweeds, Prince of Wales checks, and all the charcoal cashmere that opened the show and the pheasant-feather chubby and skirt that closed it. She'd be smarter to skip the plays for editorial attention and really hone in on the luxuriously understated investment pieces that are the brand's raison d'être—one, incidentally, that's more relevant than ever in a season like this.</p></div>"
199,fall,2009,f2009,proenza-schouler,"Modern, sexy, and utterly cool. Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez jolted the fashion flock out of its recession fatigue tonight, delivering a knockout collection full of directional yet wearable luxe clothes. The show began with outerwear: Camel wool twill coats and jackets inset with black, some with fur collars, looked like more relatable versions of the conceptual, deconstructed toppers they did last year. These were followed by cozy-chic tweeds. Example: a bomber tossed over a marled turtleneck tucked into cuffed shorts and cabled tights (a look spotted on many an editor this week).</p><p>Dresses played a big role here. A trio in midnight, spruce, and nude silk—high-necked, long-sleeved, and zippered up the back—echoed the streamlined silhouettes of race car-driver uniforms. Others, heavily worked in chevron-quilted wool satin, evoked latter-day suits of armor. Still more came in gorgeous shades of silk velvet dévoré with asymmetrical wrapped bodices. The best of the lot, though, was a violet embroidered silk dress that played nubby texture against see-through mesh. Unlike last season's show, which borrowed heavily from the arsenal of the eighties power babe, this collection referenced nothing so much as McCollough and Hernandez's own growing oeuvre. It proved that the duo don't lack for a strong vision. Boiled down to its essence? They understand what hip downtown girls want to wear.</p></div>"
200,fall,2009,f2009,rachel-comey,"Rachel Comey wants comfort—sure to be a common craving in the current market—so for Fall, when it came to her signature whimsical prints, she looked to the familiar. There were classic cabbage roses, delicate buds, and an oversize leopard pattern…but because this is Rachel Comey, there were also swinging monkeys and little men running with umbrellas.</p><p>Comfort was certainly in abundance in the (sometimes too heavily) layered looks. But the double cardigans that were actually one piece—""twofers,"" the designer called them—were quite sweet over printed silk dresses. Few women want to look as boxy as some of the models did in their cropped jackets, long tops, and longer skirts, but pick apart these looks into their individual elements and there was plenty here to charm.</p></div>"
201,fall,2009,f2009,rachel-roy,"""Bottom line, I wanted it to be strong,"" said Rachel Roy of her new collection, the second one she's shown in the striking lobby of Barry Diller's IAC building. So, out went the bubble skirts, the poufs, and the embellishments that have weighed down some of her previous efforts. And in came a slouchy-but-sharp double-breasted gray flannel suit, a peplum bustier top worn with cigarette pants, and a marble-print long column dress. The flourishes came in the form of chunky mirrored necklaces and cuffs by Subversive Jewelry's Justin Giunta. Roy arranged her presentation by color palette, showing similar silhouettes—a narrow, one-sleeved sheath; a dress with geometric cutouts at the ribs—in blush, pale yellow, slate blue, or black. It made for a big visual impact that was somewhat compromised by the models' bobbed wigs and black lipstick, a too obvious reference to YSL's Fall 2008 show. That distraction aside, Roy's line has done some growing up.</p></div>"
202,fall,2009,f2009,rag-bone,"A trip to Japan got Marcus Wainwright and David Neville's creative juices flowing. ""I've always wanted a samurai sword,"" enthused Wainwright backstage, ""and I've always loved <em>Star Wars</em>."" If not downright dangerous, that's dicey territory to say the least, but their models didn't look like refugees from some George Lucas flick. In shiny crash-proof basket-weave dresses, Loro Piana waterproof wool coats, second-skin ninja trousers, and the occasional chain-mail slip, they were latter-day urban warriors.</p><p>A suitable image for the economic end-times upon us, yes—and one that gave the designers plenty of opportunity to flex their tailoring chops; to give one example, model Freja Beha Erichsen in a boxy cheviot jacket, waistcoat, and tux shirt over slouchy ""haraki"" pants (Rag &amp; Bone's answer to the omnipresent dropped-crotch look).</p><p>The message wasn't entirely postapocalyptic, however. A black wool herringbone tuxedo dress had sex appeal to spare; likewise its more casual cousin, a blue chambray tuxedo shirtdress topped by a narrow gray vest. On the softer, more girlish side, there was a printed silk dress accessorized with an obilike indigo and leather quilted belt, and a skirt in the same fabric topped by a cocoon-y navy kimono cardigan. After last season's dip into England's eighties-pop subcultures, this collection felt a whole lot more modern and vital.</p></div>"
203,fall,2009,f2009,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren supplied a hopeful, positive coda for fashion week. His response to dark times was to let the light in, quite literally. Yes, he opened with a little black dress, but he soon moved into taupe-y tweed suiting, soft pastel knits, and rich velvet dresses, finishing up with antique ivories and golds. Along the way he showcased his great-looking outerwear and subtly glamorous evening options, while touching on such treasured motifs as haberdashery, the equestrian world, and a spot of Anglophilia in the form of Fair Isle knits.</p><p>With even the very rich hunkering down, Lauren made a point of showing plenty of cozy coats. A herringbone tweed topped an embroidered lamé dress, and there were also embroidered shearlings, Mongolian lamb chubbies, and an Oliver Twist-ish patchwork or two that should please the ironists among his fans. For the evening looks that closed the show, he stowed the outerwear, sending out one shimmery dress after another in ivory satin, pale pink charmeuse, or vintage gold lamé. The highlight of the bunch was a delicate frock with a silvery bodice and gauzy pink skirts to the knee, but they all fairly glowed. For 15 minutes, at least, Lauren had you believing that everything is going to be just fine.</p></div>"
204,fall,2009,f2009,ralph-rucci,"Ralph Rucci is a kind of rock star among the chauffeur-driven set (they don't borrow, but actually buy and wear his clothes), and he also has a following among the high-culture crowd (he received an award from the National Design Museum last year). But his name doesn't register with the cool kids, and you probably won't see his work on the Oscars red carpet.</p><p>Today's show won't alter that profile. Though handbags, by Leonello Borghi, were a new addition for the designer, there weren't any surprises in a Fall collection that came in a somewhat drab palette of brown, ivory, and black. Of course, Rucci's celebrated craftsmanship was as much in evidence as ever. There were amazing hand-braided pieces and suits with insets, some of which had a Cubist feel. Katia Kokoreva looked too haute for words in a feathered cage over a caviar-beaded jumpsuit, and an infanta gown with scribbled topstitching took the season's Frankenstein trend to its most elegant conclusion. Day options included smart dresses with pintuck detailing. ""The first word that comes to mind [about Chado],"" said Washington style icon and front-row guest Deeda Blair, ""is quality."" There was certainly enough of that on display today to keep the Rucci loyalists happy.</p></div>"
205,fall,2009,f2009,rebecca-taylor,"Who knew Rebecca Taylor had a flair for knitwear? Her Fall runway wasn't without the usual signatures: Bright florals, a muted leopard print, and an excess of ruffles were laced through the collection. But a cozy Fair Isle cardigan and shimmery cobweb-woven tunic were surprisingly fresh. ""This season, the designs all came about organically,"" the designer said backstage. ""It's just about what women want to wear right now."" We're pleased to note that, chez Taylor, that doesn't just mean familiar silhouettes but some unexpected fare, too.</p></div>"
206,fall,2009,f2009,reem-acra,"""If it were up to me, I'd be doing laundry in one of these gowns,"" said actress Sophia Bush, who came directly from LaGuardia Airport to Reem Acra's presentation this morning. Acra is not a new entry to the fashion calendar, but the bridal-turned-eveningwear specialist's career seems to be at a tipping point. The designer, who is leaving for Los Angeles with her new collection tomorrow, has racked up at least five red-carpet credits between the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards this year.</p><p>For Fall, Acra moved away from froufrou and, partly inspired by the economy, kept things simple. The first look was a jersey turtleneck and fluid crepe skirt; Du Juan wore a subtly shimmering indigo bias-cut column that skimmed her figure like smoke. The showstoppers were four ""couture"" goddess gowns draped by Acra herself. Zuzanna Krzatala's golden iridescent chiffon number, made of 20 yards of fabric but just one seam, looked like a real Oscar contender.</p><p>How is Acra enjoying her moment in the sun? ""I'm excited,"" she said. ""It feels like I finally reached my goal through perseverance, hard work, and focus.""</p></div>"
207,fall,2009,f2009,requiem,"Raffaele Borriello and Julien Desselle showed in the same grand venue as before, the Cercle de l'Union Interalliée, but instead of a live show they arrayed glossy black shop mannequins on their runway and even posed a few in the front row. This money-saving venture gave the duo the opportunity to walk editors and buyers up-close-and-personal through the looks and, while they were doing so, explain how they were rethinking things. Happily, they have dialed down some of the more outré proportions that had burdened previous collections, while still retaining the couture feel they like to call their hallmark.</p><p>Working with intarsias, they spliced together stretch and non-stretch fabrics to create a body-conscious eighties mood in keeping with the prevailing trends. Highlights of the small line included their update of Le Smoking, a cropped black jacket with blue-edged pointy hems and shoulders à la Mugler; and blouse that mixed blush, lavender, teal, and gray silk, which was teamed with a high-waisted olive skirt; and a lone gown, fitted to the thigh then billowing to the floor below, that had real red-carpet potential.</p></div>"
208,fall,2009,f2009,richard-chai-love,"The broad-shouldered power babe has been stomping around a lot of runways this week, but Richard Chai has been honing his tough-luxe vision of this Mighty Aphrodite for a year now. Safe? No. Smart? Yes. ""You can't be safe,"" he said a few days before the show. ""It's not about dumbing things down.""</p><p>For Fall he built on the strongest elements of his past two collections while still pushing forward. From last Fall, he carried over the idea of the slouchy-slim pleated pant worn with artful, cozy layers. For the first time, he added fur to the mix in doses both small (the fox trim on the collar of a silk parka) and large (a lovely long vest of silver fox that punched up a moody-broody navy jacket and mohair sweater). He took his slim-legged silhouette one step slouchier, diving into the wide-leg trouser that's surely just around everyone's fashion corner.</p><p>From Spring, he kept that vibrant ""streaming plaid"" print, seen to full effect in a madly matchy-matchy look of a printed skinny suit coordinated from shirt to wedge shoe. Of course, a breezy silk dress in a romantic ankle length is more likely how this plaid will translate to the retail rack; dresses continue to be an integral part of Chai's business. The other prints, abstracted images of confetti and fireworks, were meant as celebratory sartorial talismans against the prevailing gloom and doom. On little draped and tucked dresses they looked great—reason enough, we think, to break out the bubbly.</p></div>"
209,fall,2009,f2009,richard-nicoll,"With every season, Richard Nicoll's work has been steadily becoming more solidly convincing and wearable—while also getting more inventive each time. It takes some daring, for instance, to make a winter collection more or less entirely in cream and shell pink, and even more to carry it off into the kind of structured clothes, like trenchcoats and streamlined dresses, he's never really made before. But the coats, with their exaggerated storm flaps, and the slick overlays of PVC and sly references to corsetry, looked so chic they could shine on any runway of New York or Paris. And as for the color combinations, well, isn't the world already pleading for some alternative to black and gray?</p><p>Nicoll's way is an unusual combination of pragmatism and a creative flair for making the best of things. The way he patchworked menswear fabric on top of basic toile canvas later in the collection was, he said, ""kind of utilitarian. We've all got to be cost-conscious, and that was my way of superimposing something luxurious on top of something basic."" The other, more slyly subversive element in the show was the injection of corsetry references, from the odd garter belt fastening dangling from a storm flap to a built-in girdle in a powder pink bodysuit. Certainly, there won't be many of those hanging in department stores next fall—but it's perfectly within the bounds of probability that they'll be in hot demand from music industry stylists. Which means, when it comes to the accounting, there's little in this tight collection that won't pay its way.</p></div>"
210,fall,2009,f2009,rick-owens,"""It started off dark,"" mused Rick Owens, as he laconically considered the lightness that overtook him while designing Fall. ""But then…they blossomed into swans."" Of course, it was as otherworldly a flock as ever, but the strange beauty of Owens' collection came across in a triumphal way that has rarely read so well on his runway. Often the intricately evolved layerings that go into his work are hidden by being sunk in black. This time, after eight solid monochrome looks, all that suddenly changed. With a shift into icy blue, pearly gray, palest beige, and silver—from his mink-and-goat fur beanies down to the baggy wedge boots—all the genius of Owens' vision came to light.</p><p>Every look was constructed around a high-necked, raised-shoulder jacket, wrapped at the throat and falling away into various asymmetries beneath. Under that came two or three more layers of tunics or skirts (it was impossible to tell which) over leggings, and boots constructed from soft leather like some sort of Boccioni futurist sculpture. Sounds weird? Not at all to initiates of the beauty of Owens' leather jackets, and the utilitarian cool of practically every component he works in. In reality, what wearers know by heart is that the scary-chic of a Rick Owens runway look actually dismantles to fit an extraordinarily broad spectrum of shapes, lives, and ages. It's made him a huge influence on young girls and a resource for grown sophisticates alike: an American design hero whose time has come.</p></div>"
211,fall,2009,f2009,roberto-cavalli,"It's _arrivederci_for Roberto Cavalli's traditional glamour puss. And so long, as well, to the more romantic muse of recent seasons. His new girl? ""She's tough, aggressive, sexy, and young, and she's going to help me fight this crisis,"" Cavalli said backstage. Her weapons of choice: grommeted and studded black-suede tank dresses and scarves, fur jackets, steel-heeled leather boots so high they disappear underneath her hems, body-conscious knits, and leggings that lace up the sides. Off duty, she might choose jersey T-shirts and minis featuring faded trompe l'oeil prints of dresses from past collections. But after dark, she pulls out the big guns: sheer knit gowns in midnight blue or black, layered over bodysuits that leave miles of leg exposed.</p><p>Sound familiar? No, Cavalli's not on the leading edge of the rocker-chick trend. It's not necessarily fair to call him a follower, though. <em>US Weekly</em> readers and Beyoncé fans might not have picked up on it, but he's been inching away from animal prints and the like for a couple of years. A photographer in the crowd remarked that when he asks one particularly tough, aggressive, sexy, and young editor what she's wearing, the answer is often, ""Cavalli!"" After last season's confused meandering between fifties debutante dresses and seventies disco, this collection not only has the courage of its convictions but also seems destined to sell.</p></div>"
212,fall,2009,f2009,rochas,"Now is not the most opportune moment to resurrect a fashion company, for obvious reasons, but Marco Zanini is giving it a go at Rochas. Supporting him in that endeavor is the Italian manufacturer Gibo, which is now producing the line with plans to keep prices below traditional designer levels. Inspired in equal measure by the French couture house's long history and nouvelle vague films—specifically the Jean-Luc Godard heroine Anna Karina—Zanini produced a collection, built upon the foundation of the silk slip, that stood quite apart from the season's prevailing eighties mood. The clothes were presented installation-style at an art gallery in the Marais, which allowed for up-close examination of the handmade details and witty touches that the designer hopes will become a brand hallmark.</p><p>As you entered, you were greeted by gauzy tulle dresses backlit to expose their beading, pintucking, and sequins, all of which were done by hand. Inside, a drop-waist number, a navy skirtsuit, a hand-knit heavy gauge silk dress, and other looks were positioned on mannequins around a mirrored centerpiece that allowed for glimpses of the surprises in back: a transparent chiffon illusion neckline, a pair of zippers behind the hips to create a smooth waistline. Other touches—the crochet silk lace at the hem of pleated skirt linings, ribbons inset into the linings of menswear blazers, intarsia Rochas logos on the inside of cashmere cardigan pockets—are details intended for only the wearer to enjoy.</p><p>It was interesting how different a look this was from the one Olivier Theyskens created for Rochas. While still delicate, Zanini's version is much more pared down—intriguingly, the restraint of the work recalls what he briefly did at Halston two seasons ago. ""This is simplicity in French,"" he said. It's an approach that has created a collection of pieces that feel quite right for this time. All in all, a promising start.</p></div>"
213,fall,2009,f2009,rodarte,"""They are unique,"" said Kirsten Dunst of Kate and Laura Mulleavy, front-row at their show today. ""They didn't just study fashion. You can see that. It's very emotional clothing.""</p><p>Certainly the intuitive Pasadena-based sister act continues to bring a frisson of excitement to New York fashion week. Their clothes generate strong reactions—positive, more often than not. Backstage, editors were effusive in praise of the collection's mix of Balenciaga-like futurism and off-kilter romance. The Mulleavys wisely moved away from the Japanese and robotic references this season and toward something more organic: metal, wood, and stone. ""We were interested in the building and taking apart of homes,"" Laura explained. ""And then an image of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein magically popped into our minds."" Thus anime made way for…yes, monsters.</p><p>The Mulleavys' main conceit was marbling. Pale leathers and silk chiffons were printed or silk-screened to resemble veined gray stone, then cut up Edward Scissorhands-style, collaged onto skirts and minidresses—like Frankenstein's skin was pieced together—and worn with fierce hip boots by Nicholas Kirkwood. ""Like straitjackets"" is how Laura described some of the bondage-y leathers. When it came to knits, the sisters swept away the cobwebs to make room for denser, shaggy cardigans and thick cowls.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""y22fio""></div></div><p>If the unvarying silhouette (high hem, high boots) was a bit relentless, each number was worked in such an individual way that it looked handmade. What the show lacked in breadth, it made up for in singularity.</p></div>"
214,fall,2009,f2009,roksanda,"Roksanda Ilincic has pulled herself together. The collection she showed in the classy establishment surroundings of the Gladstone Library (a stone's throw from Downing Street) was a fulfillment of the promise of this Serbian-born designer's innate personal chic. It's a style that evolved out of her adoration of seventies and eighties Yves Saint Laurent (which her mother wore), via the crucible of Central Saint Martins' M.A. program, where she learned how to make drama out of exaggerated shapes.</p><p>Until now, the trouble was that it was all getting a bit lost in yards of loopy, semifitted, frayed-edge material. But it seems the bracing reality of this year's economic chill made her shape up, finish seams, sculpt shoulders, and clarify the fact that she can offer separates like beautiful, draped silk velvet tops, and not just party dresses. It hasn't been at the cost of her essential character, though. Ilincic has been working massive shoulder volumes for at least three seasons, and now they fall within the realm of the acceptable. She's also deft with fabric and color, choosing crocodile-stamped gunmetal brocade, violet duchesse satin, and silvery panne velvet this season. Ilincic is moving toward a mastery of the formal skills that will showcase her flair better than ever.</p></div>"
215,fall,2009,f2009,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret might be fixed in many people's minds as the designer of supereffective figure-hugging cocktail dresses, but he's canny enough to foresee he'll need another string to his bow now that future Champagne expenditure is likely to be just slightly more on the meager side. With this collection, he trained his thoughts far more on day clothes calibrated for women whose primary focus is keeping employed, rather than pleasing (or snaring) a man.</p><p>Thankfully, this was hardly ""careerwear."" Mouret had gone away and developed knitwear for the first time, factoring in his observation of how the young professional women around him really dress. Sleek legs, tops, and jackets were his answer—and that lithe silhouette came across, with the luxury amplified, in gilded dégradé crocodile-embossed jersey dresses and skinny leggings. Mouret also had plenty of short, zippered jackets and pleat-front, narrow-ankle pants, covering ""separates"" before getting too deeply into evening. He'd concentrated especially on developing what he calls the ""TTD,"" a drapey multitasking wardrobe tool that can be used as a tunic, top, or dress. It appeared layered under short jackets and over pants.</p><p>The low-frequency erotic charge distinctive of Mouret's look was fully present, though. The touches on his signature dresses—like the back zippers and the inside-out seaming (where the surplus seam allowance forms external, wavy demi-frill, which shivers when the wearer walks)—were now displaced provocatively to the left of the spine, so that the eye was forced downward to mull over where these ended, at the top of one buttock. He included evening dresses—one in bottle green with long sleeves and a thigh slit looked new for Mouret—but the overall impression was that this was a carefully muted outing, using plenty of almost no-color shades. If at times the pace smacked too much of the ""selling collection,"" there was more than enough here to reinforce Mouret's reputation as someone who works hard to find creative functional fashion solutions that speak to needs rather than mere froth.</p></div>"
216,fall,2009,f2009,rue-du-mail,"Before Martine Sitbon's models took to the catwalk, there was a huge Champagne spill as a waiter lost control of a flute-filled tray. It seemed entirely appropriate, given that the Sitbon girl has for decades proved herself perfectly capable of stumbling with carefree elegance from wild gig to wilder after-show. Eyes messily rimmed in glitter, she stalked this particular runway in a crazy collage of rock-chick cliché: One outfit alone combined a hoodie, schoolgirl pleats, sequins, and a body-limning techno fabric.</p><p>Such random contrasts were actually something of an intentional signature in the collection. A gray flannel dress with knit sleeves suggesting the Middle Ages, a strapless number over a fine mohair top, a midnight leather dress with semi-Napoleonic frogging—all evinced Sitbon's combination of acute tailoring and eye for odd detail (less so the silver short shorts and the black velvet corset belt, which muttered Led Zeppelin arm candy circa '72). The leitmotif of the collection was the hood, worn as a crepe cowl or unzipped and capelike. Matched with Sitbon's leggings, it created a strong, seductive silhouette that made you wish the average rock chick had this much taste.</p></div>"
217,fall,2009,f2009,ruffian,"For the last couple of seasons, Brian Wolk and Claude Morais of Ruffian have been exploring youth cultures—New England boarding school preppies one season, Woodstock love children the next—and not always with great success. (Spring's ramble into haute hippiedom felt particularly forced.) Ladylike is just more their speed, so they smartly put polished tailoring and nighttime frills back on the agenda for Fall. A fitted peplum jacket cut to show off just a hint of shoulder and worn with a smocked tube skirt in matching gray cashmere-cotton stood out, but the ladies will have their pick of skirtsuits, too, in boiled ivory bouclé or handwoven oversize black and gold houndstooth. If they prefer a dress, there's the navy and white chalk stripe, cut to fit like a glove. Pants were high-waisted, full, and cropped a few inches above the ankle.</p><p>A beaded jaguar dress on a peachy-pink background was a novel way to do an animal print. But for evening the designers favored reprising their familiar hits. A black silk-cotton dress came with grand, notice-me ruffles at the armholes, while a narrow red number blossomed above the waist like a rose. The models' black point d'esprit body stockings notwithstanding, this was the Ruffian boys at their most sophisticated.</p></div>"
218,fall,2009,f2009,saint-laurent,"""I have to reflect the times, and this really is my mood,"" said Stefano Pilati. The impact of the resized economy, which has scattered much of Paris fashion week to grungy suburban venues and induced nervy, vacillating results on many runways, only produced a positive response in this house. Shown in close-up on a narrow walkway around an upper gallery in the centrally located Palais de Tokyo, the presentation—like the clothes themselves—was fully concentrated on demonstrating a confident vision of modern city wardrobing. It was monochrome, but far from down, with a particular Pilati-esque superchic Frenchness filtered through the YSL codes of black leather, gray flannel, pristine white shirting, and, of course, Le Smoking.</p><p>Pilati had taken the idea of the motorcycle jacket (a Saint Laurent landmark piece from his early collection for Christian Dior) to kick-start his design process. The show opened with black leather, some of it textured with thermo-molding technology borrowed from the car industry. There was a touch of eroticism (a zippered bodysuit would have thrilled Helmut Newton), but the material was mainly used to construct sleek, though not too close-fitting, pieces for everyday street wear. From there, Pilati worked into the flannel and chalk stripes, developing the most elegantly desirable pants (no more Japanese drop-crotch extremes) and cutting jackets with an unpadded extended shoulder.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>There was no falling back on the all-too-easy clichés of the eighties that have beset many other collections. That was down to the effort Pilati put into honing the tailoring into new but accessible shapes. A mannish blazer—big in the shoulder, narrow in the hips—was conceived for adaptability; the designer imagined how it could be worn over a skirt, dress, leggings, or on its own over opaque tights (and no ordinary tights—close-up, some of them had a <em>changeant</em> green-black sheen; others had fishnet fused into the surface). Within this new clarity of thinking, Pilati turned out coats with curviform hems, paneled skirts with a coolly sexy flip in the hem, and crisp white blouses with complex volumes in the sleeve. It was ""ordinary,"" practical dressing, in a way, but done with all the savoir faire of a Parisian powerhouse.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6nzhr3""></div></div><p>Pilati's concise message left no room for grandiose evening gestures, though there were a couple of short, simple, and desirable velvet dresses, with a subtle sparkle applied through metallic flocking. He had also thought about day-to-night usefulness, weaving a low-shine lamé thread into multitasking charcoal dresses and jumpsuits that could be worn to work or out to dinner. The show concluded not with miles of red-carpet chiffon destined for one-night-only appearances but with a black tuxedo coat-dress, loosely buttoned over: the sort of piece Pilati foresees a woman keeping in her wardrobe forever. ""Of course we have evening dresses, always, at Saint Laurent,"" he said. ""But I think timelessness is a good message for now, no?""</p></div>"
219,fall,2009,f2009,shipley-halmos,"With a succession of models clad in matching black turtlenecks meticulously zigzagging along route markers that had been painted on the floor, it was apparent that this show was more about concepts than directional fashion. ""These pieces are for an individualist,"" Sam Shipley insisted before the show, ""someone with conviction and an end goal in mind."" But while individualism may have been the intention, what we got was a repetitive parade of little dresses cut in leather and lightweight silks, offering not much in the way of innovation. Shipley and his design partner, Jeff Halmos, have an enviably fashion-forward following; they'd be wise to push the envelope a little further next time.</p></div>"
220,fall,2009,f2009,sinha-stanic,"Perhaps the economic maelstrom is producing at least one helpful side effect for designers. After years when many have found themselves making runway statements for the sake of it, or driven to keep up with what other people do for no good reason, they're now being forced to make a hard assessment of who they are and what they do best.</p><p>That's the case with Sinha-Stanic's Aleksandar Stanic and Fiona Sinha, who decided to concentrate on 19 draped dresses and one pantsuit for Fall, end of story. ""Actually, it's been enjoyable. Now that we've stopped dealing with the big-show scenario, we've gone back to what people liked about our clothes in the first place,"" said Stanic. ""Downsizing means I'm draping dresses on Fiona's body again, like we used to.""</p><p>It's those expertly placed tucks and folds, strategically positioned to ""minimize the hip and flatter where it matters—and make it modern,"" said Sinha, that women always respond to. So this season they've utilized a screen-grab print from the backdrop of their last show, colored it in tints of violet and purple, added marabou feather edgings, and worked on Pearly King and Queen button patterns and photo prints. The result: a compact little collection that distills the best of their talent, and which Stanic insists might just as well be worn by day as evening. ""All you need is to throw on a biker jacket,"" he claims, pointing to the cropped shearling cycle jackets that are their one concession to outerwear.</p></div>"
221,fall,2009,f2009,sonia-rykiel,"It was going to be hard to top last season's 40th anniversary extravaganza, but Sonia Rykiel and her daughter, Nathalie, came up with something that—although it was much smaller in scale—brought just as many smiles to the assembled faces. The concept: Get the models to talk to the crowd as they took their turns around the designer's Boulevard Saint-Germain boutique. Out one came, spouting, ""<em>Je m'appelle</em> Imogen, and I'm wearing a knit dress."" And another, in a black fur coat: ""I'm a black fox, I'm a foxy girl."" And this, from a third: ""I'm wearing sunglasses because I'm a star."" Their voices, some American English, but mostly Russian-accented French, overlapped as they twirled around the two-floor space—and it was so utterly charming (who knew these ice princesses could be so animated?) you almost forgot to notice the clothes.</p><p>Those were adorable, too. There was a fair bit of the garçon to this collection, be it in a black velvet smoking or a plaid waistcoat worn with pleat-front trousers. But for the most part it was as girly as ever: There were ruffles galore, as on a double-breasted velvet coat or streaming down the front of a light purple dress; Lurex-shot sweater dresses almost as sparkly as sequined tank dresses in the same black, blue, and bronze palette; and color-blocked knits. Perched in the middle of the front row, Madame Rykiel seemed quietly pleased that she still has the power to delight.</p></div>"
222,fall,2009,f2009,sophia-kokosalaki,"This turned out to be a strong season for Sophia Kokosalaki: It's been ten years since the Greek-born designer emerged in London, and it so happens her particular métiers of drape, leather, and rock-inspired imagery are now slap-bang center stage as live fashion concerns. ""The first materials I could use when I started were leather, jersey, and tulle, because they were the only things that were easy to find,"" she remembers. Practice makes perfect: The collection she sent out was a natural-born, authentic take on cool, bejeweled rocker jackets and non-chichi draped dresses—a clear statement from one of the only young female voices to have a credible say on the subject this Fall.</p><p>Kokosalaki's leather and tarnished-metal embroidered jackets were outstanding, with cropped shapes that emphasized shoulders. Much effort went into taking the edge off on the glam-bling front, avoiding a trashy pitfall that has scuppered others this season. Instead, her chain-mail bolero and a cognac leather biker neatly sidestepped vulgarity while raising the pulses of onlookers who like to source a special piece from someone who (for all her experience) still counts as a discovery. Other pieces—Kokosalaki's asymmetrically nipped and draped nude jersey dress, and her whipped-around black tulle veiling over lingerie slips—were similarly right in line with what grander names have been up to this Fall, and arguably just as well done. After a decade in business, things are going her way. At the end, she laughed with a rhetorical Greek shrug: ""Is it time for me to stop being a 'young designer' yet?""</p></div>"
223,fall,2009,f2009,sophie-theallet,"""Sophie's magic is that she knows how to make clothes. Most people are stylists,"" Rupert Everett opined as the audience, which included Veronica Webb and Kanye West, was gathering before the lights went down.</p><p>While other designers were getting naughty and nineties, Théallet—ever one to dance to her own drummer—was going native. ""I was inspired by the grace and strength of Native American tribes and how they approach difficult situations with grace and love,"" she said in an interview before the show. Fascinated with indigenous peoples since she was a child, the Brooklyn-based designer recently spent time on a Canadian reserve as well as in Manhattan's American Museum of Natural History, where she studied traditional garments and ""took some elements that really touched me and spoke to my heart.""</p><p>Dresses, in silhouettes similar to those from Spring, were finished with pleats, tiers, and pintucks that rounded the neck like a chieftain's bone necklace, and appliqués in totemic shapes. She visualized the ""strong and happy"" colors of her bold palette ""fighting each other like warriors."" A tobacco-brown coat was smartly autumnal, and the show-closing teepee-shaped tiered skirt was glorious. Like all the looks, it was accessorized with moccasin boots created in conjunction with Sorel.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""jli50k""></div></div><p>Théallet was reared in France, mind you, and the Frenchness of these Native American looks shone through in the finesse with which she applied her craft. As the final model stepped softly and regally down the runway, out from the loudspeakers came the lyrics ""<em>Tout va bien.</em>""</p></div>"
224,fall,2009,f2009,strk,"After Camilla Stærk saw Patti Smith live a few months ago, it led her back to Smith's famed Mapplethorpe portrait, and in short order, Stærk was waist-deep in the photographer's work. ""I've always loved his pictures,"" said the designer at her joint presentation with her friend, menswear designer Victor Glemaud. ""They're so strong but still so sensitive."" That's a pretty apt description of Stærk's 14 Fall looks, which merged the tough edges of black leather, mesh tank tops, and a general sense of naughtiness with lace, tweed, and ladylike polish. A black, sleek leather-look jersey shell was inset with lace. A properly soigné high-waisted pencil skirt was paired with a sheer corset. Even the lovely aluminum floral brooches (from Japanese designer Shinji Nakaba) that were pinned on both lean gowns and motorcycle jackets played the strong-yet-sensitive card. Every season has seen Stærk deepening her moody, dark signatures, but the new elegance here is a delightful evolution.</p></div>"
225,fall,2009,f2009,stella-mccartney,"Say goodbye to the all-in-one. For Fall, Stella McCartney put aside the sportier sensibility that's become her MO of late and embraced the twin passions with which she launched her label back in the late nineties: suiting and slipdresses. ""I wanted to look at what makes a Stella girl,"" she said. The result was one of the designer's best collections in some time.</p><p>Jackets in black and white or red and black micro-checks were roomy and long enough to function as a dress, which they were asked to do when paired on the runway with vegan legging boots. (These needle-heeled numbers were definitely up there with the season's other extreme footwear.) Elegant cocoon coats were made edgier with super-skinny belts, and a couple of them got the trompe l'oeil treatment—coming, they looked like a jacket and skirt. Houndstooth, meanwhile, appeared on clingy knit sweater dresses.</p><p>The prettiest slipdresses we've seen from New York to Paris put into practice something else McCartney mentioned backstage: her interest in taking things apart and putting them together again. Silk was spliced with tulle to create provocative peekaboo panels raying out from the midriff and down the legs. The same trick was used on illusion sleeves so it looked like black lace was floating on the models' arms. For an evening alternative, there was also a black bugle-beaded suit.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""c5qra""></div></div><p>McCartney's real-world approach means she can attract gals as different as Beth Ditto, Thandie Newton, Salma Hayek, and Nan Goldin, all of whom were there in her front row. Pushing boundaries wasn't the point of this collection, but she did provide a complete wardrobe for women who connect with her brand of easy, unfussy sex appeal.</p></div>"
226,fall,2009,f2009,stephen-burrows,"There were pinstripes aplenty in Stephen Burrows' Fall collection, titled ""Bankable Burrows."" ""This is a time about money,"" the designer explained after the show. ""I want to make beautiful clothes at an affordable price that look good inside and out."" A bicolored, double-faced wool cape coat certainly looked like a solid investment piece, as did a sweeping camel topper that concealed a microscopic silver-beaded nude jersey dress. Also upping the sex quotient were leopard boots by Christian Louboutin and jewelry by Robert Lee Morris. ""Burrows' main appeal will always be that he likes the female form,"" said his model friend Alva Chinn, seated front-row. ""There's always comfort and ease."" Those qualities should be important to the boutique buyers who are Burrows' main accounts, and whose support will be more crucial than ever in this environment.</p></div>"
227,fall,2009,f2009,tao,"It's never easy parsing the origins of Tao Kurihara's collections. This season, one front-row type guessed Scandinavia or Russia. Another suggested Turkey or maybe Mexico. Backstage, the Rei Kawakubo disciple first cited cake decorations, but then revealed it was Eastern Europe that captured her interest. The former explains the frothy silhouettes of her baby-doll dresses, quilted jackets, and dirndl skirts, as well as the ribbonlike prints and embroideries. The latter gave the collection its red, black, and white color palette, the folkloric striped flower prints, and the black velvet bows, as well as the smocking on her pantaloons.</p><p>This was undoubtedly one of Kurihara's more whimsical efforts—an impression underscored by the Frida Kahlo swipes of red face paint across the models' brows, the cloudlike hats, and the white patent-leather oxfords with clownlike proportions. But there were pieces that have serious crossover potential—the little red and black sweaters smothered with bows, for starters, or the sack dresses in crushed velvet and striped florals that were worn over white poplin button-down shirts. Still, Kurihara is nothing if not a dreamer. You'd hope there was still room for some of that spirit in this strange new world.</p></div>"
228,fall,2009,f2009,temperley-london,"After showing her collection in London last season, Alice Temperley is back on the New York schedule—though not in the conventional sense. She's opted out of a runway show in favor of a two-day presentation at her Soho loft space and a simultaneous online video launch, which Style.com previewed exclusively in advance of its debut. ""I've been looking for an alternative way to show for a while now, and with editors and retailers cutting back on travel, the video seemed like a good, maybe even greener, way to reach a wider audience,"" Temperley explained.</p><p>The Silk Route was her starting point for Fall, and it led her in more than a few different directions: From Japan (not technically part of the Silk Route, but work with us), origami detailing accented the lapels of jackets and the waistbands of skirts, while the rose print of relaxed day dresses and a grand cocoon coat evoked kimono silks. Moving on, there were tunics with jeweled necklines, high-waisted genie pants, and intarsia sweater dresses trimmed in colorful pompoms, as well as towering ponyskin fezzes. If that verged on overload, sharp military tailoring, gold-studded leather jackets and coats, and figure-forming stretch dresses won points for adding a sexier edge to this designer's formula. That continued into evening via gold military cording on crepe de chine. All in all, this was a leaner, meaner Temperley—the presentation/video combo wasn't the only way she broke her fashion week mold this season.</p><p><strong>see the video &gt;</strong> &gt;</p></div>"
229,fall,2009,f2009,thakoon,"""Tilda made my year,"" Thakoon Panichgul said in a preshow interview, referring to the fact that the actress wore his gown to the Berlin film festival. The journalist-turned-designer has been on a roll since dressing Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention last August, so the heat was on as he presented his Fall collection to an audience that included White House social secretary Desirée Rogers and longtime supporter Amanda Peet. The upshot? Surprisingly safe, retail-friendly clothes that combined elements of the designer's past work.</p><p>Panichgul, who likes a touch of the surreal, explored that theme not only in print for Fall, but with texture as well, showing a cascading gown made of a ruffle-patterned matelessé fabric. A winter-white double-faced wool dress with the outlines of a bomber jacket etched into it referenced the designer's interest in construction. And, as always, there were fun feminine touches—cue the built-in bows. Culottes will always be a hard sell, but Panichgul's suits were more convincing. If the end result felt somewhat blurred, perhaps that's the inevitable—and hopefully only temporary—result of being thrust into the spotlight's glare.</p></div>"
230,fall,2009,f2009,threeasfour,"At Threeasfour's presentation-cum-performance piece at Greene Naftali Gallery, models pruned bonsai trees perched on oblique pedestals to the atmospheric sounds of the Icelandic singer Kría Brekkan. The scene came to Adi Gil, one-third of the design triumvirate, in a dream. It was off the wall to be sure, but the scene wasn't a total disconnect from the clothes. Instead of their familiar curvilinear constructions, Threeasfour worked with the geometric shapes of crystals. Straight cuts replaced circular ones, and sheer silks were matched with opaque wools. Completing the metaphor, some of the looks were accented with Swarovski crystals neatly arrayed in squares or triangles. ""We wanted to do something different,"" said Gil. ""Something that felt honest to this time."" The minimalist palette—half the looks were in black, and the others were in off-white—helped their game plan, as did the sharp, almost futuristic tailoring. Pants were spliced at the knee, and coats were layered together from planes of fabric in a manner that recalled armor. As for the dresses, they were a patchwork of polygons, stitched together at odd angles that created asymmetric necklines and handkerchief hems. It was interesting that the vocabulary changed, but the end results didn't. The collection was still signature Threeasfour—arty, intellectual, and anything but ordinary.</p></div>"
231,fall,2009,f2009,tibi,"While some designers are pushing luxe basics to prudent shoppers this season, Tibi designer Amy Smilovic is taking a different approach. ""I'm pushing the envelope more,"" she said before the show. ""Every print is crazier. I'm designing pieces my girl has to have."" Splashy patterns inspired by the illustrations in Gennady Spirin's Russian fairy tale <em>The Tale of the Firebird</em> adorned frocks of every hem length, which were accessorized, fittingly, with <em>shapkas</em> and pashminalike fur wraps. Smilovic also carried over one of her stronger Spring looks, the sharp-shouldered blouse that is shaping up as a key Fall silhouette. By offering directional clothing at an attainable price point, Tibi should have no problem luring its customer.</p></div>"
232,fall,2009,f2009,todd-lynn,"Todd Lynn called his show ""Di Meliora""—""Heaven send us better times""—and soundtracked it with sonorous cathedral chants. Free-associating, I thought of the deeply religious Cristobal Balenciaga and his obsessive, lifelong quest for the perfect sleeve as the path to transcendence. Lynn has also obsessively refined his aesthetic over the years, but it's pants, not sleeves, he's fixated on. For Fall, they came impossibly lean and long, in leather, wool, and velvet, unbuttoning over vertiginous Louboutins. The designer paired them with equally fitted jackets, their attenuated silhouette underpinned by second-skin leather turtlenecks. The look has a certain appeal, but it's also utterly unforgiving, and that transported the mind (this one, anyway) to a fantasy realm where a rigorously chic but intransigent religious body would be drawn to Lynn's update of the Grand Inquisitor's rig. Accessories—the strands of trailing crystal, the long black satin scarf with cross-shaped crystal insets, the fringes of hair that trimmed the models' ankles—compounded the effect. The final outfits—a white satin cutaway tux over a white leather body, the same in black—played like the angel and devil on Lynn's shoulders. George Michael sang ""You gotta have faith"" as the designer took his bow. Faith in the minimal body mass index of your customer, perhaps?</p></div>"
233,fall,2009,f2009,tommy-hilfiger,"Tommy Hilfiger traded Avery Fisher Hall for Bryant Park this season, but his heart belongs one block further east. He christened his Fall collection ""Quintessentially Fifth Avenue"" in honor of the massive 22,000-square-foot universe-of-Tommy flagship he's slated to open at 681 Fifth come late August. These days, of course, that stretch of town sees all kinds of looks. Hilfiger, however, isn't interested in the reality of what pounds the pavement, but rather the ideal of what should and occasionally does.</p><p>That's not to say that this collection didn't present a realistic vision. Hilfiger now treats the sartorial icons he once fetishized nearly to the point of camp with a far lighter hand. It may not be rocket science, but there's a smart sophistication in a camel peacoat over faded jeans and brown leather boots (the latter blessedly free of a platform). A navy jersey dress with a buttoned-on apron front twisted a familiar motif. And a look of high-waisted silk pants with a draped sweater hinted at a more fashionable sensibility.</p><p>The Fall mantra was ""aspirational, yet attainable,"" and these clothes (many of which will retail for below $400) are very much that—a polished, practical wardrobe for the young career set. Well, mostly, since Hilfiger did catch the neon bug that's been zipping around New York. Electric pink on Fifth? Hmm. Well, downtown is just a Metrocard swipe away.</p></div>"
234,fall,2009,f2009,topshop-unique,"If you're a teenager now, and fall into what is theoretically Topshop's prime demographic, then the eighties and early nineties were either before you were born, or you were too young to remember anything about them. Well, here's the news: That era was the last time anyone in fashion design seems to recall as being about really good, do-it-yourself creative fun, and this season, the Topshop Unique team, like everyone else, is determined to feed it all back to a new generation to cheer things up.</p><p>Jacqui Markham, who designs the range with Karen Bonser at Topshop's HQ off Oxford Street, says that when it came time to compile mood boards, ""we were coming up with images of grunge and sci-fi and New Age travelers, which is why we ended up with this mix of spaceship prints and patterns taken from crop circles. A lot of it, like the hair with ribboned braid, the sweat suits, and the glow sticks, came from rave culture, too. Though we didn't want to be literal about it.""</p><p>The show hit on all the trends that have emerged in the ""senior"" designer collections so far this season: a bit of intergalactic futurism in the shape of metallic leather tunics and bodysuits, mixed up with oversize eighties coat shapes with giant lapels, and some great sequined sweatpants and cowl-hooded sweatshirts. The really smart thing is how each look is so layered in tempting spending opportunities, from the giant knitted comfort-blanket scarves to the squiggle-printed leggings to the glow-in-the-dark Perspex necklaces and handbag hardware right down to the glitter socks. It will all arrive in Topshop's new New York flagship in September, in time to happy things up for young consumers. Who's to say, though, that they won't have started their own movement by then? Creativity always comes out in adversity—which is exactly why the fashion behind the current nostalgia wave happened in the first place. It isn't all doom and gloom, then, after all: Sooner or later, the kids will have their own say.</p></div>"
235,fall,2009,f2009,tory-burch,"""This Fall we're really pushing it. We want to evolve our collection and push our customer,"" Tory Burch said before her military-goes-Pop presentation at the Prince George Ballroom. If stretch-leather leggings done the Tory way read more tomboy than tough, that's as it should be: Burch isn't designing for hard-rock hell-raisers but for blue-blooded businesswomen.</p><p>And the label did take a step forward this season. Even when revisiting old favorites like the mariner shirt, peacoat, and biker boot, the effect was a lot less preppy than in the past. It was easy to see Burch's work appealing to customers outside the Southampton-Fifth Avenue territorial range. Leggings paired with a black sequined top were very Edie Sedgwick, as were fur vests and a light, spangled racerback dress. A petal-strewn winter-white ensemble, very textural, and a tomato-red coat delivered for latter-day Baby Janes. Famous for 15 minutes? Not Burch. This collection of covetable and accessibly priced classics clearly demonstrates her staying power.</p></div>"
236,fall,2009,f2009,tracy-reese,"Tracy Reese worked a schoolgirl vibe for Fall, adding nerdy specs (one of this season's mini trends), knit caps, and kneesocks to most of her looks. Dresses—fun, flirty, and uncomplicated—came in shades of saffron, mauve, and rose, and could be styled just as easily for a campus as for a beach resort during winter break. That adaptability is one of the strengths of Reese's brand; she may not be forging new territory, but her pieces have a wear-anywhere quality and enough thoughtful details to make them appealing.</p></div>"
237,fall,2009,f2009,trovata,"Trovata's John Whitledge dutifully revealed his influences for this season—the sexual and political undertones of Paris, circa 1968—backstage before the show, but as the liner notes put it, ""at the end of the day, fashion, to us, is about having fun and designing clothing that people want to wear."" That sense of free-spiritedness added a light touch to a line that has matured in recent seasons. Airy ruffled blouses, a well-proportioned wool bomber, and a drop-waist cotton dress with peekaboo petticoat all aimed for the playful sophistication inherent to Parisians and often imitated by others. In a crowded contemporary market, Trovata's look should stand out.</p></div>"
238,fall,2009,f2009,tse,"As the label celebrates 20 years, TSE is refocusing its attention on its core business: cashmere. It's about time: The company's revolving roster of designers—from Narciso Rodriguez to Tess Giberson—has tended to generate more column inches than the clothes. Fall's team-designed lineup was almost monastic in its minimalism. This was a collection built upon layering: Detachable pieces like shawls and hoods were wrapped over unitards, bodysuits, and jumpers, resulting in an aesthetic that was at once classical and futuristic. While experiments like skirt pants and aprons threatened to spin out of orbit, TSE can bank on the rib knit leggings and double-faced outerwear.</p></div>"
239,fall,2009,f2009,tuleh,"Bryan Bradley recently reread <em>Them</em>, Francine du Plessix Gray's memoir of her parents—Alexander Liberman (of Condé Nast) and Tatiana du Plessix (the model and society milliner), who fled the Nazis in 1941—and he was struck by how germane to our New World these Russian émigrés' spirit of resourcefulness and adaptability was. The designer, who recently sold a stake in his company, is in the throes of his own burst of self-reinvention: He'll soon debut a diffusion line called Bryan Bradley, he's launching an accessories collection, and there's the new interiors business, too. (The latter explained the rugs used as props at the show, held at the New York Design Center.) Although he dresses uptown girls, Bradley has never been a conformist, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that he is in expansion mode just as others are tightening their belts.</p><p>From the first look, winter-white pants worn with a mannish shirt and jacquard jacket, this was one of the designer's most confident—and dapper—efforts yet. Menswear touches added crispness to a lineup that had all the usual Tuleh charm, minus the hodgepodge quality of some past outings. Unexpected fabrications added interest, too—take the flash of sequins enlivening a mauve-y rose-print dress, or a sleeveless hoodie done in luxe jacquard. One has the sense that Bradley is, at last, feeling at home in his talent.</p></div>"
240,fall,2009,f2009,twenty8twelve,"Sienna and Savannah Miller were talking up a storm about the runway debut of their collection, Twenty8Twelve, which now has two stores in London and sells to many others around the world. Not that they were adamant about declaring any runway theme. ""It started off as a grunge collection in one direction, then as a glam collection in the other,"" said Sienna, ""and then it all met somewhere in the middle."" Or, as Savannah put it, ""Pirates of the road meets Grace Jones,"" adding that from the business point of view, ""we're in a good place to show. It's selling well, and I think it's relevant to be able to show a commercial, contemporary collection in London. It's normal in New York. There should be things girls can really afford."" Her sister—a style leader every British tabloid reader has followed since she reinvented boho—agreed: ""We just want to do what girls want to wear, really,"" she said.</p><p>Even though the Millers' brand has a big corporate backer in the form of the Spanish jeanswear manufacturer that is behind Pepe, the show was very much a first-steps affair. All young designers—even relatively well-off ones—need time to develop, and between the spray-on stretch jeans, the padded-shoulder T-shirts, the slouchy beanies, and the downbeat washed-out color, there wasn't much that isn't already standard young fast-fashion. There's strength, though, in Twenty8Twelve's leather jackets, a staple they can work on as a signature. Savannah noted that none of them retail at more than £500, which is reason enough for young customers to start watching the line. As Topshop has learned, pushing design ever further only increases salability as well as silencing critics who say that such labels have no right to show during a fashion collections week. Now that Twenty8Twelve has an official time slot awarded it by the British Fashion Council, too, the onus is on these two girls to step up to the competition next time.</p></div>"
241,fall,2009,f2009,undercover,"Undercover didn't have a Paris show this season. Instead, Jun Takahashi took two models into a forest outside Tokyo in subzero temperatures and photographed them on a silver ""runway"" consisting of a few Mylar survival blankets ($1.60 apiece) laid end to end. The point—which became clear in a showroom in Paris, where Takahashi talked editors through racks of the clothes—is that the girls weren't cold. The clothes Takahashi designed this time around were a development of the super-technological collection he did for Winter 2007. ""I took a break from showing so I could go back and work on it more,"" he said.</p><p>Close-up, the outerwear, in particular, is an amazingly instructive lesson in the possibilities of modern functional design. Takahashi hybridizes biker jackets, puffers, parkas, regular tailoring, and knits to produce lightweight jackets and coats, which are lined with membranes and microcapsules developed for NASA. Some of them absorb body heat indoors and then release it when the wearer steps out into colder conditions. Others will block biting windchill, even though they're ostensibly as flimsy as blazers.</p><p>What's cool is that the content is invisible to the naked eye. Takahashi's shapes run the gamut from dégradé-shaded down jackets to tuxedo coats with knit sleeves and rabbit cuffs to techno-satin evening parkas photo-printed with jewelry. Top-grade style desirability and high-spec functionality are built into every piece in equal measure. It's extremely rare that any fashion designer is smart enough to take time to devote to research and development—the onward pressure of having to show every six months actively militates against it. But here, Undercover has produced a range that harnesses modern technology in ways that make dressing for winter an effortless pleasure.</p></div>"
242,fall,2009,f2009,united-bamboo,"There was a seat reserved for Kanye West at United Bamboo. Apparently the rapper has blogged about the brand. And even though West was a no-show in the end, there was still plenty of support on hand for Thuy Pham and Miho Aoki. Waris Ahluwalia, Chiara Clemente, Sissel Kardel, the Confetti System trio, Sean Lennon, James Iha (who did the music), and Rita Ackermann (who designed a print used in the collection) were front and center. So was Terence Koh, the art world's reigning It boy—and UB campaign model. How does Koh define the label's appeal? ""United Bamboo's clothes remind me of being a schoolgirl or boy,"" he said. ""They have a sense of innocence.""</p><p>Cue look one: a shapely gray melton wool jumper worn over an organdy blouse. Later on, there were plaid-bodied and white-collared ""cleric"" shirts. The outstanding looks in this collection, though, were the grown-up architectural coats, constructed with hexagonal and triangular pattern pieces—and a lighter hand than in the past. Less convincing were fanciful metallic jacquards that jarred with otherwise sober—and at times seriously chic—tailored pieces. That's not to say there was no fun in the lineup. In keeping with Pham and Aoki's aim to make things ""more dressed up,"" there were two sweet and simple cocktail dresses that should help the wearer create a stir.</p></div>"
243,fall,2009,f2009,valentino,"The fanfare of their first haute couture outing behind them, the new Valentino designers, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli, presented their ready-to-wear collection today, and while the label's retired founder wasn't visibly cheering from the sidelines as he was in January, his spirit was certainly present. As former accessories designers under Mr. Valentino, the incumbent duo are keenly aware of the house codes, and today they adhered rather dutifully to the ladylike sensibility for which these clothes have always been known.</p><p>Elaborating on several of the ideas they presented in their sixties-inflected couture collection, Chiuri and Piccioli showed sleeveless sheaths and coats with fan pleating below the ribs, some accented with a jeweled brooch. There were evening coats with gradated crystal beading, deep fox-fur cuffs and hems replacing couture's feathers. Cocktail dresses and gowns, meanwhile, featured draped and shirred bodices, but despite bold colors like emerald, golden yellow, and turquoise, they erred on the staid side. The same goes for those camel and bordeaux cape-backed lunch suits. A long leopard-spot cape with a wide band of fur at the hem had a younger feel.</p><p>Overall, capturing the youth vote with this collection will prove a challenge. Mr. Valentino, of course, was popular with ladies of a certain age, but he always was—and continues to be—quite tapped in with the fabulous crowd. In order to move the label forward as the new designers' mandate requires, a little less reverence for the past and a little more attention to what the palazzo set is wearing now will be in order.</p></div>"
244,fall,2009,f2009,vanessa-bruno,"<em>Ethereal</em>, not <em>edgy</em>, has always been Vanessa Bruno's adjective. For Fall, though, she's joined the urban-warrior brigade—having judged, apparently, that breezy chiffon layers and lots of skin weren't quite the thing in which to face down 2009's harsh new realities.</p><p>Opening the show were navy ribbed sweaters with military-looking gold fringe on the shoulders, worn with leather leggings and suede wrap skirts (there was a lot of action at the hips). Closing it were dresses with bodices that were Rodarte-like collages of black tulle, gold dots, and basket weave. Sandwiched in between were the sorts of colorful pieces that her legions of fans and international retailers love: a golden hammered-silk blouse and gray high-waisted trousers accompanied by a dark-green leather obi; a Lurex-shot violet dress; and a wine-red coat that she accessorized with knee-high black leather spats. Plain old pretty wasn't on Bruno's agenda this season, which puts her (a bit too) squarely in the middle of things.</p></div>"
245,fall,2009,f2009,vena-cava,"""If we were acoustic before, now we're digital,"" said Sophie Buhai, applying an apt metaphor to the evolution of Vena Cava (which she designs with Lisa Mayock) from pretty and print-strewn to sparkly and somewhat darkly punkish. As if to drive home the point, bedazzling shreds of 30,000 CDs repurposed by the artist Marisa Tesauro filled the inside of a triangular show platform that supported 21 models in specially created Via Spiga shoes and clothes that were all grown-up sexy.</p><p>Titled ""Crystalarium,"" the collection was inspired by a neighbor of Mayock's who worked as a ""gem huntress"" in the eighties. Back were the tough leggings and the signature long dresses with cutouts showing slices of skin; new this season were motorcycle jackets, exposed zippers, studs, holographic sequins, and metallic fringe.</p><p>Holographic sequins might sound like a chancy move, but these girls have never played with fool's gold. The CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund award runners-up for 2008 have great sell-through with their ""wearable novelties,"" as they phrase it, so for Fall they focused on adding ""never-seen-before detailing"" to familiar silhouettes and staples, making the ordinary quite a bit more extraordinary. There were perhaps fewer surprises than some might have liked, but the show was easy to take a shine to.</p></div>"
246,fall,2009,f2009,vera-wang,"Vera Wang moved her show from the Bryant Park tents to the more intimate confines of her new Soho boutique, and the change of venue, coupled with the new economy, clearly had her rethinking her aesthetic. Wang is New York's most romantic designer, but for Fall she stripped her clothes of most of the glittering embellishments she usually favors. That's not to say they didn't deliver plenty of sensory pleasures. The close quarters of her store were the perfect place to appreciate the liquid-y, ripplelike effect of the Fortuny-inspired black moiré organza she used for off-the-shoulder dresses and coats, and to hear the swish-swish of a navy techno stretch skinny pant worn with a tie-front jacket.</p><p>Overall, there was a severity to the collection that felt new. It came across through the scuba material she used for a stiff, front-pleat A-line skirt; a spare, long-sleeved coat; and, most intriguingly, corset belts that cinched the waists of a meringuelike organza dress and a crinkle cotton shirt and stretch pant look. Tank dresses, one in gray silk with cardinal red sequins and another in purple brocade with navy and gray sequins, were among the few departures from a predominantly black palette (and the most obvious allusions to her stated theme, the art patron Peggy Guggenheim and her life in Venice). Wang has always been about the arty/pretty mix; this time around, arty trumped pretty. That could win her some new fans, and should her loyalists object to the austerity, there's still plenty of her signature sparkly crystal and ribbon jewelry to go around.</p></div>"
247,fall,2009,f2009,vera-wang-lavender-label,"Vera Wang has positioned her Lavender Label collection to be as recession-proof as possible. When the designer mentioned prices at the informal presentation she held in her 39th Street showroom on Friday, there were shrieks of joy from the assembled buyers. ""It's a bit of mod mixed with medieval, and everything can be mixed and matched,"" Wang added. Key pieces included a blazer and an armorlike top made from a foam-backed, techno-quilted jersey, and embroidered satin tabards that were more King Street than King Arthur. A new footwear line that includes biker-inspired ankle boots with harnesses and oiled leather brogues, among other options, likewise offers high-end detail and construction at a very friendly price point.</p></div>"
248,fall,2009,f2009,veronique-branquinho,"Guests were greeted by small white-leather envelopes perched atop dust bags marked ""Delvaux."" Veronique Branquinho, the Belgian designer, has recently been named the luxury-goods house's artistic director. Presumably that means her own nearly 12-year-old label will benefit from an influx of cash—which would surely come in handy in a climate like this one. Tellingly, she had traded in her former show venue, a gloomy third-arrondissement garage, for a well-lit new space.</p><p>Location aside, this was a fairly typical Fall for Branquinho, mixing masculine and feminine elements and weaving a lot of knitwear in with the tailoring and drapery. (Among the sweaters, a chunky hand-knit cream-colored knee-length cardigan stood out.) While others have shown an awful lot of black on their runways in the past few weeks, she worked predominantly in shades of white and ivory, an optimistic choice that may make this collection a beacon for buyers.</p><p>At the top of their list? An ivory smoking jacket with satin lapels worn with a long, narrow charmeuse skirt (hemmed with Mongolian lamb) that looked like a winner in the runway-to-reality stakes.</p></div>"
249,fall,2009,f2009,veronique-leroy,"Backstage, Véronique Leroy explained the look of her Fall show as ""<em>précaire de luxe</em>""—that is, very roughly translated, ""hobo deluxe,"" someone precariously living the lush life who could lose it all in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The luxury element was clear. The designer's haute bums mixed their crystal-edged brown tweed coats and jackets with high-waisted leopard-print pants or laser-cut eyelet skirts. Dresses came with high necks, strong shoulders, and long sleeves, with a whiff of the eighties that was echoed in a gray funnel-neck coat.</p><p>Where the hobo bit came in was tougher to suss out. Maybe it was all that laser-cutting—not only on a high-necked eyelet blouse and long skirt, but also later on a leopard dress and a longish man's jacket and vest in tweed. It's anybody's guess how the crystal-studded miniature dogs perched on the models' shoulders fit the story line; in any case, Fifi and Lulu probably won't find too many real-world owners. As for the clothes, they'll stand a better chance sans the holes.</p></div>"
250,fall,2009,f2009,versace,"If one person in Milan could have gone back to the eighties with full credentials—massive shoulders, Day-Glo, disco-mania, and all—it would have been Donatella Versace. Full marks to her, then, for refusing. Her collection, like the woman herself, has long moved on. These days, she still drapes a slinky, liquid dress with much of the mastery Gianni achieved in his time, but any real compulsion to look back at the good old days has evaporated. There was, it's true, a quick flash of neon somewhere in there, but mostly Versace concentrated on working around metallics—silver, gunmetal, dark gray, and midnight blue—and palest neutrals. Decorated trenches, super-skinny cargo pants, and the odd biker jacket appeared for day, the only embroidery subtly streaked onto the hemline of a coat. No bling, no gold, no logos in sight.</p><p>Restrained wasn't quite the word for it, though. Daywear out of the way, Versace dealt out dress after dress, long and goddess-y or short and covered in plastic paillettes. Best in class were the one red dress and a nude, bugle-beaded gown, fit for a thirties movie siren. It all went on a bit too long, but funnily enough that gave time for the eye to observe some changing aesthetics. Noticeably, it was the girls who could fill out the dresses who looked best in these clothes—and knew it. To see Carmen Kass, Coco Rocha, Isabeli Fontana, and the newly (slightly more) curvy Lily Donaldson work these dresses with visible confidence was an encouraging reminder that, yes, some things can get better with age.</p></div>"
251,fall,2009,f2009,victoria-beckham,"Quite possibly the only person who hasn't been surprised by the success of Victoria Beckham's new dress line is the celebrity designer herself. Back at the Waldorf Towers, where she's showing her 23-piece sophomore collection by appointment, she spoke just as earnestly about under-bust contouring, channel seaming, and zippers that unzip from top and bottom as she did last September. But these dresses look so well-made, so of-the-moment yet also timeless (""which is so important, especially these days,"" Beckham acknowledged) that they do the talking for her. The fits-like-a-glove sheath made a reappearance, this time in soft gray cashmere with little cap sleeves. New to the mix were short day dresses in black stretch wool felt, above-the-knee cocktail numbers in gold tinsel bouclé, and gowns in crepe or matte sequins with elegant trains. (Capes in felt or silk gazar were also a new category for Beckham, but they didn't quite have the need-it-now quality of her frocks.) The one-shoulder floor-grazing black gown with chenille and metallic details, or maybe the long-sleeved red marocain with grosgrain belt, should get shipped out to L.A., and quickly. The latter's padded shoulders and corseted waist could work their elongating, slimming magic on some lucky star come Oscar night.</p></div>"
252,fall,2009,f2009,viktor-rolf,"With Greco-Roman sculptures as a backdrop, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren sent out a Fall collection based on classical draping. It's become an important trend this season, but leave it to the eccentric Dutchmen to tweak it mightily. They swagged liquid jersey to create suits that resembled nothing if not theater curtains, but preferred mostly to carry out their experiments with stiff woolens in shades of off-white, stone, loden, and black. The folds that decorated the opening coat looked as immobile as those you might see on the marble muse <em>Melpomene</em> at the Louvre. On other pieces, like a vest and a long skirt, they seemed to have been pressed flat: 3-D decorations rendered in 2-D. Even more peculiar was a long skirt faceted like diamonds, made from a leaden material reminiscent of concrete.</p><p>To be clear, there were some elegant pieces—notably a soft gray dress topstitched in a trompe l'oeil style to evoke ruffles, or the printed silk chiffon shirtdresses—and these have a plausible future off the runway. But with the models' faces and necks whitened, the better to resemble the statues behind them, the concept obscured the clothes.</p></div>"
253,fall,2009,f2009,vivienne-tam,"Vivienne Tam's closely edited collection for Fall focused mainly on cocktail dresses; a few skirts, a couple of blouses, and a cheongsam made up the rest. ""I always wear dresses,"" the designer said by way of explanation. ""I'm not really a pants person."" Those frocks, for the most part, were lovely, though Tam faltered by overworking some until they became more wearable art than ready-to-wear. Her inspiration this season was the Chinese character for nothingness—a piece of art in its own right—which Tam was drawn to for its graphic appeal, as well as its message of cleanliness and starting afresh. The character appeared, in some form or another, on almost all of her 20 looks. While at times its use was too literal—a purple sheath dress made entirely from characters on rounds of laser-etched silk charmeuse looked uncomfortable to wear—the abstract renderings of the symbol were skillfully done.</p></div>"
254,fall,2009,f2009,vivienne-westwood,"When Vivienne Westwood was complimented recently on last season's Red Label showing, she replied with typical can't-help-herself candor that she actually had nothing to do with it. In which case, whoever is channeling her is doing a pretty good job of duplicating her signature. The corseting, the asymmetry, the tartans, the tailoring, the general air of wanton womanliness that is personified by Pamela Anderson, the new face of the business…they can all be found in Red Label.</p><p>This particular edition went slack toward the end with one too many asymmetrically draped jersey dresses, which looked cheap. But before that moment, a tweed jacket with dimpled shoulders, a poncho-dress hybrid (droncho?) in olive green, and some capacious hooded winter wraps had an air of downplayed drama. The collection offered its own twist on the perennial naughty schoolgirl look with a tiny striped jacket and fiercely tailored pants (better make that ""naughty schoolboy""). The invitation was a school report card. Seeing the sun is shining, we'll give this effort a B-.</p></div>"
255,fall,2009,f2009,vpl,"Deconstructing classic pieces and putting them back together a little askew, Victoria Bartlett played with shapes this season. Seaming on knits formed new contours, and there were unexpected openings here and there—as on a pair of long, turtleneck sweater dresses slit all the way up the sides—that allowed the designer's signature underpinnings to peek through.</p><p>While bandagelike back-brace belts left some models looking like they'd suffered a serious injury, the majority of the looks were well-made, slightly off-kilter basics. And that's something customers are investing in more and more these days.</p></div>"
256,fall,2009,f2009,william-rast,"It takes a lot of chutzpah for any designer to show right before Marc Jacobs, but the William Rast design quartet, fronted by Justin Timberlake, seriously aspires to make a mark on American fashion. (In deference to MJ, though, Team Rast did start punctually enough to leave some editors stranded outside.)</p><p>The Fall collection, shown in Bryant Park, trumpeted a ""New America,"" while simultaneously conjuring up celluloid visions of Americana from <em>Thelma &amp; Louise</em> and <em>Rumble Fish</em>. In practice, the gist of these clothes is to recast nostalgic classics with a road-trip bent—the perfect pair of second-skin patchwork jeans; the little leather motorcycle jacket, now in dark gray with sleeves full of brass rivets; the denim mini dressed up with chunks of jet beading. Like Spring, the label's debut season, this was very much a denim collection, and it kept a laserlike focus on the skinny jean. Perhaps Timberlake and co. are thinking evolution, not revolution? That is a respectable strategy, but in an era when celebrities have indeed become wholly viable capital-F fashion designers, Timberlake and his creative directors, Johan and Marcella Lindeberg, should feel unconstrained to push further out into the fashion sea.</p></div>"
257,fall,2009,f2009,wunderkind,"Wolfgang Joop's Fall Wunderkind collection was inspired by Suprematism, the early-twentieth-century Russian abstract art movement founded by Kazimir Malevich, as well as by the work of contemporary German artist Gregor Törzs. The results are a strong argument that art is often better left on walls. Malevich's rectangle and square paintings became the basis for a colorful geometric print that appeared on chiffon dresses. Worn with matching tights or sequined leggings stitched in the same graphic pattern, the frocks were quite an eyeful. Törzs' depictions of cheetahs and deer, meanwhile, were printed onto wool coats, which detracted from the garments rather than elevating them. In fact, the strongest looks in the collection were the first ones to hit the runway. These showed Joop's prowess as a tailor, and, with their padded hips and on-trend forties power shoulders, suggested he does possess the ability to design relevant clothes.</p></div>"
258,fall,2009,f2009,y-3,"Spoiler alert: Not only was Yohji Yamamoto in the house, but for the first time ever the master took a turn on the runway, trailed like a pied piper by a crowd of children. (No, the darling little people weren't there merely to warm your hard heart. Yes, Y-3 is adding children's apparel.) But let's rewind a little. The love child of Yohji and Adidas returned to the windswept venue of Pier 40. Last go-round, there was a wall of ice as the backdrop; this time, the ice had melted into a bright abstract expressionist square painted by the Brooklyn artist MOMO, who also lent his handiwork to some of the clothes, tagging a few black blazers and a pair of jeans. But that, perhaps surprisingly, was as arty as the show got.</p><p>Sharply executed, the collection featured a dark, menswear-y mix, with the usual athletic details playing a subtle second fiddle (with the notable exception of eye-popping bright white sneaks that complemented the all-black looks quite well). This was Y-3's most straightforward and commercial offering to date. But the ""c"" word is in no way meant as a dig. It actually felt like a revelation to watch Y-3's occasionally awkward dance between sports and style give way to the simple I-want-to-wear-it appeal of, say, a pitch-perfect duffel coat, punched up slightly with white toggles, or a velvet-trimmed tuxedo jacket. Most style watchers in the past have probably asked themselves, ""Well, OK, but who wears it?"" If the label keeps evolving in this direction, maybe before long the answer will be a chorus of ""Me!""</p></div>"
259,fall,2009,f2009,yigal-azrouel,"What better day than Friday the 13th to show a collection with a dark and romantic feel? Yigal Azrouël tapped into the <em>Coraline</em>/MisShapes/gothic vibe that's in the air, showing cape jackets, witchy leg-of-mutton sleeves, and tough-looking washed-cotton and leather stovepipes to the strains of Siouxsie Sioux. ""The evolution of the collection is mostly in the proportions. It's less layered than in the past. I focused on a clean and lean silhouette,"" the designer said in a preshow interview. In fact, Azrouël has been heading in a tougher direction for a while now, but if this outing didn't stray too far from familiar territory, it offered a well-edited selection of darkly glamorous looks. Sharp were the nineties-referencing pieces with their flanges and inverted triangle shapes; less so, the knit ""Nordic"" pants and some overwrought evening looks. There were enticing cocoon-shaped knits and outerwear with which to weather the cold—and the economic crisis. Julia Stegner, sitting front-row in her role as Mercedes-Benz ambassador, approved: on her wish list is Azrouël's leather jacket and a studded jersey dress.</p></div>"
260,fall,2009,f2009,yohji-yamamoto,"How many ways can you reimagine a peacoat? If you're Yohji Yamamoto, the variations are practically infinite. This was another one of the designer's think pieces, and this time he trained his razor-sharp focus on the single item that may be absolutely recession-proof: the winter coat.</p><p>To start, it was long and black, all straight lines to the ankles, save for a jacket overlay on one side; by the end, it was red, poufed up with great swags of fabric in front; in the middle, it came double-breasted in white felt with a gauzy black trail railing behind. Other ideas he tried out included black coats with seams piped in white, and a few more with clouds of red felt fused to a big shoulder or a poufed sleeve.</p><p>Of course, it wasn't exclusively about outerwear. A long dress with raw edges made it into the lineup, as did a mannish jumpsuit and a tunic that unzipped at the back to reveal a black heart painted on the model's leg. For the finale, five girls came out together, holding hands, and formed a circle on the center of the runway. They wore five different red coats, each with fuchsia panels inset from collar to hem down the back.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""m7fc5t""></div></div><p>As conceptual as the endeavor might have been, this collection was one of Yamamoto's more wearable, full of fabulous options you don't have to be a fashion intellectual to love. More proof that he's got practicality on his mind: a collaboration with Salvatore Ferragamo that produced the show's flat skimmers in red, white, and black.</p></div>"
261,fall,2009,f2009,zac-posen,"Zac Posen is nothing if not a showman. For Fall, he enlisted the 5 Browns—a brother and sister piano troupe—to play on five Steinways arrayed down the middle of the runway, and he sent out a collection of forties-inflected Victoriana. ""They were both times of sculpting clothing,"" he said a few days before his show. Focusing mostly on dresses, sculpt is what Posen did: grand Joan Crawford shoulders, pouf sleeves, ruffles at the hips, and great swags of fabric pooling on the floor at the models' feet—in notice-me fabrics like metallic jacquards, violet moiré silk, double-layer floral prints, and a gingersnap plaid.</p><p>Off-key? Many would say so. Posen has had some fabulous red-carpet successes lately, most notably Kate Winslet in a figure-hugging black floor-length number at the BAFTAs. There was a time in the not too distant past when he put that kind of attainable glamour on his catwalk. But too often these days he errs on the side of melodrama. That said, there were some appealing pieces. Alek Wek's gray wool cap-sleeved day sheath and a Venetian blue silk gown with a draped bodice and a bare back both struck the right note.</p></div>"
262,fall,2009,f2009,zero-maria-cornejo,"The Obama bump was in full force at the Robert Miller Gallery, where Maria Cornejo's show was crowded with full editorial and retail teams and plenty of important people with the word ""director"" in their titles. ""Of course it's had an effect,"" said Cornejo, backstage beforehand, of the inauguration-bound First Lady's having chosen to wear Zero aboard the whistle-stop Obama Express.</p><p>Fittingly, Fall was designed for a ""strong but positive"" woman, Cornejo said. The feel-good inspirations behind the collection (her cat, Grace Jones, and drives upstate) may have sounded like a bit of an odd mix, but there was nothing discordant about the image that hit the runway: a lean and elegant urban warrior look, not a defiant one, but a sophisticated and pragmatic tough cookie who needs the protection of a sleek, luxe cocoon. Despite the designer's protestations that this was a light and optimistic season, there were lots of dark clothes here. But that's OK: Cornejo's blacks are never basic, whether it's a directional silhouette or an unusual texture that clicks them up several notches. And the rich browns are the kind of hue that makes you wish winter wouldn't end—particularly if you've bought one of the shearling vests that sent a ripple of approval through the crowd.</p><p>Dresses are a Cornejo lover's staple. This time, in easy silks printed with that aforementioned feline's face or a jewel-tone pattern that looked like the cross section of a geode, they tempered the brooding, layered, and hooded mood. ""There's lightness in the dark,"" said Cornejo. Well, now there's also a spotlight, and Cornejo proved herself worthy of it.</p></div>"
263,fall,2009,f2009,3-1-phillip-lim,"Thanks for asking, but business is just dandy in the Land of Lim, an exotic place where sell-throughs are strong, and where wait lists and reorders really do exist. ""People still like the prices,"" reported Lim a few days ago in his studio. (That wait list, by the way, is for Spring's zipper dress.) His packed-to-the-rafters show (with Kanye and Amber Rose in attendance) clearly reflected his all-is-good state of affairs. Under the runway set of an illuminated arch, hipster singer Lissy Trullie and her band played live throughout. Spinning 180 degrees from last Fall when talk centered on growing up, this season Lim embraced the youthquake of sixties London, with all its vast attendant visual territory to mine: Biba, Ossie Clark, Granny Takes a Trip, Jimi Hendrix, Sergeant Pepper. Lim bopped easily from one influence to another, with lean Keith Richards-esque suits and groovy-glam marabou and goat-hair coats making nice with a slew of softly bohemian dresses (which will be the lazy girl's route to a fab vintage look). More than ever, Lim focused on coats. Those wishing to get their bandleader on for a nice price (and in a somewhat low-key manner) need look no further. A parka with rabbit-fur sleeves? Check. A gray breakaway shearling? Check. ""It's about fun,"" said Lim. It's also about merch—mountains of it. In need of an edit? Maybe so, but if business is good, then bring it on.</p></div>"
