1,spring,2000,s2000,alberta-ferretti,"Not one to lose touch with her clients' need for romantic, feminine clothing with an urban edge, Ferretti delivered the goods this season. Transparency was the key to her array of dreamy, girly dresses with delicate beading and ruffles in light shades of brick, green, yellow and pale blue. There were also shiny slim pants, delicate twinsets, and peasant-inspired tops and long skirts. It was a subtle, contemporary and practical collection that will keep girls looking fresh for the year 2000.</p></div>"
2,spring,2000,s2000,alessandro-dell-acqua,"She's back in style and readily available. The early '80s disco dolly came out to party in full force at Alessandro Dell'Acqua's show. Sex was clearly the driving force behind this cavalcade of one-shouldered purple, red and black tulle shirts, cowl-necked satin tops and paillette-encrusted slacks that took over the runway. Accessories were no less bold and added to the shimmering extravaganza—decorated boots, dangling rhinestone chains worn as belts or necklaces under layers of transparent fabric and bags with dripping beads. It was a strobe-light affair.</p></div>"
3,spring,2000,s2000,alexander-mcqueen,"With cheeky insouciance <strong><a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/alexander-mcqueen/"">Alexander McQueen</a></strong> dropped trou at the end of his Spring 2000 show to reveal his stars and stripes boxers. Eye was shown in New York, on a pier on the West side, and, once again, the models sloshed through water. They wore clothes that drew from active sportswear, bondage, and the Middle East; <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/model/Gisele-Bundchen"">Gisele</a>, for one, wore a tasseled and embroidered head covering with a metal-pailleted bodysuit. There was no ignoring the collection’s latent aggression when spikes rose through the water. Over those frightening points soared acrobats in burka-like shrouds, some striped red, others colored black, like good and bad angels.</p></div>"
4,spring,2000,s2000,ann-demeulemeester,"The relationship between word and image was the theme for Ann Demeulemeester's predominantly black and white collection. Bands of text with messages like ""Curious wishes feathered the air,"" and ""Morning found the field bright"" were inscribed on tank tops and jackets. Overlays of transparent tulle, sometimes decorated with subtle beading, covered Demeulemeester's well-known black pantsuits. There were also lighter pieces, like ecru papery jackets, distressed denim pants, and simple knit sweaters.</p></div>"
5,spring,2000,s2000,anna-molinari,"""Lou Lou goes on vacanza with a trunk of white and gold,"" was Rosella Tarabini's inspiration for Anna Molinari. Lou Lou also packed an assortment of prints, Pierrot dresses, floral appliqués, and every paillette she could find. Gold leather ensembles were shown alongside frilly polka-dotted dresses, ""I love you"" printed chiffon numbers, and provenç;al florals on devore velvet. Tarabini felt her collection was ""pure St. Tropez,"" but many of her pieces would certainly not be unwelcome at the colorful and extravagant festivities of Rio de Janeiro.</p></div>"
6,spring,2000,s2000,anna-sui,"""An American prairie girl goes to Goa"" would be a good way to describe Anna Sui's unapologetically rich summer collection. Her looks were at times sexy, often innocent, but always bedecked with embroidery, ruffles, beading and a rampage of colorful patterns. Western-inspired pieces like dark denim capri jeans and jackets were bejeweled and studded '70s-inspired Empire dresses were stitched from rambunctious paisley prints; and floral-print ruched blouses were in abundance. Clearly, restraint was not even a minor consideration for Sui, who went for all-out luxe.</p></div>"
7,spring,2000,s2000,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi's runway positively oozed with raw energy as he presented one of the most unapolegetically sexy collections so far. Necklines plunged, skimpy leather dresses clung to the body for dear life and flowing, floor-length evening gowns in shocking pink, orange and yellow were simultaneously old-world and unflinchingly modern. Berardi once again proved his skill at combining deft tailoring (as in his white, sharp tuxedo suits) with extravagant sensuality (silky cocktail dresses never looked better). As if that weren't enough, this time around he threw in Murano glass, vertigo-inducing ankle-cuff stilettos, Lalique jewelry and edgy headpieces by Stephen Jones.</p></div>"
8,spring,2000,s2000,as-four,"In February of 2000, As Four (Adi Gil, Angela Donhauser, Gabi Asfour, and Kai Kühne), had already defined their aesthetic as organic and curvilinear. They had put this into practice in “Human Plant,” a collection that they created and photographed to publish in <em>Zink Magazine</em>, but they hadn’t gone public with their work—aside from sometimes wearing the pieces they made. When <em>Paper</em>’s Kim Hastreiter offered them a chance to show at the Bryant Park tents as part of a sort of alt-fashion/art event she was curating, the team jumped at the chance. “We wanted to really show how we worked,” Gabi Asfour later told <em>Vogue</em>.</p><p>The result was “Puppen Couture” a magical installation of miniature As Four garments shown en masse on wind-up hula dancing dolls the quartet found on Canal Street. As they twirled in their haphazard way to Wagner, the dolls placed As Four firmly at the center of downtown New York’s fashion/art nexus.</p></div>"
9,spring,2000,s2000,badgley-mischka,"""Our collection is girly and optimistic, younger than usual, and definitely glamorous,"" explained Mark Badgley. The presentation featured nearly all the colors of the rainbow in cool sorbet shades, like light rose, lime green, and citron yellow tempered with white. Reserving their trademark glittering gowns for last, Badgley Mischka devoted the first part of the show to embroidered, shimmery separates that included wearable georgette tops, raspberry sequin skirts, and fuchsia sprinkle-beaded jackets.</p></div>"
10,spring,2000,s2000,balenciaga,"Nicholas Ghesquière continued his revival of the silhouettes Balenciaga pioneered in the '50s, and brought them up to speed (which, in this season, means going back to the '80s). Loose sack-dresses, sweaters and coats with dolman sleeves, as well as pleated pants tapered at the bottom, predominated; but there were also preppy, slim trousers with matching long-sleeved shirts and blazers. The palette was restrained for the most part: Plum, beige, and navy were the main colors.</p></div>"
11,spring,2000,s2000,balmain,"It was quite a dramatic presentation at Balmain, featuring everything from feather paste-on brassieres to rough-cut cavegirl-like skirts and microskirts, and Jackson Pollock-inspired prints. Of course, there were also plenty of more sedate pieces—pretty twinsets in pastel shades, a broad range of soft, flowing chiffon dresses and candy-colored short suits with exposed seams, perhaps influenced by Gilles Dufour's years at Chanel. Evening had a distinctly '80s flavor: Acid orange, fuchsia and green minidresses shared the runway with feathered tops, handkerchief slips with trains that served as scarves and paillette gowns. And who better to show them all off than Claudia Schiffer?</p></div>"
12,spring,2000,s2000,bcbg-max-azria,"For his Spring collection, BCBG designer Max Azria did just what he does best, distilling the season's major trends into fashion that's utterly wearable and accessible. Ecru, rust, raspberry, and mint green were the predominant shades, with floral prints and beading adding an ethnic touch. Suede skirts, dresses, and shells with appliqués looked great worn with lacquer boots and heels, while skimpy apron tops, layered multi-tulle skirts, and enamel cotton dresses embroidered with paillettes gave an extra spark to the sophisticated, sexy spirit of the collection.</p></div>"
13,spring,2000,s2000,betsey-johnson,"""Freedom Girls"" was the theme for Betsey Johnson's rambunctious, colorful presentation, set to DJ Mark Ronson's funky beats. And true to theme, the real-life models, ranging in age from ten years old to fifty something, who stalked the makeshift runway in Johnson's Seventh Avenue neon-pink and yellow showroom did radiate a sense of fashion, liberation. Johnson's signature playful prints showed up in sexy baby doll halters, micro-cardigans, peasant skirts, and simple sheath dresses. ""Farm girl"" looks mingled with western ensembles of flared jeans with ruffles, and middle eastern-inspired shawls and skirts. ""This is a celebration of personal style,"" declared Johnson, who also served as the show's emcee.</p></div>"
14,spring,2000,s2000,bill-blass,"The audience gave an enthusiastic standing ovation at the end of Bill Blass' historic final presentation. It was a well-deserved send-off for a true master of American fashion, who has decided to retire after decades of designing glorious American sportswear. His swan-song offered plenty of Blass favorites: floral organza strapless dresses, embroidered sweater and skirt sets and clean, sophisticated suits in black and ivory. There were also some fun, youthful twists in his farewell collection, including zebra-print column gowns, beaded hot pants, and bold tops and skirts in vivid shades of aqua, red and pink. It was a fitting finale for one of this country's best designers.</p></div>"
15,spring,2000,s2000,blumarine,"""Two-thousand-and-one nights: global chic"" was the inspiration for Anna Molinari's raucously festive Blumarine collection. Wandering from east to west on a magic fur-trimmed, bejeweled carpet, the designer toyed with bikinis in cashmere and sequins as evening wear; urban <em>tailleurs</em> were alternated with her signature feminine knits. Ethnic motifs appeared everywhere in the form of beaded dragon appliques, Indian-style embroidery and African zebra prints. Pushing the decoration envelope to the max, Molinari turned the rose, Blumarine's symbol, into the leitmotif for a rich series of evening dresses that dripped with waterfalls of the flower's shiny petals.</p></div>"
16,spring,2000,s2000,bottega-veneta,"Bottega Veneta showed a line of simple, easygoing separates, including shimmery coral tops, ecru leather pantsuits and beaded cardigans. But in keeping with the luxury leather house's roots, the true stars of the show were their signature handbags, which came down the runway with nearly every outfit. There were oversized carry-alls, simple clutches, and large, square hard cases in sophisticated taupe as well as spring's essential colors: lime green and pink.</p></div>"
17,spring,2000,s2000,bruce,"Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli, the girls behind Bruce, held an inspirational, glamorous and seductive presentation centered around sumptuous leather skirts and jackets, ruched tanks and no-nonsense trousers. The pieces successfully walked the fine line between avant-garde minimalism and jet-set glamour: Slate-gray satin cocktail dresses shared the runway with crocheted tops and leather pants with gathered cuffs. The sobriety of the designs extended to the classic boots and snakeskin heels that blended in perfectly with the collection.</p></div>"
18,spring,2000,s2000,burberry-prorsum,"Designer Roberto Menechetti's new take on an old British house was more feminine and fun than in previous seasons. There were sexy, double-breasted biker jackets in sueded leather that looked like they had been biking for years, cute mini dresses in a ""new"" Burberry check (it has the old camel-and-red colorway with a lino feel to the print), long, flowing skirts in iridescent lilac silk and macs in ultra-light sailcloth printed with the new check on a lilac or green background. It was an identifiably Burberry collection, but Menechetti seems to be getting closer to a modern British style.</p></div>"
19,spring,2000,s2000,byblos,"""Judo Jetson blends my favorite cartoon character with spiritual Japanese influences,"" said John Bartlett about the opening part of his Byblos show, which featured white and black linen jackets with tie waistbands, sharply tailored capri pants and asymmetrical skirts. The clean, almost clinical looks eventually gave way to an array of satin pieces with geometric designs in shades of turquoise, pink and pale blue, often paired with crisp gray pants and jackets. Bartlett's inspiration? ""The second part of the collection was all about Jackie O. on acid,"" he explained. Of course—who wouldn'ave guessed it?</p></div>"
20,spring,2000,s2000,calvin-klein-collection,"Fashion's king of minimalism showed a romantic, ethereal collection that played with almost imperceptible variations of light and pattern. Colors went from white to putty and pale blue to light gray in fabrics that were sheer and airy. Sophisticated coats and jackets were treated like redefined button-down shirts. Suits were feather-light but tailored razor-sharp, and classic dresses with built-in underwire bras brought the collection into the new millennium with the use of technologically advanced materials like micro-pinstripe opaque jersey.</p></div>"
21,spring,2000,s2000,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera took a playful turn for spring 2000, displaying a youthful, modern feeling that was balanced by her trademark ladylike sophistication. Never one to take fashion over the top, Herrera featured plenty of luscious colors, including beaded pink and chartreuse camisoles and dresses, rich Moroccan embroideries, and buttery-soft suede trousers. The evening looks brought to mind a daring debutante: citron silk crepe backless halter gowns, full taffeta skirts, and ruffled shirts paired with floor-length A-line skirts. ""The mood for 2000 is feminine, luxurious and seductive,"" explained Herrera. ""We need a lot of color and energy.""</p></div>"
22,spring,2000,s2000,celine,"Getaway glamour was the theme for Celine's striking presentation: Jennifer Lopez meets Jackie O. in St. Tropez, of course, for fun in the sun. Duran Duran blared on the speakers as Michael Kors sent out a procession of hand-bleached silk denim ensembles--a new and luxurious take on acid wash, that reliable '80s favorite, this time around with matching oversized travel bags. Dresses and tops in suede and jersey followed. The fabrics were as light and easy to wear as the colors Kors favored: watercolor blue, pale turquoise and bright chartreuse. Kors' penchant for easy luxury extended to the glove-leather vests, chrome-studded cashmere T-shirts, and crystal-encrusted sarongs--which would work equally well on the beach or as evening wear by a bonfire. The accessories were no less striking: clear Lucite bracelets, stiletto mules and, of course, logo-emblazoned totes. It was an accomplished, playful collection punctuated by Kors' trademark simplicity of design and the richness of the fabrics he employed.</p></div>"
23,spring,2000,s2000,cerruti,"Cerruti has a well-built reputation for producing classically tailored, elegant daywear in top-quality fabrics. Peter Speliopolous, who took over the creative reins from Narciso Rodriguez a couple of seasons ago, has successfully capitalized on the traditional house's strengths, and simultaneously infused the clothes with a younger attitude. This season the look was perfect for a summer picnic on the Riviera: Onionskin jerseys, feminine wraps, delicately ruched dresses, and Spanish-inspired skirts evoked a modern interpretation of an impressionist painting. Cutout designs, paillette accents, and very delicate embroidery on light, simply cut fabrics proved how the combination of American sensibility with European tradition and craft is working at Cerruti.</p></div>"
24,spring,2000,s2000,chalayan,"Looking at Hussein Chalayan's work is a bit like looking at a painting by an old master—you know immediately who painted it, and that it is the work of a great artist. This show, which opened with dresses with voluminous skirts of multiple gores, was the work of a fashion master. Chalayan displayed an incredible body of work tonight, from his perfectly executed, simple white dresses with their geometric ruffles at the armhole, to semi-opaque pink slips with frills that skimmed down the bodice of the dress and disappeared under the skirt only to reappear hanging from beneath it. There were several pieces de resistance—an inflatable orange dress that was pumped up on stage, a baby pink moulded plastic dress that was opened up by a remote control panel held by a young boy to reveal a froth of pink tulle underneath, and the grand finale - five models in deconstructed corsets in acid brights and matching pleated skirts. As they stood motionless on stage, the floor literally opened and the girls were swallowed into the depths of the theatre. A great achievement for such a young man, this is the kind of show that will go down as a unique fashion moment.</p></div>"
25,spring,2000,s2000,chloe,"The grandiose Musée du Petit Palais served as the setting for Stella McCartney’s sensual collection. Fringed, frayed, ecru denim pieces opened the show, accessorized by white boots with high heels and bold ankle cuffs. A series of interesting embroidered pieces followed—delicate colored thread formed figures of women and animals on skirts, jeans, and jackets. The collection’s underlying theme of subtle opulence was underscored by the hand-painted jerseys, diamond-embroidered pieces and 24-K-gold chains that held together some tops or served as blouses. For McCartney’s customer, luxury, evidently, comes naturally.</p></div>"
26,spring,2000,s2000,christian-dior,"Couture blaxploitation, logos-a-go-go, leather-clad revolutionaries, whip-toting modern courtesans—where else but at Dior? John Galliano's romp started with a series of wildly sexy denim looks reminiscent of a glammed-out Foxy Brown: knee-high lace-up logo boots, foulard tops made out of Dior's signature print, frayed microskirts and supersexy tan leather pants. Just when you were ready to call the vice squad, out came a parade of eighteenth-century-inspired white, black, and red corsets with lace-up skirts and leggings (asymmetrically cut and with plenty of zippers and laces, of course). Insouciant dance-hall girls in enormous coiffures, velvet ensembles, polka dots, deconstructed suede, whips and satin getups followed. It doesn't get much closer to the fantasy of couture than this—and nobody makes it more fun than Galliano.</p></div>"
27,spring,2000,s2000,christian-lacroix,"It takes a master designer like Christian Lacroix to confidently mix a dizzying array of prints and make it work. Indeed, there was not a single solid piece in Christian Lacroix's strongly decorated collection, but there were plenty of flowers, colorful patchwork, polka dots, paisleys, beading, Kabuki motifs, petal embroidery and giant leaf prints. It was a visually arresting extravaganza that captured the soft, feminine side of spring 2000. If you're in the market for a garden party dress or an eye-catching number for those long summer nights, look no further.</p></div>"
28,spring,2000,s2000,clements-ribeiro,"""It's all about dots,"" said Inacio Ribeiro, who designs with his wife Suzanne Clements, of his collection. The first look out on the runway—a floaty yellow chiffon dress covered with multicolored dots and worn over a dotted bikini—was a strong opening for the collection. There were to-die-for lily-print coats, paisley chiffon skirts decorated with cellophane discs, lean trousers tied at the waist with airy chiffon bows and the most original draped sequin tops. And no one will be able to resist the latest Clements cashmere—a twinset combining chocolate and pistachio stripes, which was shown with cropped trousers in that divine pink and peppermint lily print.</p></div>"
29,spring,2000,s2000,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo's designs are normally unsettling at first, somewhat confusing and, ultimately, incomparably beautiful. What begins as an assault on the senses slowly reveals itself as the work of a true artistic genius. For —pring 2000, Kawakubo continued her ongoing experimentation with proportions, layering, pleats and ruffles, creating some of the most original pieces of the season. Ballerina tights were stuffed with layers of chiffon that peeked sheepishly from the girls' thighs. Olive-green army jackets and fatigues were broken down and reconfigured to create flowing skirts and rumpled jackets with displaced shoulders. But at the heart of the collection was a series of shirts and dresses with unexpected abundance of texture and color. Evoking exotic flowers or intricate corals, Kawakubo piled yards of pink, fuchsia and red fabric into bundles of ruffles and pleats that dramatically redefined the silhouette. Flat surfaces suddenly blossomed into enormous volumes. Nothing old, nothing that has been done before—that's Comme des Garçons' mantra, and it's as true now as it's ever been.</p></div>"
30,spring,2000,s2000,costume-national,"""Leather and chiffon"" essentially summarizes Costume National's presentation, which did not stray far from the familiar looks of the season: simple, light, gauzy, often beaded and transparent dresses with plunging necklines and revealing backsides. In this case, they were shown alongside fitted leather coats, miniskirts, and very short suede shorts and skirts. The predominant color was black, though bursts of green, gray, and copper livened up the atmosphere.</p></div>"
31,spring,2000,s2000,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley's dancehall-inspired presentation was held at a ballroom in the New Yorker hotel, where a couple did a brief waltz as a prelude to the show. The colorful collection was divided into four categories, each with its own distinctive feel: ""Hanky Panky"" featured earth-toned and yellow floral-embroidered dresses, painted leather trousers, and cashmere sweaters. ""Acapulco Gold"" included a crisp selection of white caftans, perforated shirts and dresses, and ribbon wraps. ""Snap out of it"" consisted of ultrasexy swimsuits and Op-Art-inspired dresses in white, salmon, and blue. The conclusion was ""Get Lit,"" which showcased party dresses with miniature lights under slinky layers of lace.</p></div>"
32,spring,2000,s2000,daryl-k,"Daryl K is best known for her urban survival gear, but she also has a longstanding obsession with '70s chic. This season she reconciled the two: Daryl's devotees will be glad to know that there are still plenty of hip-hugging, low-slung trousers, hurricane jackets, dark denim skirts and no-nonsense army blousons. But the '70s influence was obvious in her patchwork silk charmeuse kimono tops, sun-ray shirts with elaborate detailing, and ultra-sexy white vintage cotton tanks paired with bikini bottoms. All the looks were shown with simple wood wedges or supple leather no-heeled boots.</p></div>"
33,spring,2000,s2000,dkny,"At Friday's late-night show, Donna Karan's diffusion line, DKNY, celebrated ""the first ten years, the first New York store, the first fragrance and the first season of the millennium."" Indeed, with Boy George spinning the background music and a bevy of celebrities in attendance, the show reeled with festive energy. Karan kept the upbeat feeling both on and off the runway: Boys and girls strutted confidently down the catwalk in flesh-colored suede and leather, orange and acid-green nylon, and snake-embossed prints. For her finale, Karan showed a series of metallic denim pieces that sent the audience out—to her party—with a bang.</p></div>"
34,spring,2000,s2000,dolce-gabbana,"Dolce &amp; Gabbana are determined to party like it's 1999 for as long as they can, and are sparing no resources to do so. A typical look from their runway included a paisley-print transparent top, embroidered tapestry microskirt with oversized diamanté buckle, leopard tights, jewel-fringed boots and a glittering choker. For those who need a little something extra, there were also plenty of polka-dotted chiffon shirts, flapper tops and skirts, oversize fur hats and bags, beaded ties and buckets of rhinestones. Not satisfied? Slip into their teetering platform shoes, throw on a bejeweled bikini and top it off with a slouchy suit with shimmery appliqués. That should do the trick!</p></div>"
35,spring,2000,s2000,donna-karan,"Spring 2000 for Donna Karan revolved around the concept of ""Fusion—between the past and the future, the body and fabrics, the ancient arts of the East and the modern pace of the West."" As usual, Karan kept the palette elementary: indigo, black, nude and ivory showed up on soft jackets, scarf-like shirts and chic suits. Paper-thin kimonos and nude-colored suedes looked clean and modern, while hand-painted floral chiffons added a sensual feeling to the evening styles.</p></div>"
36,spring,2000,s2000,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten strayed from the mainstream, as he often does, and showed a strong and directional line for Spring 2000. ""I wanted to create a collection about passion and love, something to prove that intensity is not necessarily about women with tight clothes and high heels,"" he explained. Instead, Van Noten created visions of femininity enveloped in voluminous skirts reminiscent of Spain and the south of France, delicately embroidered tops and wool shawls that could be wrapped asymmetrically around the body. Bright, contrasting colors added a youthful touch to the inspired designs.</p></div>"
37,spring,2000,s2000,ellen-tracy,"""There's a fresh, younger look to my collection this season,"" said designer Linda Allard before the Ellen Tracy show. ""Khaki pants and skirts are shorter, and we've incorporated a lot of color as well. The collection looks great with a sculpted, modern high heel and a simple gold link chain."" Other highlights included fire-engine red trenchcoats and shirts; linen knit tops; and jade, lilac and lavender jackets, wraps and tanks. Evening wear revolved around a colorful series of frosted beaded pants, slip dresses and long skirts in grape, cherry, yellow and pink.</p></div>"
38,spring,2000,s2000,elspeth-gibson,"Elspeth Gibson's look is as wearable as it is sweetly sexy. The dress-of-the-moment is either a white fitted broderie anglais shift or a soft silk frock printed with hot-pink flowers on a chocolate background. Sequined sweaters, lime-green chiffon skirts that dipped at the hem, gingham bikinis or skirts that revealed lots of leg, and crystal-covered halter dresses will make for a sublime summer wardrobe. Take it to St. Tropez.</p></div>"
39,spring,2000,s2000,emporio-armani,"""The Emporio Armani woman for the year 2000 is imaginative, eclectic, optimistic and self-assured,"" declared Giorgio Armani. His ideal woman, evidently, is also dressed in technologically advanced fabrics brushed with lacquered strokes; she is mad for pastels, from pink to aquamarine and sage; and she layers her clothing in a thoroughly modern way. Jackets were light and deconstructed, with simple details in contrasting color lace and snaps. Slim and refined pants were worn under semi-transparent skirts and sarongs; tanks were sexy and provocative, some with open backs, others elegant and long-sleeved. Armani's Emporio collection underscored once again the designer's uncanny ability for restrained innovation.</p></div>"
40,spring,2000,s2000,eric-bergere,"""Broadway Garnier"" was the theme for Eric Bergère's collection of <em>tailleurs,</em> flowing skirts with pleats, knit sweaters and ruched shirts. The intent may have been theatrical, but the result was '80s-inspired. There was an assortment of frayed denim pieces, shiny paisley shirts with long scarves, cocktail slips, and fringed bandeau tops. It seems as though Bergère, who is noted for the polish and sophistication of his work, was exploring new directions this season.</p></div>"
41,spring,2000,s2000,fendi,"Karl Lagerfeld presented one of the strongest collections of the season, propelling Fendi once and for all into the center of the fashion limelight. Their trademark accessories--snakeskin baguette purses, acid-colored totes and luxurious foulards--were impeccable as usual, but it was the clothes that took over the stage and captivated the audience. Lagerfeld toyed with the interaction between soft, flowing fabrics in feminine colors and shapes, and the hard-edged glamour of a Halston-clad Studio 54 diva. The result was an innovative, perfectly balanced silhouette. One-sleeved cocktail dresses, shiny patent leather with lace detailing, logo-emblazoned suits, sexy chiffon dresses, enormous driving sunglasses and futuristic metallic heels make up the wardrobe of the modern Fendi woman--a sophisticate who feels equally at home sipping cocktails at a garden party in Milan, attending a gala in New York or nightclub-hopping until dawn in Los Angeles.</p></div>"
42,spring,2000,s2000,genny,"Josephus Thimister successfully brought his sense of lofty experimentation to Genny in a collection inspired by Martha Graham's philosophy of dance. The emphasis was on body movement and the synergy between grace and strength. This became apparent through Thimister's choice of fabrics—fluorescent leather trousers and silk jersey tops contrasted with ballerina dresses in tulle and mousseline. Volume was achieved through the use of artful folds and gathering, and the palette was kept graphic and simple—black and white were the basic colors, enlivened with occasional crescendos of caramel, pink, orange and yellow. In all, Genny's show played like a well-balanced symphony of complementary opposites.</p></div>"
43,spring,2000,s2000,gianfranco-ferre,"Those who lust for the elaborate fantasy and craftsmanship of couture but who prefer prêt-à-porter will find a niche for their whimsical fantasies at Ferre. If there was ever a collection that exemplified unflinching, maximalist resolve, this is it. Ferre's background as an architect was apparent in his use of constructed bodices, grand ballroom skirts with wire underpinnings, origami-inspired dresses and dandyish suits with oversized cuffs. Decoration was, of course, a defining element for the entire collection, ranging from generous ruffles on shirts to beads on floor-grazing skirts and enormous floral appliqués on elaborate dresses. Not a collection for the faint of heart.</p></div>"
44,spring,2000,s2000,giorgio-armani,"Armani proposed a light, feminine silhouette for the new millennium, inspired by the lines and colors of Kandinsky. Sea foam, fuchsia, and lime chiffon infused his collection with a delicate dreaminess. But the Armani woman is as practical as she is ethereal, so there were also plenty of pinstriped wool pants, polished linens, and classic tops. The real innovation came in how models wore the pieces: short jackets were shown with low-waisted pants cropped at the ankle, sarongs were overlapped or doubled and floral dresses were paired with tie-dyed cashmere. Armani's explanation: ""The real woman of 2000 does not want to be hostage to the rules of fashion. She wants the freedom to create her own look with passion and a sense of self-fulfillment."" Enough said.</p></div>"
45,spring,2000,s2000,givenchy,"""Bangee sportswear with '80s influence"" could be a way of describing Alexander McQueen's show for Givenchy, staged in what was set up to look like a gymnasium complete with winner's podium and high-powered fans to blow up the models' ponytailed manes. Most of the collection was made up of tracksuits with high heels, but there was also a white leather boilersuit, sexy black pantsuits with yellow stitching, and a leather patchwork coat in brown, acid-green and white. Boxing and athletic uniform influences showed up on nylon bomber jackets, sports mesh tank dresses and blue sweaters with a sporty yellow stripe.</p></div>"
46,spring,2000,s2000,gucci,"Sex sells, and no one knows that better than Tom Ford, who declared that Spring 2000 was about ""Farrah Fawcett and Blondie, with a touch of Gwyneth Paltrow."" Indeed, Gucci's catwalk sizzled with glamorous vixens swathed in python prints, leather trainer pants and sparkling jersey dresses—a movie star's dream wardrobe, circa 1979. This is certainly not the time to be shy with your clothing. Ford also showed leather jumpsuits, fitted pants with flared legs, strappy bathing suits with barely-there running shorts, and super-shiny shirts worn unbuttoned under fitted jackets. Bright-pink hosiery, stone-encrusted sandals and oversized sunglasses underscored the rock-star dimension of the unbridled glamfest.</p></div>"
47,spring,2000,s2000,helmut-lang,"Lang played with tailoring and flouthroughout this collection, and sometimes within a single outfit. Erin O’Connor, for example, wore jeans and a single-breasted topper from which floated a sheer panel. Shorts and sleeveless dresses had balloon hems, and feathers sprouted from heels of shoes. Bombshell Stephanie Seymour looked every inch the lady in a short and stunning off-the-shoulder dress.</p></div>"
48,spring,2000,s2000,hermes,"A so-called “conceptual” designer, Martin Margiela was focused on transforming objects (upcycling) and linking the present and the past as he had observed his mother doing with restored furniture. For his own line, he had famously resized vintage doll clothing to human proportions. At Hermès, the designer’s attachment to the past was less visually marked and more connected with tradition. Curator Kaat Debo notes an exception when she explains that the very dapper and practical-looking detachable saddle pockets shown for Spring 2000 were inspired by the removable pockets worn with 18th-century pannier gowns.</p><p>With its striped sweaters, espadrilles, and a classic-looking trench, this comfortable and contemporary collection had a subtle French inflection that was directed at the modern Parisienne, not latter-day Marie Antoinettes. In fact, although Margiela consistently eschewed the obvious markers of status associated with Hermès, he publicly nodded to the history of the house by including in his runway cast the style icon Jane Birkin, who gave her name to one of the house’s best-selling bags.</p></div>"
49,spring,2000,s2000,iceberg,"Iceberg, which was brimming with youthful energy, was inspired by the topic of love. Lilac, orange, red, gold and white were the colors of choice for a broad range of silhouettes--there were '70s flared pants with appliqués, macro and miniskirts, Chaplinesque trousers and elaborate knits, most with glittering paillettes thrown in for good measure. It was a lighthearted collection that should easily find a niche in Iceberg's new Las Vegas boutique.</p></div>"
50,spring,2000,s2000,jean-colonna,"Colonna's idea of chic is certainly not that of the haute bourgeoisie: Instead think smoky nightclubs, too much to drink and illicit romances. His slinking sensibility showed up this season in fringed, semi-destroyed denim ensembles, belted handkerchief tops with lace insets, net T-shirt dresses and paillette-trimmed rock 'n' roll ensembles with revealing slashed cutouts. Without forgoing all the hard-edged glitz, Colonna also featured some of his trademark favorites--sweaters with exposed seams, deconstructed layering and reconfigured garments.</p></div>"
51,spring,2000,s2000,jean-paul-gaultier,"<em>The Love Boat</em> was Jean Paul Gaultier's inspiration for a campy cruise through vacation wear. His island runway came complete with sand, leaves, a palm tree and a little pond for models to take a dip. Vampish ocean-liner mavens with '70s coiffures opened the show with an array of boldly printed tops adorned with silk-screened faces. Recalling a tropical paradise, flowing white dresses with ruffled hems and sleeves followed. Meanwhile, some girls were fortunate enough to have with them those shipwreck essentials: cut-off shorts and miniskirts worn over bloomers. The sweet maidens were soon overcome by romantic pirates toting foulards, bandeau tops and tulle chemises. How did it all end? Glamour to the rescue, of course, in the form of black long dresses gathered at the waist and acid-colored chiffon gowns.</p></div>"
52,spring,2000,s2000,jeremy-scott,"Jeremy Scott's presentation was a brilliant finale for the collections--and a witty reply to all his detractors, who had accused him in the past of producing outlandish clothing that no one would wear. Scott encapsulated--and took a step further--the dominating themes of the season: easy luxury, '80s references and working woman sexiness. His show opened with a series of strong-shouldered tan trenches, wrap dresses and blazer suits. ""Perfect for power lunches or PTA meetings,"" said Scott, who acted as emcee. Sharply commenting on the current branding craze, Scott also produced his own series of travel totes, bags and clutches, and emblazoned them all with his name. After a long day at the office, the girls needed to relax on the tennis court, of course, wearing skimpy powder-blue knit-wrap dresses, sports jackets with removable sleeves and campy visors. And for evening wear, Scott proved that aside from biting humor and talent, he's also got plenty of spunk left. His ""Atlantis divas"" were clad in nearly pornographic pastel chiffon, reminiscent of a Swedish blue-movie starlet circa 1980. Vive <em>l'avant-garde</em>!</p></div>"
53,spring,2000,s2000,jil-sander,"Jil Sander's strength has always been her self-assured simplicity of design. This season she experimented with a lighter, more feminine silhouette that included floral patterns and western shirts. Skirts had gathered waistbands; some dresses featured sash-like pleats on the front. Sander's softer side came through in the lacy chiffons and cottons she used, and in her precise use of color. The runway evoked a procession of sculptural cascades in black and white, with sporadic flashes of brown, beige, rose and yellow.</p></div>"
54,spring,2000,s2000,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart is known for translating the trends for her youthful clientele, making fashion fun and wearable. And her Spring 2000 collection was no exception: Comfortable, frilly tees were worn over jeans with heart-shaped pockets and embroidered detailing. There were also funky white leather bomber jackets, candy-pink camisoles and mint micro-shorts. For evening, Stuart showed pretty pastel column gowns with strappy high-heeled thong sandals that added a sexy footnote.</p></div>"
55,spring,2000,s2000,john-bartlett,"""Charo Meets Che"" was the title of John Bartlett's coed show, inspired by photographer and Mexican revolutionary Tina Modotti. Bartlett's ""Guerrilla Ballerinas"" stormed the runway wearing rust and brown leather slim pants with side laces, bomber jackets, and silk chiffon wrap tops. More formal looks followed, including a black twill luggage coat, georgette pants with gold beading, and gathered nude silk sleeveless tunics.</p></div>"
56,spring,2000,s2000,john-galliano,"Another wild tour de force for Galliano—this time, a musical rundown of the century, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, of course. Dandyish zoot suits—Mafioso style—were shown with spacelike silver overcoats, hats, and bags. Fifties crinolines followed: Galliano's take on romance and innocence, and the beginning of rock. Gingham prints, floral appliqués and extravagant pink volumes alternated with punk and hip-hop inspired getups: combat boots, bondage straps (albeit covered in paillettes) and slashed dresses. Galliano's main virtue is his whimsical ability to retrace and appropriate different periods of fashion history. It wasn't always easy to grasp all the references, but the extravagant and accomplished creations left the audience reeling in their seats.</p></div>"
57,spring,2000,s2000,julien-macdonald,"Macdonald's talent lies with knitwear and fiber, and he didn't let his fans down. Out came PVC jeans decorated with silver studs, plasticlike fabrics painted with pale pinks and blues, a golden sweater with woven-in crystals so it sparkled, and sweaters in lime, fuchsia and silver stripes. Very disco, very out there. Very Julien.</p></div>"
58,spring,2000,s2000,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s collection was nothing short of an epiphany: one of those rare fashion moments when creative genius, artistic integrity, and down-to-earth sensibility come together as one. The show opened with two girls running down the rained-on runway, protected only by their dainty foulards and beautifully simple shift robes. Each took turns unfastening the seams on the sides and turning the front of her dress onto itself, revealing a different color and print—in fact, two looks in one. Blending function and delicate beauty was the leitmotiv for Watanabe’s entire presentation. There were waterproof skirts (equipped with a hidden protective plastic layer), wrap-around scarves that upon closer inspection proved to be attached to a dress or skirt, gloriously pleated wraps and futuristic headpieces. It was a seamless display of refinement, architectural construction and clarity of vision that relied on technologically advanced fabrics and techniques coupled with Watanabe’s impeccably pure sense of style.</p></div>"
59,spring,2000,s2000,lanvin,"Cristina Ortiz presented a subtle yet striking collection for Lanvin, with her famously slim, sleek trousers taking center stage. They were done in black, lilac, red and cocoa, in fabrics ranging from canvas to leather to coated cotton. The highlight was a stunning beaded pair that faded from hazelnut to green. Ortiz also created sharp leather jackets, fitted shirtdresses, and practical jacquard dresses with ruched necks and waistlines. For her finale, Ortiz sent out a series of colorful evening gowns with appliqués resembling glittering broken tiles.</p></div>"
60,spring,2000,s2000,lawrence-steele,"Amid the sea of dainty decoration that has been the prevailing theme for Spring 2000 so far, Lawrence Steele's raw, sexy collection added a welcome dose of unadulterated energy. Models reminiscent of Helmut Newton's '70s glamour girls strutted down the catwalk wearing graphic black-and-white animal prints, studded skirts and transparent tops. Striking leather jackets and dresses were set off by accents of shocking pink and orange; detailing included large paillettes, feathers and gold piping on bare-back dresses. Steele offered the perfect look for those late nights you can't remember too well the next morning.</p></div>"
61,spring,2000,s2000,loewe,"White was the overwhelmingly dominant color at Loewe, with sporadic splashes of tan, sapphire, and yellow. Buttery leathers and suedes gave an opulent edge to form-fitting jeans, sexy jumpsuits and beaded overcoats. There were also delicate shift dresses, practical vests with zippers and python ensembles. For evening, Narciso Rodriguez showed a series of suede and leather dresses encrusted with glittering crystals. Overall, it was an unencumbered, consistent collection that did not forget Loewe's tradition of simple and luxurious chic.</p></div>"
62,spring,2000,s2000,louis-vuitton,"It was a veritable tour de force for Marc Jacobs who, after showing his own line in New York, presented an impressively honed collection for Louis Vuitton. Travel and luxury have always been essential components of the Vuitton allure, and this season it looks like jet-setters will feel equally at home on their way to a safari in Africa or hopping on the Concorde between New York and Paris. Canvas skirts, trenchcoats, and jackets stamped with LV's mini-monogram were reminiscent of a luxury-starved colonial explorer's uniform, as were the wool denim pieces and oversize bags. For more urban tastes, Jacobs produced a series of fluid silk jersey dresses with graphic prints, gold skirts and coats, and cashmere tops with scarves. The overall feeling was of easy, eminently wearable chic—adornment was restricted to very subtle diamond stitching on pants and skirts, and occasional embroidery on tanks and evening gowns.</p></div>"
63,spring,2000,s2000,maison-martin-margiela,"This was the first of a pair of shows focused on overblown proportions applied to wardrobe staples like trenchcoats, men’s shirts, bombers, and slip dresses, all of which were enlarged by 148, 150, or 200 percent.  But size wasn’t Margiela’s only concern for Spring ’00: Carefully placed price stickers and electronic security tags  commented on the marketing and selling of fashion, as well. What the de-heeled  shoes were meant to say is less clear. The collection was served up not on a runway but, commented <em><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/10/style/review-fashion-from-kittens-to-kilts-to-hacked-heels.html"">The New York Times</a></em>, “on round tabletops in a room that looked set up for a Rotarian dinner.”</p></div>"
64,spring,2000,s2000,marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs has long been a fashion-insider favorite, and with his collection, shown late Monday night at the New York Armory, he once again proved why. His Spring 2000 line is sure to become one of the most important collections of the season. The mood of the clothes was evocative of a California surfer girl on holiday in a Parisian discotheque circa 1979: canvas trousers with green and red piping were paired with poor boy cashmere T-shirts; Nimes denim pants, sundresses, and skirtsuits looked crisp and fresh with striped gauze tops. The clean and simple lines were thrown occasional accents—like paillette trimming on green cotton satin pea jackets, spotted dresses, and striped trousers. The overall feeling: effortless, understated chic.</p></div>"
65,spring,2000,s2000,marni,"Marni's presentation relied on youthful and easy-to-wear dresses and separates in bright pink, green and yellow over white and beige. Polka dots and abstract motifs in light cotton dominated, but there were also flowing country-girl skirts with subtle embroidery and traditional gingham prints. The translucent layering of light fabrics added a playful touch to the feminine silhouette. The look was completed with flat shoes and boots—some of which were also decorated with eye-catching polka dots.</p></div>"
66,spring,2000,s2000,martine-sitbon,"Sitbon gathered many of the season's predominant themes and reworked them into her own collection: Transparent fabrics layered with shine, paillette appliqués, fringed trims, and pleating all showed up in her work. Leather skirts with geometric patchwork inserts were interesting, and there were a few easy-to-wear trench coats. The colors were mostly rosy pastels, black and white, but a series of pieces, reminiscent of the Russian deconstructivists, incorporated red and aqua insets as well.</p></div>"
67,spring,2000,s2000,matt-nye,"Designer Matt Nye's sophomore show featured a coed collection centered around navy sailor pants, fitted jackets and simple cotton polo shirts. The theme seemed to be a cross between sophisticated urban staples and relaxed resort wear: There were waterproof ponchos, drawstring paratrooper pants, nautical tees, and boat-neck pullovers. Levi's 501s and Converse sneakers added a classically retro touch to the overall look.</p></div>"
68,spring,2000,s2000,matthew-williamson,"Take a London girl and send her on a trip—through Bali, Goa, and Ibiza—and you have Matthew Williamson's glamorous and seductive vision of a well-dressed gypsy. Williamson's hot fringed-at-the-bottom red suede dress, hand-painted white leather frock and sari tops decorated with neon embroidery and glistening sequins were instant hits. Watch out for his photo print T-shirts covered with jeweled flowers and the newest take on the vest top—purple cashmere with a neon-yellow trim at the arm. Hot stuff for the well-heeled downtown girl.</p></div>"
69,spring,2000,s2000,max-mara,"Khaki, burgundy, lavender, and navy blue were the predominating colors at MaxMara. It was a simple, controlled collection that worked—thanks to the precision of the form-fitting pantsuits, sexy shorts, and luxurious denim ensembles. Studded overcoats, pleated skirts and transparent shirts were both practical and sharp; graphic sweaters with geometric motifs, and a series of shiny pink snakeskin pieces added a dash of excitement to the runway. The chemisiers, smoky glasses, skinny belts, and fitted blazers confirmed that 70s glamour is here to stay—at least for a while.</p></div>"
70,spring,2000,s2000,michael-kors-collection,"""Palm Bitch"" was the inspiration for Michael Kors's extravagant and luxurious cavalcade of tangerine, lemon and bright-pink looks. There were familiar Kors favorites like jersey shifts (this time in Lilly Pulitzer-like acid-colored floral patterns) and sumptuous cashmere cable pullovers in bright yellow and white. Buttery leather skirts were embroidered and paired with simple tanks, while zebra prints made unexpected appearances in everything from cotton shifts to bikinis and cabana shirts. For an evening of uncomplicated glamour, Kors offered slinky jersey columns, nude beaded gowns and seafoam-colored halters.</p></div>"
71,spring,2000,s2000,missoni,"A continuous flow of color and patterns in light fabrics was the key design element for Angela Missoni, whose signature prints looked better than ever in this season filled with decoration. It was a feminine collection defined by soft forms and geometric, colorful patterns. Optical waves of yellow, turquoise, orange and lime suggested a seaside stay on Capri, while zigzag brushstrokes of black and white brought an urban touch to the mix. Evening was defined by a series of nocturnal landscapes with rhinestone appliqués on airy, chiffon knit column-dresses.</p></div>"
72,spring,2000,s2000,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada confirmed, once again, that she is one of the greatest creative talents in fashion at the moment. Her new Miu Miu line, aptly entitled ""Almost a Lady,"" was an intelligent play on the discreet charm of the modern—and young—bourgeoisie. Classic prep ensembles were reinvented with '90s shine, attitude and confidence. Pleated skirts were worn with colorful mules, baseball jackets were outfitted with patent leather detailing, and pale slacks and skirts were dressed up with diamond detailing. The looks never seemed forced or over-the-top; indeed, the collection's greatest strength was the masterful balance between embellishment and function. These are the types of clothes that women can wear everyday, anywhere, with the self-assured certainty that they'll never be underdressed—or overdone.</p></div>"
73,spring,2000,s2000,moschino,"Girls just wanted to have fun at Moschino's riotous festival of colors and prints. An assortment of references evoked everything from a psychedelic Peter Pan to a neo-dandy cabaret singer and a country-western drifter on Route 66. The runway was a no-holds-barred orgy of pirate caricature dresses, sailor pants, deluxe hippie dresses, ruffled shirts (worn with big-buckled buccaneer belts and extravagant headpieces), closely fitted waistcoats and acid-tinted snakeskin. Young sartorial divas should have no problem finding a broad selection of outfits here to drive Mother insane.</p></div>"
74,spring,2000,s2000,narciso-rodriguez,"There were no unnecessary frills at Narciso Rodriguez, whose black and white collection relied on the strength of his precise cut, layered silhouettes and subtle beading. Grecian-inspired bias jersey dresses and tops looked refined and sexy, as did his ultra-thin mohair sweaters worn over gauze tops and sleek cotton trousers. Rodriguez artfully played with a variety of transparencies and forms to create an ethereal effect: Dresses were worn over each other, and beaded cashmere gowns were paired with bias slips. But there was also an edgier side to Rodriguez's show: Leather trenches, a dress decorated with staples and a few candy-colored tops confirmed that Rodriguez can successfully address his customers' needs for sophisticated dressing, while indulging their tough-girl chic cravings.</p></div>"
75,spring,2000,s2000,nicole-miller,"""Daydreams"" was the inspiration for Miller's show, which was defined by unbridled decoration. Beaded tube tops in magenta, chartreuse and yellow were worn with georgette ruffled skirts; contrasting patterns complemented each other within the same outfit. Aqua tanks were featured alongside turquoise leopard skirts, and hand-painted organza cap-sleeved shirts were paired with crocheted skirts. Among the standout evening looks: long tartan skirts and shiny blue trousers.</p></div>"
76,spring,2000,s2000,nyc-2000,"Mayor Rudy Giuliani saluted the New York City fashion industry with an open-air show in the middle of Times Square Monday night, complete with giant TV screens and a musical performance by Grammy Award winner Trisha Yearwood. Nearly 90 designers participated, each showing only one or two looks. Models walked down a makeshift runway in rapid succession (Lauren Hutton, modeling an Armani velvet pantsuit, received an enthusiastic round of applause) as gridlock-causing crowds gathered to watch in the surrounding streets.</p></div>"
77,spring,2000,s2000,olivier-theyskens,"According to Olivier Theyskens, his Spring 2000 show, “will always remain very important because somehow I brought a lot of restriction in my choices creatively and I really worked with a very narrow palette.” Blacks, whites, and muddy tones, were brightened by splashes of white and yellow, and the designer created optical illusions working with Taroni’s outsized check and polka dot prints. Just as the models were supposed to appear lost between earth and sky as they walked on a soil-covered runway with a cloudy sky projected above them, so Theyksens was drawn both to floaty chiffons and fabrics with a heavier hand, like coated linens and others resembling a painter’s canvas.</p><p>His main jumping off point was an antique find from the early 1900s: “a very light, trench-shaped silk coat that inspired most of my tailoring with these little shirrings at the shoulder, these little curvy edges to the collars,” Theyskens says now. It wasn’t only the tailoring that was soft in this collection though; Theyskens introduced his first bias-cut pieces this season. “I loved the material first,” he recalls, “and then I just was curious how it would work; I just wanted some more fluidity.”</p></div>"
78,spring,2000,s2000,oscar-de-la-renta,"""My first collection of the millennium celebrates female strength,"" explained Oscar de la Renta. ""This is the first time in fashion history that professional women can dress very femininely and use that to their advantage."" True to his words, de la Renta showed stylishly embroidered leather skirts in camel, pink and yellow; double-faced denim pantsuits worn with cashmere shells; and Kelly-green silk and shantung dresses. For evening, there was an array of Ottoman-inspired gowns, embroidered strapless gowns, and silk tulle ballerina skirts. Oversized jewelry added the final touch.</p></div>"
79,spring,2000,s2000,philosophy,"Ferretti has always relied on youthful femininity as the inspiration for her Philosophy collections—and Spring 2000 was no exception. The predominant look was that of a sweet country girl on safari: easy-going day dresses in olive green, beige, gold and white; peasant skirts with delicate ruffles; patchwork-embroidered gauzy tops; and ultra-soft suede pants accessorized with no-nonsense rubber boots. But even the most practical-minded expeditionary craves a touch of glamour, and Ferretti delivered the goods with '60s-style gold mesh sleeveless dresses, beaded hot pants, embroidered tops, and coppery capri pants.</p></div>"
80,spring,2000,s2000,prada,"Miuccia Prada showed today what is certain to become one of the most influential and successful collections of the season. It was an exquisite show of chic and glamour, tempered by the designer's signature discretion. Burgundy shorts and sweaters, lipstick prints, polka dot shirts, leather skirts and boldly colored turtlenecks evoked a cosmopolitan panache not seen since the jet-set '70s and early '80s; some looks were accessorized with sizeable travel bags and large sunglasses. For those in search of the perfect summer robe, there were also demure, semi-transparent dresses with masterful pleats and lingerie-inspired detailing that begged for relaxed cocktails in the country. ""The ABC of fashion,"" was how Prada summed up her collection. It is precisely this knack for endowing classic, seemingly normal clothes with masterful fashion sense that keeps her empire going—and the audience begging for more.</p></div>"
81,spring,2000,s2000,ralph-lauren,"""Jackie O. meets Brigitte Bardot"" would be a fitting description for Ralph Lauren's latest collection, which featured numerous styles stitched up in gingham and polka dots. ""This is for a woman who understands how sexy simplicity can be,"" explained the ever-discerning designer. His palette was heavy on black, white and red, which showed up in taffeta pants and tops, gabardine jackets and skimpy shorts. There were also georgette floral skirts and camisoles, and sensational leather jeans. Overall, Lauren's strong collection worked beautifully by defying conventional rules.</p></div>"
82,spring,2000,s2000,randolph-duke,"It seemed only appropriate that Miss Universe and Miss America were seated front-row center at Randolph Duke's heavily bejeweled presentation. Navy blue, white and silver were the predominant colors, highlighted with sporadic bursts of maroon and powder blue. Duke drew inspiration from the Marines, picking up sailor-pant detailing on long skirts and trousers that were shown with tube knits, Celtic cable cardigans and turtlenecks. The lineup for evening was a nonstop procession of floor-length gowns lavished with beading, sequins and embroidery.</p></div>"
83,spring,2000,s2000,rebecca-danenberg,"""My collection is based on clean, nude fabrics and knits,"" said Rebecca Danenberg before her show. Danenberg's vision was clearly a sexy one, hailing back to the decadent disco days: There were filmy, mosaic-printed chiffon tops, flesh-colored leather strapless dresses, liquid tunics with silver chain belts and powder-blue ruffled dresses. With the exception of the leather pieces, shine dominated the runway, with fabrics that shimmered with every step the models took. These were not clothes for the faint of heart.</p></div>"
84,spring,2000,s2000,robert-cary-williams,"Imagine an off-blue, tailored leather pantsuit. Then imagine its collars held together with a knifelike slice of mirrored glass, and you can see why Robert Cary-Williams' third runway show held everyone's attention. A young designer who has previously shown on runways banging with explosions, Cary-Williams stayed true to his inspirations—molded leather that he bakes in an oven and deconstructed tailoring. Jackets were crafted in butter-colored or cloud gray leather with detailed topstitching and seaming, while dresses were trimmed with leather or zips. Trousers were beautifully deconstructed to fall away into skirts and many jackets were completely backless. If Cary-Williams couldn't resist a few art school moments, like a dress made entirely of mirrors, the star piece—an organza dress decorated with zips that unraveled down Kate Moss' bared back—proved this designer has a unique vision that should be watched.</p></div>"
85,spring,2000,s2000,ruffo-research,"A.F. Vandervoorst took over the reigns at Ruffo Research this year from Raf Simons and Veronique Branquinho, who had imbued the traditional leather goods company with a more experimental edge. The transition couldn't have been smoother: A.F. Vandervoorst’s collection was brave, innovative and brilliant, reworking traditional biker and hospital uniforms into luxurious leather ensembles, some with unexpected details like asymmetrical closures and sleeves, others strikingly simple and clean. Ruffo Research provided a very welcome jolt of inspiration to Milan fashion week; some of their pieces, like the white, paper-thin hospital lab coats, distressed trousers and heavily pleated skirts, are sure to become instant cult classics with the forward-thinking set.</p></div>"
86,spring,2000,s2000,saint-laurent,"""Yves Saint Laurent is not about the past and it's not about the future. It is eminently contemporary,"" said Pierre Bergé before the show began. Truer words could not have been spoken. Alber Elbaz created a collection that perfectly captures the fashion moment ""designed for a woman who desires traditions with a twist, who thinks big and lives fast."" Classic Saint Laurent favorites looked better than ever--tuxedo suits with chiffon shirts, evening dresses brimming with flou français and sexy tops with oversized cowl necks. But there were also sharp new pieces, like a series of semitransparent green, fuchsia, blue and plum suits; hard-edged tan leather dresses; plastic paillette gowns; python overcoats and Amazon-inspired silk shirts with leaf motifs. Clearly, Saint Laurent's strong, gutsy woman is still very much in vogue—and, thankfully, it looks like we'll be seeing plenty of her in the future.</p></div>"
87,spring,2000,s2000,sonia-rykiel,"A flowing, sensual silhouette accented with occasional hard touches has been a recurring motif through Sonia Rykiel's impressive career. This season she geared her collection toward the ""tough, unpredictable, and determined woman."" Rykiel produced a series of flouncy, delicate dresses spiced up with pleats, square necks and lace detailing. The clothes were at times sweet and delicate, but often provocatively sexy, such as the series of rhinestone sweaters, brightly colored rabbit fur bomber jackets and ""crocheted dresses for eccentric ladies"" she showed. Even Rykiel's bride had an edge: Her flowing white gown, like many pieces in the show, was trimmed with metal studs. What about Rykiel's wedding-night accessories? A blue bouquet and tons of attitude, <em>bien sûr</em>.</p></div>"
88,spring,2000,s2000,sportmax,"Sportmax designs simple, easy-to-wear clothes for people who want the look of the moment without taking too many fashion risks. This season revolved around a beach motif, featuring shorts, customized tank tops and sexy bikinis decorated with petals. Simple T-shirts received a glamour boost with paillette detailing, and a Pucci-like print showed up on liquid chiffon skirts and handkerchief shirts. The ""modern nomad"" looks were accessorized with '80s-style sunglasses and gigantic bags—big enough to carry your beach supplies, or your all-important traveling essentials.</p></div>"
89,spring,2000,s2000,strenesse,"Gabrielle Strehle designed for Strenesse a concise line of blouson shirts, off-the-shoulder tops, and slinky dresses in solid shades of white, aqua, gold and tan. The general feeling was reminiscent of California in the '70s, but the final effect was thoroughly contemporary. Soft suede, denim twill and baby cashmere gave the collection an atmosphere of luxury that stemmed from precision of design and refinement of materials rather than overt decoration. Smart details like subtle beading on gold skirts, thin belt straps and ruched necklines packed quite a punch, but were never overdone.</p></div>"
90,spring,2000,s2000,susan-lazar,"Susan Lazar—who's known for creating clean, modern styles—presented a collection of youthful classics at The Altman in Chelsea. The simple, easy-to-wear separates showcased several of the season's prevailing trends, including white canvas coats worn over long silk skirts in shades of olive and rust, camisole dresses in desert rose and canary yellow, and tops and skirts with a decorative touch of Moroccan embroidery.</p></div>"
91,spring,2000,s2000,thimister,"Josephus Thimister's work is striking for its simplicity. Few designers today have the talent—or the desire—to reconfigure traditional notions of acceptable dressing, mix rich materials with pedestrian ones to create hard, striking pieces, and then use them to propose an aesthetic that's undeniably beautiful. Thimister's austere collection featured simple white trenches, dresses and skirts, many with burnt hems; there were rich knit sweaters in brown and aqua, crinkly leather ensembles and shiny black suits. But perhaps most important of all, there was no unnecessary ornamentation—just well-constructed, defiantly modern clothes based on strong creative power. And one good idea is worth more than a thousand misplaced paillettes.</p></div>"
92,spring,2000,s2000,tommy-hilfiger,"Tommy Hilfiger appropriated the current elements of decoration in fashion—beading, assorted prints, and embroidery—stripped them of all frilliness, and used them to rock the house at Madison Square Garden. Bush performed live as a parade of sexy modern-day cowboys and girls took to the runway wearing multi colored eagle bustiers, crimson motorcycle jackets, and jeans with snakeskin appliques. Red, white, and blue was the patriotic, and predominant, color scheme, occasionally tempered by patchwork dresses and floral-printed western looks. Cowboy boots inspired by the American flag added the ideal footnote to Hilfiger's extravagant looks.</p></div>"
93,spring,2000,s2000,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber's talent is with tailoring, particularly in leather and this season this young Saint Martin's graduate delivered an extremely creative and beautiful take on his signature look of seamed leather. Using the veins of a butterly wing as inspiration for his seaming, Webber joined the palest blue leather with chiffons or high-tech knits to create some unbelievably sharp tailoring. There were some to-die-for jackets and coats whose tailoring techniques were as sensous and curvacious as the female body. Webber is a truly original tailor who has to be congratulated for pioneering unique and new techniques that will undoubtedly influence the rest of the fashion world. Pale blue chiffon skirts and dresses, skin tight or looser and printed with flesh-pink 'veins' were wonderfully pretty and feminine. Webber has developed his obsession with the fusion of human anatomy and the anatomy of tailoring to create something less macabre than in previous seasons—in fact, you could call it as elegant as it was edgy.</p></div>"
94,spring,2000,s2000,tse,"Conceptual designer Hussein Chalayan showed a collection of luxurious separates for TSE on Friday afternoon. Based on the idea of ""Shadows,"" Chalayan featured multitone embroidered cotton jackets, dresses and skirts, as well as ultrasoft red cashmere sweaters. Muted color blocks showed up against backdrops of rose ash, marmalade and grey in both tops and skirts. Double-face silk dresses completed the smart, understated presentation.</p></div>"
95,spring,2000,s2000,tuleh,"The design team of Josh Patner and Brian Brantley, better known as Tuleh, showed a perfectly honed collection today. The look was sophisticated, natural and very, very pretty. Floral prints, checks and frou-frou detailing appeared on everything from body-hugging suits to flowing gowns and '50s inspired skirts. Foxy feathered skirts and strapless A-line dresses looked fresh and clean, and were perfectly complemented by the boldly-colored satin pumps that Christian Louboutin designed for Patner and Brantley. Tuleh perfectly captured the season's lust for feminine decoration without ever reverting to artifice or excess.</p></div>"
96,spring,2000,s2000,ungaro-couture,"""Love to love you, baby"" was the soundtrack for most of Ungaro's wildly extravagant ode to the late '70s and early '80s, and it couldn't have been more appropriate. The runway felt like a flashback to Studio 54—glamour girls dancing and slithering onstage in ruffled one-shoulder crepe dresses, airy georgette polka-dot tops and animal-print jerseys in acid colors. Not to mention the parade of nearly fluorescent fuchsia, orange and green disco slips, jungle motifs and extravagantly beaded ensembles. It was a rich, indulgent presentation that felt curiously appropriate in a season that has been continuously hinting at the pleasures of excess. One couldn't help but scan the audience for a sighting of Ivana Trump, and what a thrill to find her seated in the front row! There's no doubt about it—at Ungaro, flash is back, flash is good and flash is cool.</p></div>"
97,spring,2000,s2000,valentino,"Elegant, glamorous and gracefully cut are keywords when speaking of Valentino's work. This season the emphasis was on prints—floral appliqués, ivory polka dots on red crepe and lily of the valley embroideries. There were also some strong, less decorated pieces, like the stunning cashmere coat that opened the show, evocative of Jackie O. Also striking were his accessories: rectangular bags with cascades of beads and spindly high heels decorated with delicate, dainty rosebuds and glittering flowers.</p></div>"
98,spring,2000,s2000,vera-wang,"Vera Wang began her show with pure, modern dresses in white, accented with graphic, geometric patches of silver beading. A series of fluid black pieces followed, and then a procession of beaded pants and skirts, transparent tops and sequined gowns in pastel shades inundated the runway. For the conclusion, Wang offered the expected array of signature wedding gown—an ultraromantic array of dresses punctuated by flowing cathedral-length veils that trailed to the floor.</p></div>"
99,spring,2000,s2000,versace,"Versace's requisite ingredients were all present: sex, bright colors and rock-hard attitude. The volume on the runway was cranked up to 11 as an assortment of Hawaiian prints (not your traditional beach shirts, mind you), Grecian-front slinky dresses, mischievous handkerchief blouses and draped evening gowns flashed by under the strobe lights. Cleavages were deeper than ever, and a jet-set look imbued everything from the strappy bathing suits to the glittery heels and tie-collar blouses. Versace's daring cut, wild use of color and uncensored drama continue to be the label's strongest assets—and Donatella shows no signs of slowing down.</p></div>"
100,spring,2000,s2000,versus-versace,"The mood at the Versus show, which was set to the heart-pounding beats of electronic band Les Rythmes Digitales, was as sexy and extroverted as ever, with celebrities like Madonna, Rupert Everett, and Natasha Richardson seated front row center at the sleek ruby-red runway. White was the dominant color of the collection, accented with quick flashes of pink, gold, lime green, and Caribbean-colored floral prints. Slim, straight-leg trousers and short skirts were shown with slinky honeycomb tops and copper-zip jackets. Delicate embroidery, overlapping layers, lavish beading, and high-heeled boots complemented Donatella Versace's ultra-sexy silhouette.</p></div>"
101,spring,2000,s2000,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro showed a sexy, elegant collection of styles that would look right at home in the Concorde Lounge at Charles de Gaulle. Supple, deep-brown leather skirts, capri pants and skimpy shorts opened the show, followed by aqua shirt-dresses with plunging necklines. Sand-colored, cashmere-knit hot pants were worn under a cotton trench, and simple, creamy leather pants looked great with slinky embroidered tops. For evening, Alfaro featured lilac chiffon skirts, embroidered silk knit tops and crystal beaded dresses.</p></div>"
102,spring,2000,s2000,vivienne-tam,"Hong Kong designer Vivienne Tam's Spring 2000 collection was inspired by dragons, which showed up everywhere from discreet details on waistbands to large sequined representations on dresses. ""I wanted to propose a return to femininity for the twenty-first century,"" explains Tam. Her trademark embroideries were applied to technologically-advanced, iridescent fabrics in hues like ivory, jade and coral. Minimalist jackets were lavishly draped, printed dresses were generously beaded and skirts were dip-dyed in aqua and mint green. Tam designed the kind of wardrobe that will take a chic, young girl-about-town from mother's garden party to the nightclub without skipping a beat.</p></div>"
103,spring,2000,s2000,yohji-yamamoto,"Deconstructing (and then reconfiguring) traditional clothing and silhouettes has always been an essential component of Yamamoto's work, and this season he addressed the issue head-on. A simple white dress opened his show; a virtually identical one, adorned only by a black ruffle on the front followed it; next, it developed a sleeve and side section. Eventually, of course, the outfit was completed with two sleeves and shoulders, though Yamamoto never quite got around to the back. The effect was stunning, as were the beige full skirts with elaborate pleats and voluminous ruffles, feather umbrellas, trench coats and preciously embroidered tops in the lightest possible shades of orange, purple and green. It takes a master of nuance to pull off such a delicate collection—and Yamamoto did it faultlessly.</p></div>"
1,fall,2000,f2000,alberta-ferretti,"Come fall, Alberta Ferretti's girls will be casually strolling up Madison Avenue, sipping cocktails at the Plaza and then heading out for a night on the town. Ferretti showed a full wardrobe of essentials for the quintessential girl-about-town: Wool coats with fur-trimmed sleeves, sheared fur jackets and beaded, layered evening dresses all looked chic. There were also optical-printed tops, croc skirts and tweed suits cinched at the waist with thick metallic bands. The overall effect depended on which shoes the girls wore—Ferretti offered both slim, ladylike heels and perfectly flat riding boots.</p></div>"
2,fall,2000,f2000,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua's presentation kicked off with Alek Wek wearing a simple yet stunning black jersey dress with a flower appliqué on the side. This marked the beginning of a collection filled with similar motifs—floral and butterfly embellishments showed up on bodysuits, sexy skirts and sheer overlay dresses. Op-printed sweaters and skirts, short furs and translucent tops with ruffled trims also took a turn on the runway. The show closed with a string of jean ensembles that contrasted the streetwise appeal of denim with the romantic feel of breezy chiffon tops.</p></div>"
3,fall,2000,f2000,alexander-mcqueen,"Björk took a fancy to, and was photographed in, a dramatic, deconstructed acid-wash denim hoop dress from this collection. Named for Eshu, the Yoruba spirit, the show paired African influences (neck rings) with Victoriana (leg-of-mutton sleeves) to dramatic effect.</p></div>"
4,fall,2000,f2000,ann-demeulemeester,"It was full speed ahead for Ann Demeulemeester, who successfully revitalized her signature designs while staying true to her well-known style. The mood was decidedly urban and gritty: There were blasted black leather coats with asymmetric skirts, stressed orange suede jackets, aged wool coats and washed black-denim ensembles. Demeulemeester's usually stark color scheme of black and white was livened up by purple military-inspired overcoats, lime-green papery tops, floor-sweeping orange skirts and a glorious sleeveless fur wrap with unfinished edges. Sequined tops, fur mufflers and yellow knit wraps gave a fun, luxurious edge to the great-looking collection.</p></div>"
5,fall,2000,f2000,anna-sui,"Bohemian deluxe is the leitmotif of Sui's work, and this season was no exception. Her runway resembled a luxurious recasting of an outdoor concert circa 1974: There were assorted floral dresses worn over colored stockings, riotous contrasts of patterns, patchwork skirts, graphic sweaters and studded jeans. Chunky stone necklaces and earrings were the perfect accessories. For evening, Sui offered embroidered georgette blouses, fringed skirts in black and pink, Lurex-striped dresses and sequined mesh tops.</p></div>"
6,fall,2000,f2000,arkadius,"The first outfit was a tiny minidress with a metallic lace top that covered the model's face. Her hand was linked to her feet with miles of gold chains—she did a good job making it to the end of the runway in all that armor. Outfit No. 2 was another miniscule dress with a giant hood decorated with porcupine quills. You get the picture. Polish-born Arkadius, in his second season, makes mad, mad clothes—the kind you come to London to see. Along with the arty insanity there were some fabulous ideas such as the foam dress, which made its wearer look as though she were an elegant mushroom; and the sweater with foam arms, which created the weird impression that the model had four arms. On a more practical note, Arkadius had one heavenly cream coat that combined wool and fur. Fur as fabric is the trendiest texture for next season. You saw it here first.</p></div>"
7,fall,2000,f2000,badgley-mischka,"Models coolly walked down a runway made out of snow at Badgley Mischka, with ice totems looming in the background. The reference was clear: Lights reflected the multicolored hues in the sculptures and on the floor as much as on the designer's dazzling clothing. This season, the collection consisted mostly of solid looks in beige, black and white—double-face cashmere was paired with sequined trousers and beaded georgette; rabbit bombers were worn with leather jeans. The ultra-glamorous eveningwear consisted of embroidered patchwork gowns and sequined sheaths in bronze, champagne, and magnesium; the bronze was so sequined it looked nearly holographic.</p></div>"
8,fall,2000,f2000,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière showed one of the most original, refined collections of the season for Balenciaga.</p><p>At a moment when artless reinterpretations of the past seem to dominate the runways, his clothes stood out for their distinct originality. To be sure, there were strong '80s references, like sharp shoulders, punk-inspired fastenings on jackets and pegged baggy trousers; but the looks were constructed with a freshness that had nothing to do with the past.</p><p>While straight, narrow black pants were worn with strict jackets and zippered shirts, ragged, tattered dresses were wrapped around the body to look nonchalantly chic. Tailored jeans were the perfect companions for batwing turtlenecks, tapestry tiger-print vests and elaborately ruffled tops. The quiet color scheme—centered on black, navy, rust and tan—added an element of sobriety and elegance to the clothes. In all, it was an extraordinary presentation—one that is sure to put Balenciaga once and for all in the center of the fashion map.</p></div>"
9,fall,2000,f2000,balmain,"At Balmain, Gilles Dufour takes the house's staid <em>Jolie Madame</em> image and filters it through the eyes of a younger generation. There is a limit to how rebellious his gilded <em>Parisienne</em> wants to get, however. <em>Grandmère's</em> draped black-jersey cocktail dress from the '40s? Punk it up a little with colored hose and spike-heeled satin ankle boots. <em>Maman's</em> sun-ray-pleated, giant-dot print '60s chiffon frock? Shrug a slim leather coat over it, and pin your hair into a messy French twist. Those dappled double-face country tweeds (nip-waist jackets and short, full skirts)? Spice them up with a graffiti print T-shirt or a skinny cashmere sweater with a saucy message emblazoned across the front.</p><p>Dufour takes an old leaf from Schiaparelli's book too, sprinkling beaded butterflies, satin M&amp;Ms or coils of ""pasta"" on fitted evening jackets, or sequin eyes, lips and even bright-colored false nails on knits. Flying with the season's ""more is more"" mantra, and leaving the editing to the editors, Dufour throws little mink matinee jackets (reinvented in cartoon colors and shrugged over cut-velvet and chiffon kilts), firework embroideries and Dickensian cutaway jackets into the frantic mix.</p></div>"
10,fall,2000,f2000,bcbg-max-azria,"According to designer Max Azria, Wim Wenders' 1987 film <em>Wings of Desire</em> was the inspiration for BCBG this season. Literal interpretations included wing motifs on the backs of heather-gray wool jackets and black T-shirts. There were also more subtle references like embroidered chiffon tops with ties that fell to the floor, mud-fur jackets, and a color palette that revolved around pewter, porcelain and sable. Colorful pieces included shiny croclike coats, glitter suede jackets, and easy plaid coats and pants. Accessories were fun and playful: faux-mink wraps, fake-fur and feather-covered bags and tall boots in distressed metallic leather.</p></div>"
11,fall,2000,f2000,bella-freud,"Bella Freud never does anything obvious—so of course her show wasn't a show at all. Instead, the designer decided to produce her own magazine, shot over the course of two days. Anita Pallenberg lent her very bohemian Chelsea flat for the shoot, which was only fitting since the whole collection was inspired by her personal style and the movie <em>Performance.</em> ""Anita's always dressed much cooler than the average rock and roller,"" said Freud. ""She has some really tacky things and some really elegant things."" Freud's collection pairs an orange velvet suit with a lilac polka-dot chiffon blouse; a purple leopard-print stretch dress with a classic coat; and a pinstripe suit with a striped English school scarf. There were perfect little black satin dresses with frills at the elbow; mini minidresses in green tiger-print chiffon and tiny skirts in fabulous English tweed. And for anyone who can't wear a 3-inch skirt, there are masses of sexy, beautifully produced knitwear.</p><p>Freud's magazine will feature all of London's coolest kids: Photographer Dan Macmillan, who will also take a turn in front of the camera, and Chanel girl Devon Aoki, Jerry Hall, Jade Parfitt and Kiara as models. Add a John Malkovich interview with Pallenberg and a contribution from artist Sarah Lucas and you have the ultimate fashion 'zine. There's only one hitch: As yet the magazine has no title.</p></div>"
12,fall,2000,f2000,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson is one designer who consistently puts fun in fashion, and she never disappoints. Manhattan's Lot 61 was converted into a nightclub for her presentation—complete with strobe lights, disco balls, blaring music and scantily clad rock chicks, motorcycle vixens and disco bunnies. Looks included plasticized cat suits, hot-pink biker ensembles, micro shorts with zipper sides, Lurex ""Ziggy Stardust"" minidresses, technicolor lizard-print hipsters and provocative eyelet leather pants. For the finale, Johnson showed mini-tutus in neon colors paired with lace tees, bras and halter tops; her wedding gown consisted of a lace puff top with diamond mini-pouf skirt.</p></div>"
13,fall,2000,f2000,bottega-veneta,"“Irresistible Bitch” was the soundtrack at Bottega Veneta, summing up the unabashedly rich, attitude-drenched spirit of the collection. Head-to-toe ski chalet outfits—picture a Bond girl on vacation in Cortina d’Ampezzo—included tan napa jackets and skirts, angora neck cuffs, knee-high boots and matching oversized bags. The ’70s-inspired feeling of irrepressible luxury also extended to several sexy silk-denim looks, as well as plush sheepskin coats, woven leather tops and shiny crocodile clutches and belts. Cashmere legwarmers, fingerless gloves and fuzzy angora short shorts completed the look.</p></div>"
14,fall,2000,f2000,boudicca,"Talented young designers Boudicca don't play by any rules except their own. Boudicca are less interested in creating clothes to wear than in ideas—but that's exactly what we come to London to see. So here are a few ideas, fresh from the Boudicca runway. A striped organza blouse that billowed out at the waist in wonderfully extravagant folds was bound in with a huge white sash. Then there was the precious cut shirt, a little puffed at the shoulder, whose sleeves split down the side of each arm and were starched to within an inch of their lives. The leather coats with weird flaps at front and neck weren't exactly deconstruction nor reconstruction. London fashion sometimes defies description, but that's the fun of it.</p></div>"
15,fall,2000,f2000,bruce,"Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, known as Bruce, proved once again that they are one of the most talented design teams in New York. This season, they presented their clothing on mannequins, with guests ambling by as if attending an art show (which very well could have been the case). Experimenting with elaborate draping and cutting techniques, the duo showed striking nubby knits, dresses decorated with scarves and gold chains, a gray leather skirt with a gathered front and a stunning leather vest with ruffled edges. Bruce's trademark has always been individuality, and it is easy to understand why—their nuanced, lovingly made clothes reflect a maturity and commitment to the integrity of their work that is seldom seen.</p></div>"
16,fall,2000,f2000,burberry-prorsum,"After a somewhat unsure beginning at Burberry, designer Roberto Menichetti has finally found his voice this season. Burberry showed 12 looks in a very strong, slick presentation at their redesigned Haymarket store—looks that said Burberry and England as much as they said modern and urban.</p><p>Menichetti's inspiration is the biker's uniform—a super-sophisticated, luxury leather and cashmere version. His message is that we should all wear very thin layers next season, each one as chic as the next, so that we can feel comfortable whether we are in an air-conditioned office or in snow boots. There were skinny leather pants in tawny brown worn with a feather-light hot-pink cashmere sweater, over which was layered a fuchsia leather jacket and a faded Burberry-check coat. And kilts in a hot-pink version of the Burberry check, wrapped and pinned in an ingenious fashion, worn with layers of fine cashmere and cool biker-inspired jackets.</p><p>The most interesting fabric development was the ultralight shearling coat—it was almost as weightless as one of his cashmere cardigans. But the crowning glory of this collection has to be the reinvention of the famous Burberry check once again. This time it was injected with a raspberry hue—the fringed scarf is a must-have.</p></div>"
17,fall,2000,f2000,calvin-klein-collection,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee Calvin Klein's main strength lies in understanding what modern women want to wear, and providing it effortlessly. Always in tune with the fashion zeitgeist, Klein turned his attention to polished silhouettes and timeless classics, redone in luxurious fabrics and deep colors. Sporty 3/4-length trousers and cashmere tweed suits shared the runway with shiny alligator coats and metallic leather skirts; floor-sweeping coats made a powerful statement, as did the sheer satin dresses in inky hues. For evening, there were satin slips in aubergine, gunmetal, powder and ruby, as well as papery graphite ensembles and viscose jersey dresses. It was a controlled, sensible collection that encapsulated the feminine, ladylike mood of the moment.</p></div>"
18,fall,2000,f2000,carolina-herrera,"It was back to basic chic for Carolina Herrera, who focused on her traditional, well-known feminine and no-nonsense silhouette. Her collection revolved around suits—formfitting stretch wool and bouclé jackets were paired with flared or lean skirts and skinny, tailored pants. Black prevailed for both day and evening. Leather skirts and coats looked striking and modern when paired with sand georgette tops, and simple crepe gowns made a splash with shocks of pink and scarlet. There was also a lush chevron-striped mink jacket, and richly embroidered dresses and separates that exuded Herrera's unmistakable touch of classic sophistication.</p></div>"
19,fall,2000,f2000,celine,"To the rousing chords of the theme music from <em>Dynasty</em>, Michael Kors took Celine on a playful romp through the high-excess '80s. It was a case of ""move-over-Nolan-Miller"" as Kors paid tribute to the campy deluxe looks once worn by Alexis Carrington and her rivals. You want luxury Dallas-style? Kors has it in spades. That black-and-gold-brocade Anna Karenina jacket? How about adding sable cuffs, collar and center banding? And why not swag golden chains as fastenings across it too. A chocolate Persian midi coat? Hem it with deep bands of cocoa mink. That black Swarovski-beaded shirt? Why not wear it with a leopard-beaded and ostrich-hemmed skirt.</p><p>Kors claimed Oscar nominee Chloë Sevigny as his primary inspiration. Although Sevigny is barely old enough to have experienced the decade firsthand, she has an insouciant way with great clothes of recent vintage—like '70s Saint Laurent pieces—that place her ahead of the fashion curve. Kors revisited the Saint Laurent ideal via off-the-shoulder satin print gypsy dresses in café au lait, paisley or leopard-print satin. Bold Chanel overscale tweed weaves also put in an appearance.</p><p>Kors is obviously targeting the glamorous young Park Avenue princesses who want to play dress-up in clothes they (just) remember their moms wearing. And who knows—Mom herself might be tempted to relive the glory moment too.</p></div>"
20,fall,2000,f2000,cerruti,"Peter Speliopoulos takes the Milanese route for Cerruti, with a collection that provides an elegant, low-key spin on the trends du jour.</p><p>Thus, neat Duchess of Windsor coats with the look of Julianne Moore's '40s costumes in <em>The End of the Affair</em> are interpreted in subtly beautiful Cerruti fabrics—like a black wool flecked with ruby glitter, or a pepper-and-salt tweed that catches a bordeaux-colored shadow in movement. The retro ladylike look follows through to the longer skirts with a graceful swing to them, and to the accessories, which included those all-too-familiar open-toed '40s sandals (shown with old-fashioned back-seamed stockings) and tiny fur tippets at the neck, already featured at Prada. Other quiet takes on trend items that Speliopoulos features include a herringbone black-and-white mink trench; chiffon bib blouses; the batwing sweater (with a deep bateau neck, and a fine gauge turtleneck worn underneath) and spiky feather fronding on café au lait and prune chiffons.</p></div>"
21,fall,2000,f2000,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan set his stage up like a sitting room. Very spare, it consisted of four chairs, a table, a flat screen television, several vases and pots, and lots and lots of white space. What has all this to do with clothes? In Chalayan's world, everything. Chalayan's models appeared dressed in seemingly simple clothes like a black coat, or tan trench, and then secreted away the household objects inside the coats or in outer pockets. Like millennial (and amazingly chic) nomads, they wandered the stage in stiff black dresses inspired by Christian Dior, ruffled skirts, shirts with strange volumes, all of it perfectly proportioned, very new and outrageously modern.</p><p>Chalayan's finale was quite astonishing. Four models clad in chic gray shift-dresses approached the set of chairs, removed the covers and literally put them on. The chair covers became perfect versions of the shifts they were already wearing. The last model stepped inside the table, lifted it up, and it transformed into a wooden skirt (the real fashion-insider will remember Chalayan's graduation show included a wooden skirt too). Finally, the chairs folded into suitcases, which were carried off the stage; the television screen disappeared; and we were left looking at an empty room. If it sounds like magic, that’s because it was.</p></div>"
22,fall,2000,f2000,chanel,"<em>On the anniversary of Karl Lagerfeld’s death, we look back at his fall 2000 collection for Chanel, presented in Paris in March 2000.</em></p><p>A year after Karl Lagerfeld’s death, we’ve gone back into the archives to retrieve the designer’s first-rate Fall 2000 collection, shown 20 years ago in Paris. The set wasn’t over-the-top elaborate, and the front row was more socialite- than celebrity-heavy (though Julianne Moore, Carole Bouquet, and Isabella Blow were in attendance), which threw the clothes into the spotlight where they belonged. Not that they were showy—they weren’t—but because they were keepers and oh-so-Chanel.</p><p>Fall 2000 was, overall, the season of the lady. One who had polish—and, likely, two homes and one eye on the fluctuating stock market. “With the Dow Jones and Nasdaq soaring and plunging like a late-sixties hemline,” wrote Sally Singer in <em>Vogue,</em> “it was perhaps inevitable that many designers would choose for fall 2000 to forgo fantasy and get back to basics—luxe basics, that is.” At Chanel that meant cardigan suits and LBDs, but also denim and active ski gear (this was before global warming made snow a real rarity).</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""t22nt5""></div></div><p>Lagerfeld was, in fact, much more easygoing about the bougie vibe than many other designers were. He always delighted in subversion, whether of the house codes or the play of opposites, be that high/low or some other unexpected pairing. Look 42, a softly pleated pastel green chiffon shirt with softly inflated shoulders worn with a logo scarf and leather-topped jeans, hit just the right balance.</p><p>Upending Chanelisms was not Lagerfeld’s goal for Fall 2000, but he worked with the building blocks (as opposed to basics) with which Coco Chanel built a wardrobe for active women while adding his own touches, like whisper-light pleated skirts or midi-length ones of quilted down. (The double-C tights deserve mention too.) Asked to elaborate on his inspiration, Lagerfeld said he had been looking at and thinking about “early ready-to-wear, the end of couture, Courreges meeting Chanel.” More important was what he had been feeling: “It’s about the attitude of the early ’60s—my own memories of Jean Shrimpton and all the girls in those happy, easy days.”</p><p>For all of the joyous fashion moments Lagerfeld gave us over the course of his prolific career, we say thank you.</p></div>"
23,fall,2000,f2000,chloe,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee for her Chloé collection, Stella McCartney drew inspiration from her own childhood memories of the '70s and '80s. And since the self-proclaimed ""Rock Princess'"" impressionable years moved to a disco beat, so did this racy collection. The sexy, fun-loving Chloé gals strutted their stuff at the Opèra Garnier to the raunchiest soundtrack to rock the runways in years.</p><p>Stella set the tone for the collection with short, batwing-sleeved jersey disco dresses, trellised with Art Deco beading—all set for Studio 54. Inspired by the allure of a girl shrugging her ""boyfriend's secondhand coat"" over a skimpy dress, Stella provided wintry cover-up in off-white ""Afghan lamb"" fake fur.""Deco"" seen through '70s eyes—hink Biba, that pacy fashion and style emporium—appeared in ombré-shaded lozenge prints and in silky jersey pieces, as well as in the crisply tailored wool coats that have become a Stella signature. There was more '20s influence in the Josephine Baker-style clasps, threaded with lengths of silk ribbon cord that belted satin tops or hipsters, and in the lush beaded trim on hot chocolate, jade green and navy.</p><p>Quirky, too, were the deluxe knitting bags, transformed from the prosaic via dense beading of hand-cut feather-shaped sequins. This embroidery later appeared fringing the sleeves of mini shifts—and as entrance-making jackets and coats—like ""plastic fake fur,"" enthused Sean Lennon, who joined Stella's ever-supportive dad Paul McCartney in the audience.</p></div>"
24,fall,2000,f2000,christian-dior,"""Welcome to all our Super Fly Girls,"" read the models' upbeat cue-card backstage at the House of Dior's latest extravaganza. After the furor over his last Dior ""hobo"" couture collection, designer John Galliano crowded the mirrored runway with throwaway luxe outfits that took a leaf—make that a volume or two—from the opulent style manuals of the contemporary rap world. The fur was flying: Chunky sable and chinchilla coats, and even a sheared mink trench, were shrugged over barely there boudoir chiffon dresses (some suspended from thick gold chains). Even Galliano's thick knits were threaded with fur strips (and worn with '80s ostrich-skin skirts or skinny pants). When the fur wasn't real, it was printed--think faded animal spots on chiffon or beaded leopard pelts on stonewashed denim. <em>The Christian Dior Daily,</em> a newspaper created just for the show, was printed on chiffon, leather and even the reverse side of furs.</p><p>The mood softened with perversely ragged dresses inspired by Galliano's couture collection, and a finale of miraculously cut black or lingerie-pink lace and chiffon dresses. These, with their deconstructed corset pieces cleverly built-in, and with sun-ray-pleat insets fanning into trains, hinted at the refined Galliano magic of yesteryear.</p></div>"
25,fall,2000,f2000,christian-lacroix,"It was a playful ""Send in the Clowns"" message from Christian Lacroix, who presented his collection in the sawdust ring of a delightful early-19th-century circus. His setting, which included a towering tree of lightbulb garlands, had a certain whimsical charm, one that Lacroix apparently wanted to capture in the clothes.</p><p>True to his egalitarian philosophy, Lacroix deconstructed his various lines, mixing Jeans and Bazar pieces with his collection items. Thus, the show opened with his skinny-leg jeans—no ordinary jeans in this fashion genie's hands, of course—given the full couture works, either densely studded with gold and silver rivets or embellished with random artsy patches of bright-colored mink. With his slim pant, Lacroix showed garishly hued boxy mink jackets or tucked and pleated Victorian blouses, all with a high-rise shoulder line.</p><p>Then his clothes got really elaborate. In an eye-boggling palette of shrill neons and brights, foiled with black and white, Lacroix's multi-media pieces were a riot of appliqués, embroideries, color-block prints and patchworks. In their febrile eccentricity, they seemed to owe a debt to the performance art clothing of the late Leigh Bowery, star of the '80s London club scene. While exhilarating at times, Lacroix's ceaselessly inventive touches could prove exhausting at others; his profligate way with the ingredients made some of the dishes indigestible.</p></div>"
26,fall,2000,f2000,clements-ribeiro,"Even under the worldwide onslaught of Super-Chic Chic, Clements Ribeiro prefer to go their own, super-decorated way. Good for them—I like designers who stay true to themselves. That is not to say that Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro don't have their own, very quirky little brand of chic going. They do. It consists of soft chiffon dresses beaded with tarnished siver sequins, little sweater sets in glittery stripes or polka dots, distressed tartan skirt suits, beautifully printed silk blouses with wonderfully billowy '70s-style sleeves, and wool coats printed with giant, glittery polka dots. Their take on the suit was as original as ever—a cropped jacket with puffy sleeves and cropped trousers, or a bow-necked jacket with a slim skirt.</p><p>Clements Ribeiro's use of color is always interesting, and this time the hit combination was lemon and camel. Worn as a sharp little camel coat with lemon dress and hat, this look was the very picture of chic, London-style.</p></div>"
27,fall,2000,f2000,comme-des-garcons,"As a follow-up to a frilly feminine Spring 2000 show, Rei Kawakubo presented a collection titled Hard and Forceful for the Fall. A paean to punk, it featured tartan (of course), bondage-style straps, black leather, and studs. Sound straightforward? Think again. A plaid jacket paired with a full tulle skirt had a New Look air; the Royal Stewart plaid was twisted into cascades of flowering ruffles.</p><p>The collection was shown on models with close-cropped, bobby-pinned wings and Cubist beauty looks. It closed with a punchy graphic print, featuring lips, eyes, flowers, and razor blades drawn in red and black on a white ground.

28,fall,2000,f2000,costume-national,"Costume National is best known for its sleek, modern take on urban ready-to-wear. The label's loyal following of no-nonsense, minimal-inclined clients will have no trouble revamping their fall wardrobes with supple leather tops, slim pantsuits and satin copper blouses. To lighten the mood, they will turn to off-white suede jackets worn with leather skirts (skin on skin is an unbeatable combination), and cowl-neck sweaters. Of course, everyone needs a bit of spice once in a while. Not to worry—houndstooth-print red-and-black satin dresses, sheared fur sweaters and glittery black suits for evening should do the trick.</p></div>"
29,fall,2000,f2000,cynthia-rowley,"It was a fun, fast-paced show at Cynthia Rowley, based on the lives of young, rich and beautiful It girls. Soft, feminine prints acquired a hard edge when cut close to the body and paired with beaded mock-croc tops. Short dresses in optical prints screamed for a night of dancing, while striped leather pants and chiffon tops looked urban and easy-to-wear. A series of brocaded, glittery evening looks provided yet another set of wardrobe options for those hankering for a night out on the town.</p></div>"
30,fall,2000,f2000,daryl-k,"This season, Daryl K's recurrent themes—country-western, punk and urban hipster motifs—were fused together in a vibrant, eclectic cocktail. The show consisted of 30 carefully constructed looks that included silk-pleated bomber jackets with insets, shearling jackets and jean skirts with velvet insets. Of course, Kerrigan also featured her trademark hip-huggers, spiced up with leather piping or metallic glitter, and paired with billowy angel blouses. And, if you're in need of the perfect downtown party ensemble, look no further: Daryl K's patchwork leather dresses, tuxedo shirts and suede gathered numbers are sure to hit the spot.</p></div>"
31,fall,2000,f2000,diane-von-furstenberg,"""Feel like a woman—wear a dress"" was the inscription on the tickets attached to Diane von Furstenberg's famous wrap dresses in the early '70s. Twenty years later, the designer's philosophy of ""simple, one-step dressing"" still rings true--women need elegant outfits that work in virtually any situation, day or night. This time around, von Furstenberg presented her collection in the form of a <em>tableau vivant</em>, with models casually chatting and dancing to the music as guests ambled by. Silk jersey dresses in harlequin prints, paperweight suede numbers in brown, ivy green and pumpkin and double-faced satin sheaths in marble blue and yellow were at the heart of the collection. The silhouette was slinky, seductive and classic, with a distinctly aloof and sophisticated edge.</p></div>"
32,fall,2000,f2000,dkny,"Donna Karan's DKNY collection revolved around suits this season, featuring a structured silhouette in classic tweeds, herringbones and plaids. Belted macs, pleated skirts, cashmere turtlenecks and mohair dresses all looked grown-up and sophisticated, while sexy oxblood leather coats, sheer chiffon tops and lacquered satin shells also made a polished statement. But DKNY is all about mixing and matching—Karan also showed colorful Fair Isle cashmere and washed-wool multi-bias sweaters that were both relaxed and modern. And, naturally, there were plenty of sexy options—Karan's slim pants, short leather jackets, liquid dresses and vivid hosiery are sure to satisfy even the staunchest DKNY aficionado.</p></div>"
33,fall,2000,f2000,dolce-gabbana,"Looking for dazzle? Leave it to Dolce &amp; Gabbana to supply a jolt of show-stopping glamour. Inspired by the Middle East, the duo's collection featured everything from gold tapestry-printed dresses to silver palazzo pants to glimmering, striped Lurex T-shirts. Even their interpretation of the current suit craze was appropriately glitzy: there were purple velvet knicker-and-jacket combos and three-piece corduroy riding ensembles with rhinestone-covered berets. How to top off the look? Try a patchwork shearling coat, a colorfully decorated fur or a shiny croc jacket with leopard-print lining and matching hat. If you need still more flash, you can always go for the hoop earrings, bright tights and flower-appliquéd shoes.</p></div>"
34,fall,2000,f2000,donna-karan,"""A Woman's Voice"" was the title of Donna Karan's collection, a return to the constructed, impeccably crafted pieces that every woman needs and wants. Karan's silhouette was fitted yet easy-to-wear: Shoulders were narrow while skirts opened up to full A-lines. Black set the tone for double-face wool coats, tops and pants, but there were also some sharp tweed suits as well as occasional flashes of color: Bright red cashmere sweaters and mohair skirts, aubergine trenchcoats and violet jackets livened up the show. For evening, Karan indulged in velvet cinnamon and raspberry dresses, as well as beaded, airy sequined black and burgundy numbers that were as sexy as they were sophisticated.</p></div>"
35,fall,2000,f2000,dries-van-noten,"Beneath a floating ceiling solid with lightbulbs—4,300 in all—Dries Van Noten sent out a sweet and whimsical collection where the message was in the mix.</p><p>Van Noten worked with the season's ladylike theme but translated it through the eyes of a madcap English milady. Her charming, haphazard vision revolved around unexpected juxtapositions--a tweedy coat worn over poison-green flapper dresses (beaded with blossom-shaped sequins); a mustard funnel-neck sweater, thick enough for a British winter, with a horizontally paneled emerald velvet skirt.</p><p>Van Noten cited the influence of the Bloomsbury Group of artists and writers in twenties London, and, indeed, their off-key color sense and devil-may-care attitude to clothes saturated this artsy collection. Even when Van Noten showed an outfit as unembellished as a ribbed black polo neck with wide ""Oxford Bag"" pants, he wrapped an ivory hand-knit scarf around it—and embroidered the trailing ends with a crusting of amethyst beads. There was a '50s feel, too, in the nubbly wool coats with thick fur collars, and the buoyant gored skirts in brightly colored silk stripes or fruity velvet—a lighter reworking of Van Noten's Spanish gypsy crinolines of last season.</p></div>"
36,fall,2000,f2000,elspeth-gibson,"Naomi Campbell and Madonna have both recently been spotted on major shopping sprees at Elspeth Gibson's store on Pont Street, London. I can see why. Gibson has developed into a designer whose clothes might not be wildly innovative but are absolutely irresistible regardless. Frankly, who could say no to an aubergine-colored, paisley-print wool dress, with a bow at the neck and both wrists? Not me. I don't think I could put up much resistance to Gibson's Lurex-lace-tweed (yes, she combined all three in one fabric) skirts, or to her long tweed coats with cord pockets and detailing either. This designer wants to bring back the hat (the tweed trilby), gloves (long, tan, leather) and shoes that glitter (lilac, leather, by Jimmy Choo). Entitled ""Say Chic,"" here's a wardrobe for the cool London girl—who grew up. Oh, and the other thing that maketh woman: red lips. They'll be as important as your handbag this fall.</p></div>"
37,fall,2000,f2000,emanuel-ungaro,"With an acid-splashed black runway and Billy Idol's ""Rebel Yell"" turned up to deafening volume, Ungaro's elegant front-row ladies must have suspected that the classical couturier was having an identity crisis. Suspicions were confirmed as the first Avenue Montaigne-punk amazons pounded down the runway in rockabilly zoot jackets with second-skin red-and-black ""stonewash"" jeans, teetering on glitter-toed clear-plastic spectator heels and glowering from behind their '70s tequila-sunrise sunglasses.</p><p>With an electric palette of hot pinks, poison yellows and the season's ubiquitous purples (all combined at one point in a delirious camouflage print), Ungaro indulged in a psychedelic disco parade—complete with beaded chiffon ponchos, asymmetric handkerchief hems, bright jersey mini dresses and '70s-style rock-chick beaded pantsuits. Of course, Ungaro has many of these great references in his own archives, but the fine gold chains swagged like an admiral's decorations across a scarlet pantsuit, or forming a peek-a-boo disco top, looked like they had strayed from last season's Chloé runway.</p><p>Young-at-heart mothers hitting their mid-life crises might respond to the modern idea of deconstructing their wardrobe pieces and mixing them up again with a hip new attitude, but their fashion-forward young daughters will love the real classics--like the purple-banded black on white pinstripe pantsuit and the superb new take on Rita Hayworth's knock-'em-dead <em>Gilda</em> gown, made sexy as only Ungaro knows how in black jersey.</p></div>"
38,fall,2000,f2000,emporio-armani,"Taking his Emporio line in a more eclectic direction, Giorgio Armani ably translated both luxurious and practical looks into affordable, trend-conscious clothes. On the sumptuous side, there were rich velvet and beaded evening dresses, voluminous overcoats in pale pastels and fur-trimmed chiffon tops. But, obliging his customers' taste for easy-to-wear suits and separates, Armani also showed narrow skirts, slim trousers and an assortment of wool suits. The use of geometric patterns, floral details, beaded fringes and ethnic embroidery proved that the father of minimalism can easily maintain his signature style while infusing his designs with considerable dash.</p></div>"
39,fall,2000,f2000,eric-bergere,"""I dedicated the collection to Françoise Hardy,"" explained Eric Bergère after his quintessentially Parisian collection. ""She was the Twiggy of France#151;a writer, singer and Left Bank intellectual and an inspiration for people like Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger."" Bergère took elements of Hardy's trademark kooky '60s-style—an androgynous attitude, miniskirts worn with hip-slung belts, black leather headscarves—and morphed them with pieces drawn from the uniforms of chic European children, including pinafores, short capes, school blazer badges and the sort of stiff little A-line coats favored by the British Royal family.</p><p>The soundtrack mixed folky '60s French singers with music from <em>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</em>, and mirrored Bergère's feeling for ""a little bit of '60s and '70s, but modernized"" for his clothes, which run the gamut from elegant, to, well, kooky. Bergère cuts his stylish skinny pants just above the ankle and gives his blouses the bishop's sleeve of the season, but throws some alarming hot pants and even an '80s rah-rah skirt into the brew. A sheer chiffon blouse with a bow-tie neckline (worn with a short velvet skirt), and the low back on an otherwise cover-up velvet cocktail dress, however, hint at the stylish Saint Laurent ideal that Bergère happily continues to hold dear.</p></div>"
40,fall,2000,f2000,fendi,"This season, opulence reigned supreme on the Fendi runway. Over the past few years, Fendi has become the ultimate word in high-end luxury and this collection didn’t disappoint. Any of the optical dresses, A-line leather skirts and color-splotched furs would have been just the thing on the maiden voyage of the Concorde—of course, they all look perfectly fabulous right now. Printed chiffon dresses, patent leather jackets and tweed suits—most cinched at the waist with gaudy gold belts—added to the sumptuous mix. The all-out decadent mood was reminiscent of the eighties, several prints were inspired by the sixties and the glamorous attitude was all seventies, but the spirit of the collection was anything but retro. The irreverent mixing and matching of references, and the skillful way in which colors and fabrics were treated, was absolutely of the moment and nothing short of brilliant.</p></div>"
41,fall,2000,f2000,genny,"Josephus Thimister's graphic, fluid presentation for Genny was inspired by the Russian constructivist artists of the '20s. Centered on the idea of contrasts, Thimister alternated between rigorous tweeds, light muslin and patchworks of shimmering, ethereal fabrics. His color palette paid homage to Kandinsky, relying on hues of pale green, tangerine, magenta and peach, with occasional bursts of violet. The masterful way Thimister gathered sheer tops and layered delicate skirts evinced his couture background; the dreamy mood was offset by sharp trousers and sleek coats. Genny's collection was a tribute to the designer's ability to combine seemingly disparate elements in a sophisticated and beautiful manner.</p></div>"
42,fall,2000,f2000,gianfranco-ferre,"The extravagant craftsmanship of couture has filtered down to Gianfranco Ferré's whimsical ready-to-wear line. No less eclectic than romantic, Ferré's collection featured languid dresses, taffeta ruffles over crinolines and strict Hungarian army coats thrown over utterly feminine georgette robes. There were also long leather skirts, gray flannel trousers and the designer's signature tailored shirts. This precisely cut collection will surely keep Ferré's well-established clientele perfectly satisfied.</p></div>"
43,fall,2000,f2000,giorgio-armani,"It was a welcome treat to see Giorgio Armani do what he does best: dress sophisticated women in classic, chic clothes. The suit—Armani's forte and the season's leitmotif—played an appropriately prominent role in this collection. But forget untailored and slouchy--these suits were sharp, closely cut and sexy, in jet-black or gray. There were also cropped fur jackets with blue and lavender highlights, colorful striped tops and embroidered trousers in shades of mint green and coral. For evening, Armani indulged in a series of floor-length sophisticated black-and-white beaded gowns, which explains why he remains the darling of the international cocktail party set.</p></div>"
44,fall,2000,f2000,givenchy,"Alexander McQueen bravely set his show to the X-Ray Spec's punk ballad ""I'm a cliché?""—then set out to refute the message by appropriating styling tricks absorbed from a new school of designers. His first look—a man-size jacket in army green worn with a white shirt, narrow golden clip-on tie and a white shirt and hose—defined the new '80s proportions that are establishing themselves so forcefully this season. '80s, too, were the clever twist jersey mini dresses (think early Versace), and the gold lamé wood-grain brocades, used for sharply cut short-waisted jackets and slim-leg pants worn with sleeveless leather tops (Alexis Carrington goes clubbing). A Gothic punky attitude coursed through the show, reinforced through the somber palette of army green, black and purple.</p><p>As he reinforced with his own name-collection, McQueen is a visionary talent. So it was a pity that this production had the formulaic look of a stylist-led collection, with classic staples tricked up with styling details—like trousers bloused into ankle boots, and jackets cinched at waist or hip with invisibly fastening wide patent belts and Kraftwerk-narrow ties worn with men's shirts. Flashes of McQueen's real talents shone through in the punk-slashed tartan top over a prune patent mini, those twist dresses and a black-and-purple banded leather mini-dress, the bands fastening in back like bondage belts.</p><p>More exhilarating still was McQueen's bow—he coursed the considerable length of the runway (a beautiful curving corridor in the Musée du Cinema, currently under renovation) on a speeding scooter.</p></div>"
45,fall,2000,f2000,gucci,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year Nominee Tom Ford's collection for Gucci was sleek, sensual and filled with the edgy sex appeal that has become his trademark. The show opened with a series of sharp and shiny silk gazar dresses and coats, featuring ornately ruffled necklines. Wool and cashmere looks included belted coats with carefully defined waists and leather-trimmed tweed suits. Ford quickly moved on to fitted, in-your-face motorcycle ensembles that were thoroughly young and urban. For evening, he turned the volume way up with an assortment of dazzling gold coats, slinky dresses and beaded gowns with plunging necklines. The entire collection was carried by Ford's deft way with shapes and materials, which allowed him to effortlessly create a feeling that was modern and chic.</p></div>"
46,fall,2000,f2000,halston,"Simplicity in dressing was Halston's dictum while he was still alive. Now it seems that a less discreet philosophy has permeated practically every piece that bears his name: Gold ombré sequined suits, goatskin ball gowns and tricolor pastel tweed ensembles were a few of the looks on the runway this season. Alongside classic Halston staples like Ultrasuede raincoats and lace halter skimps, there were logo beaded dresses, cardigans and jackets. Sex appeal was a key element of the show, and a lot of the eveningwear, like the matte jersey slit dresses, fox wraps and slick columns, are sure never to go unnoticed.</p></div>"
47,fall,2000,f2000,helmut-lang,"Urban and modern are synonymous with Helmut Lang, and with good reason. This season, while most designers scamper to redefine yet another bygone era or perfectly distill the trend of the moment, Lang took time out to create sharp, clean and timeless clothes. That is not to say that there were no references involved; Balenciaga certainly was an influence for the fitted tops and jackets, bell-shaped skirts and exquisitely voluminous dresses that dominated his runway. But Lang has too fine a sense of his own aesthetic for his designs ever to appear derivative. The ease of the silhouette, and the signature color palette—shades of basic tones with occasional shocks of color—were all his own. As if to stress the validity and timelessness of his practical philosophy, Lang made sure to open the show with his most recognizable classics—super-sharp pants and suits, street-smart coats and transparent tops. The results, especially in contrast with the gratuitous ornamentation often seen elsewhere, were more gratifying than ever.</p></div>"
48,fall,2000,f2000,hermes,"At Hermès, Martin Margiela created a bridge between things ultra-luxurious and utilitarian. During his tenure, he returned again and again to the humble pea jacket. For Fall 2000, it got the “transformable” treatment; offered in camel, it featured a removable collar and leather closures.</p><p>Also multipurpose were reversible toppers that could be rolled up and carried like a blanket on a leather strap. <em>Le pique-nique, c’est chic!</em> As for the showstopping crocodile skirt lined in lambskin, it counted as the absolute ne plus ultra of understated but undeniable glamour—with, <em>Vogue</em> reported, a $31,000 price tag.</p></div>"
49,fall,2000,f2000,jean-colonna,"At a moment when it seems like everything in fashion has gone positively dotty, dainty, polished and ruffled, Jean Colonna's fast-paced, hard-edged collection offered a refreshing change of mood. In his hands, the sweet, girly chiffon dresses that have taken over the runways have now become super-sexy, vampy attention-grabbers with zippers, sequins and appliqués. Jeans with leatherlike insets had frayed edges and piping, and leopard-print tops were worn under sheer blouses. How to top off the ""can't-wait-for-midnight"" look? With massive faux furs, golden motorcycle jackets and coats, transparent shoes and graphic, <em>Blade Runner</em>-inspired make-up.</p></div>"
50,fall,2000,f2000,jean-paul-gaultier,"Jean Paul Gaultier's collection was an ode to smoky Parisian chic—although at times it felt like an epic poem since those looks just kept on coming. Gaultier created a rain-drenched sidewalk as his runway became littered with cigarette butts in true Gallic fashion. His models came out provocatively dragging on Gauloises to a soundtrack featuring the soothing words of an anti-smoking therapist.</p><p>Gaultier wanted to create real-life looks that reflected ""the chic and elegance of daily life""—for the chic Parisienne perhaps—and threw in just enough of his customary playful inventions. These included vests with collars that folded into integral jackets and opera gloves with pockets just big enough for, well, a packet of cigarettes. Gaultier has reinvented the trench coat masterfully in his couture collections, and they put in an appearance here too--black and narrow and cut to the floor or as a perfect little coat-dress.</p><p>If it wasn't the characteristic show-stopping Gaultier drama, this collection was about a quiet elegance that, like his couture collections, paid subtle homage to Saint Laurent. YSL touches included the jersey chemise--here reworked as a tunic over pinstripe pants, featherlight chiffon pleat skirts, stylish ""smokings"" and all those mannish trilby hats.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""lttd0e""></div></div><p>Gaultier, who was already an established design force the first time around, showed timely '80s touches like the stirrup pants worn with viciously high heels and the bat-wing sleeve that appeared throughout the collection—proving his talents for invention and reinvention.</p></div>"
51,fall,2000,f2000,jeremy-scott,"The avant-garde met retail-credibility tonight as Jeremy Scott proved once again that he has the ability to turn out chic, salable clothes and still maintain an independent spirit. His show opened with a series of brown pinstriped looks that were, as always, inspired by the '80s, but looked thoroughly modern; logo bags, coats and turtlenecks cheekily referenced fashion's love affair with branding.</p><p>Scott's vision of evening wear consisted of tuxedo-printed T-shirts and bathing-suit dresses. Perhaps for the first time in history, a ruffled sweatshirt was presented as part of a smoking. For an appropriately dazzling finale, Scott revived early-Hollywood diva looks—serving up negligées, robes, satin gowns and Grecian columns that offered a sexy and humorous take on America's infatuation with iconic starlets.</p></div>"
52,fall,2000,f2000,john-bartlett,"Inspired by such iconic references as the film _Grey Gardens,_The Jockey in Paris and model Lisa Fonssagrives, John Bartlett presented a vamped-up, tongue-in-cheek collection that alluded to a bygone era of whimsical glamour. Bartlett relied on classic prints such as checks, chevron stripes and houndstooth, and reworked them in all shapes and sizes—some blown up so large that they were barely recognizable. Adding to the ""erotic heiresses"" theme were sexy fuchsia and chocolate leather pieces, capes with high-ruched necks and transparent tops. A couple of figure-hugging, double-knit wool jumpsuits, perfect for après-ski in Aspen, closed the sexy presentation.</p></div>"
53,fall,2000,f2000,john-galliano,"""Welcome to our Playground."" This time at Chez Galliano, those telling models' cue-cards were scripted in bright crayola colors and stuck with children's sweeties.</p><p>Yes, Galliano decided it was time for some serious dress-up, but after his flashy Dior show earlier in the week, he wasn't thinking of entrance-making Oscar gowns. Instead, he chose to further infantalize his models (many of whom have yet to break into their twenties), by casting them as little girls let loose with their mom's clothes—and maybe their pop's and sports-mad brother's too.</p><p>With all the pressure on him to continually invent the fashion wheel, and please the big guns at LVMH, Galliano apparently decided to regress to a cozier time. To a soundtrack that included the themes from '60s British kids' TV shows, Galliano's girls (and one or two experimental little boys too), clomped down the runway in mom's far-too-big shoes (perversely made with inner pockets to ensure that they actually did fit), their faces and sometimes clothes smeared with primary paint colors. A brother's huge soccer shirt (team Galliano); dad's giant cardigan; mom's mad '70s wallpaper print frock; her prom dress (stepped into the wrong way, twisting the bodice all to the front), were all assembled with a child's delightfully untrained eye.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""3skovb""></div></div><p>Some tattered but classic Galliano treasures could be salvaged from the dress-up box, but this was less a fashion show than an indulgent but enchanted Alice-in-Wonderland adventure into the comfort zone of barely remembered childhood.</p></div>"
54,fall,2000,f2000,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald decided to end London fashion week with a very loud bang. He attracted 1500 people to the Millennium Dome to see a brashy, flashy, trashy, vampy collection of barely-there evening gowns, asymmetrical frocks and almost-invisible miniskirts. Into this outrageous mix, he threw quite a lot of crazy printed fur coats, gilded serpent trousers and psychedelic jeans. The whole bizarre experience rounded up with a performance from Gwen Stefani and her band No Doubt. She was wearing bondage trousers and one of Julien Macdonald's fabulous pink coats. Fashion rocks!</p></div>"
55,fall,2000,f2000,junya-watanabe,"<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/junya-watanabe/"">Junya Watanabe</a>’s Techno Couture collection followed on the heels of his acclaimed Function and Practicality show, which featured simulated rain that proved his transformable get-ups were, indeed waterproof. For Fall his focus shifted from water to air. Despite his play with volumes, Watanabe’s Fall collection is perhaps the most ethereal he has ever created.</p><p>“One didn’t have to be a professional seamstress to understand the hard work that had been put into creating those large forms yet keeping the texture so delicate,” says model Vicky Andrén, 16 years after wearing them on the runway. “The outfits were perhaps not what I would be wearing on a daily basis.” She remembers them “mainly because the collection quite literally ‘stood out’ in such an extraordinary way.”</p><p>At first glance, the honeycomb ruffs Junya Watanabe showed in his Fall 2000 Techno Couture collection called to mind those seen in Rembrandt portraits, but we’re guessing those starched confections couldn’t fold and be stored in an envelope, like Watanabe’s. They certainly weren’t made of a “techno” fabric like polyester chiffon, from which the designer created his up-to-date and exaggerated take on the ruff, transforming it from an accessory to a garment with an organic-meets-space-age aesthetic. The material might have been unknown in Rembrandt’s time, but its method of production—hand sewing—certainly was.</p></div>"
56,fall,2000,f2000,kenzo,"""I tried to imagine what would happen if different minorities from all over the world met across time and space,"" said Gilles Rosier about his first solo collection for Kenzo. For his fast-paced, visually arresting show, Rosier reworked classic Kenzo favorites—loose shapes, colorful prints and patterns—into urban, modern looks that pay tribute to the house's heritage while decidedly moving ahead.</p><p>Supple leather coats and skirts were given a punk touch when paired with lace-up ankle boots, patchwork plaids and batwing tops; there was also a graphic '80s influence in a series of large geometric-motif dresses. A touch of the orient became apparent through the Japanese orchid prints, slit kimono sleeves and obi sashes that were seamlessly woven in. It was a successful, eclectic collection for Rosier, who proved that he can create a modern image for Kenzo while remaining true to his mentor's roots.</p></div>"
57,fall,2000,f2000,krizia,"Midnight blue, Afghanistan blue, China blue, Prussian blue—Krizia's collection demanded one word: blue. The effect was strangely hypnotic, forcing the audience to look more closely than usual at the cut and fit of the clothes. Tailored jackets and coats sported small rounded shoulders and important collars, while simple rectangles of fabric were worn as wraparound cloaks, with two side slits as armholes. Sheer pareos and scarves were layered and used as skirts. A welcome chromatic respite came in the form of tie-dyed spirals of white on cashmere knits, but the real surprise arrived at the end of the show: the sea of azure was interrupted by a series of jeweled evening dresses in peach, orange and rust that looked absolutely dazzling.</p></div>"
58,fall,2000,f2000,lanvin,"""Pretty"" is not a word that has been flying freely at the collections this season, but it is just the effect that Cristina Ortiz achieved at Lanvin. Her light-handed collection wafted along like a breath of sweet-scented fresh air after all of this week's smoky nightclub ambience.</p><p>Ortiz softened her hard geometry of past seasons, but continued to draw on graphic Art Deco motifs that referenced the slightly theatrical clothes that made Jeanne Lanvin a fashion star in the '20s. In Ortiz's sophisticated hands, and with her intriguing color mixes, the effects were never old-fashioned.</p><p>A jigsaw patchwork of lozenge-shapes, embroidered in silk or beads, resembled the work of Jean Dunand, the great '20s decorative artist. Ortiz used the patchwork in African colors for a stiff A-line skirt, or as a giant ""kipper"" tie, knotted over a black chiffon blouse. A sweater of sheared fur was crafted in color-shaded chevrons; a chiffon skirt or blouse had a whirlpool effect of swirling panels in beige, cocoa and sky. A Barbie-pink satin blouse, worn with peach chiffon bootleg pants, was an exclamation point of color. And Ortiz introduced subtle traces of gold—as in the borders on a skinny biscuit-colored fur bomber jacket; the hip-slung belt on a chiffon dress in ice-cream tones of coffee, framboise, lemon and peach; and in the platform-heeled golden sandals, their gilded soles flashing prettily as the high-stepping mannequins stalked the runway.</p></div>"
59,fall,2000,f2000,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele aptly calls his collection ""sophisticated, eccentric, ostentatious, daring, smart, sexy and languid."" The American designer relied on his well-known brand of glamour for this collection, and it shows. Printed tweed suits looked smashing when paired with fox mufflers and scarves; so did the flirty tulle dresses with embroidered overlay that opened the show. But Steele's forte is cocktail dressing, and he knows it. His ultrasleek, shimmering, liquid black-and-gold gowns and beaded sheer numbers are designed for women who want to make a statement and aren't afraid to stand out from the crowd.</p></div>"

Don't ask.</p><p>Pretentious theory aside, Rodriguez's show was a study in controlled elegance. His graphic little shift dresses and neat coats and pantsuits had the look of Jackie Onassis' sporty-deluxe wardrobe during the Ari years.</p><p>Deft leather work is the specialty of this classical Spanish house, and Rodriguez capitalized on the superb craftsmanship with contrast-insets in a Mondrian grid on those leather shifts, and refined chevron work. Subtle touches of hidden luxury included a warm-pink satin lining on the camel jacket of a mini suit, and matte caviar sequins on a chiffon evening mini. Rodriguez kept to an appropriately Spanish palette of black, honey-tan, palomino and a dash of lingerie-pink, and focused on understated luxury.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zzxtev""></div></div><p>You win the pop quiz if you can count the number of chevron black-and-white mink coats we've seen this season, but Rodriguez's held its own.

61,fall,2000,f2000,louis-vuitton,"As decade crunching continues to move forward at breakneck speed, it is inevitable that a designer as acutely attuned to the style buzz on the streets as Marc Jacobs should pick up and run with the '80s vibe currently setting a younger generation of style-makers on fire. For luxury house Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs revisits Paris in the '80s, paying homage to the looks featured in publications like the so-hip-it-hurts style manual <em>JILL</em>, and translating them into must-have modern looks.</p><p>The early Madonna moment—beret, oversized sweater slouched off one shoulder and short, leather pencil skirt--was skewered and chic-ed up with luxury fabrics. Think of that sweater in corduroy-seamed sheared fur, the skirt in satin thick as leather.</p><p>Early Montana and Mugler signatures were evoked in details like the decorative silver-press stud fastenings on the shoulder of a satin print T-shirt, silver cube buttons as closures on man-size jackets, curving seams on footballer-shouldered jackets and zippers diagonally splicing 7/8 coats. Jacobs' twisted palette also brought the decade flooding back—endless existentialist black of course, spiked with café au lait, chocolate, peppermint and teal (dazzling for a crocodile trouser suit). His tortoise-shell, sequined mini dresses closing the whirlwind show were suspended from—or trimmed with—the fine gold chain that was also used for the adorable midget disco purse—just big enough to hold that members' pass for disco hot spot Le Palace.</p></div>"
62,fall,2000,f2000,luca-luca,"A sheared fur-enveloped Ivana Trump was prominently seated in the front row at Luca Luca, as if to sum up the spirit of the collection, which consisted mostly of flashy zebra prints, formfitting black-, orange- and white-leather ensembles, and heavily beaded eveningwear. Texture came in the form of white rabbit jackets, black pleatherette suits and a turquoise alpaca coat. For anyone in need of a little extra oomph, there were also plenty of sequined cow-print skirts and overcoats, royal-blue sequined bustiers and shantung pants.</p></div>"
63,fall,2000,f2000,luella,"""Daddy, who were The Clash"" was the jokey little title of Luella Bartley's first catwalk show. Indeed her models wouldn't know—they were dressed like the hippest teenage schoolgirls, and probably born around 1987. It was hard not to adore the clothes—or the attitude. A neat houndstooth check dress was as proper as could be until you saw the zip up the back, which opened at both ends, and up on the arms. Hot pink drainpipe jeans with the word 'darling' written in tiny crystals on the back pocket and worn with a pink blouse and perfect-black jacket showed us all how the hip crowd will wear tailoring next season. There was even a striped school blazer worn with a white shirt and skinny trousers. Luella is way ahead of the pack. She's stylishly brought back the mod teenager, added a splash of Blondie and created an ultracool image for her label.</p></div>"
64,fall,2000,f2000,maison-martin-margiela,"“La mode du XXL” remained Margiela’s fixation through Spring into Fall 2000, though the latter show was more elegant and sculptural, with beautifully shaped sleeves and silhouettes, sized 74 and 78.</p></div>"
65,fall,2000,f2000,marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs continued doing what he does best: reinterpreting classic favorites with a refined, self-effacing skill. This time around, '70s wardrobe favorites—head-to-toe looks that call to mind a sophisticated feminist art dealer with a penchant for the organic—underwent his skillful surgical treatment. Jacobs turned out a series of accurate tweed suits with leather trim, cashmere-starved schoolgirl double-faced shift dresses, and sporty jackets embellished with buttons, oddly reminiscent of a subdued, time-warped Patrick Kelly. For the final portion of the show, Jacobs departed from his easygoing motif and ventured into a series of delicate, grown-up mille-feuille organza skirts, textured silk shirts, and ultra-light faille dresses in brick, grape, salmon, and rust.</p></div>"
66,fall,2000,f2000,mark-eisen,"Eisen's clothes have always been simultaneously sensual and practical, executed in sophisticated, figure-flattering fabrics. This season, the South African-born designer showed a neat, clean collection of tan leather coats and tops, luxuriously chunky knit sweaters and light Prince of Wales suits with leather piping. For evening, gauzy chiffon looks were both sweet and sexy while a series of feathered coats and skirts were pure glamour. His presentation touched upon many of the prevailing trends of the season, translating them into fun, easy-to-wear looks.</p></div>"
67,fall,2000,f2000,martine-sitbon,"In a season that has seen battalions of smoky '80s Parisienne looks stalk the runways, Martine Sitbon, who can rightly claim this territory as her particular and rightful property, has really come into her own. Black looks opened the show like a satin high-belted jacket over a skirt formed from a patchwork of matte and shine fabrics, or a bishop-sleeve blouse with stiff culottes. Then Sitbon smiled—on stylish purple, poison yellow or mustard-gold color-ways, dazzling against the patent runway.</p><p>Sitbon's slick urban effects are counterpointed with charming artisanal detailing. This season, standouts included overscale windowpane checks created from felted wool layers; a sweater of purple mink patchwork pieces; gigantic fabric roses blooming on a purple organza skirt; a flurry of handkerchief points as a playful corsage on a close-fitting sweater; and swags of ""chic punk"" fine chains as trim. There was even a Sitbon take on ladylike '60s Chanel, with a tweedy ivory mohair coat embroidered with a plaid design of gold thread, encapsulating the particularly Gallic brand of chic with a punk attitude that she has always championed.</p></div>"
68,fall,2000,f2000,matthew-williamson,"Mathew Williamson decided he wanted the audience to concentrate on the clothes, rather than on Jade Jagger's latest look, so he banished his famous fans from the front row to the after-party. It wasn't hard to focus since Williamson opened his show with an attention-grabbing dress made of skeins of crystal worn by the giraffelike Jodie Kidd. He followed this with a show inspired by the colors and shapes of stained-glass windows, with a very modern take. Black dresses with cutout work were backed with hot pinks, limes and oranges to create a very graphic look, and were lit up at the end of the show to great effect. But Williamson's softer pieces were where he excelled: There was a wonderfully chic black silk dress with beaded lime chiffon hidden under pleats; amazingly floaty fishtailed chiffon skirts; and my personal favorite, a Day-Glo yellow chiffon evening dress, backless and pulled in at the waist with a beaded back lace sash. This has to be one of the sexiest, most magical evening dresses I have seen so far this season. And in a season of suits, a splash of romance is utterly refreshing.</p></div>"
69,fall,2000,f2000,michael-kors-collection,"Big-city glamour was the inspiration for Michael Kors' dazzlingly rich, unabashedly ladylike show, which is sure to usher in a season of polished, sophisticated dressing. Kors reinterpreted decadent deco classics—sleek, tailored coats, languid blouses and body-hugging metallic columns—in a way that brilliantly crystallized the opulence of the current fashion moment. There were also textured tweed suits, sumptuous cashmere sweaters (which are currently being treated as essential, everyday staples) and healthy doses of fur and feathers for good measure. How to accessorize the 1930s by way of 2000? With large pearls everywhere, sleek pumps, Minnie-the-Moocheresque head wraps and fedora hats and ice-cool diamond belts, of course.</p></div>"
70,fall,2000,f2000,miguel-adrover,"Miguel Adrover confirmed with his second collection that he is one of the most creative new talents on the fashion scene. The Spanish designer clearly has an outstanding ability to identify the fashion moment, detect its undercurrents and transform them according to his unique sensibility. His presentation featured everything—from reconfigured garments made out of Burberry coats, Louis Vuitton purses and vintage denim to soft, feminine blouses with gathered sleeves, and strict, deftly tailored dresses with unfinished asymmetric hems. There were also functional plaid pants, chunky knits and ornate, spider-woven beaded evening dresses. The word is out: Adrover has shown that it is possible to maintain an independent creative spirit, and simultaneously produce chic, wearable clothes.</p></div>"
71,fall,2000,f2000,missoni,"It's a good fashion moment for Missoni. Prints and sophistication--both buzzwords for Fall—are the concepts upon which this well-known Italian fashion house was founded. Missoni's ideal of visual—and visible—elegance came alive on the runway with considerable zeal. Capitalizing on the current branding craze, Missoni used a zigzag ""M"" pattern as an oversize, tongue-firmly-in-cheek logo. There was also an emphasis on eclectic mixing and matching: beaded trousers, Lurex knits, liquid satins and comfy tweeds all came together in an extravagant potpourri of texture and color. How to top off the rich look? With sheared-fur bomber jackets, gold tights and matching shoes and bags.</p></div>"
72,fall,2000,f2000,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada reworked some of the most outstanding concepts of her signature line into accessible looks for Miu Miu, her diffusion label. It was an eminently wearable, simple and refined collection, centered on sweet, girly dresses—pale-rose chiffon slips, some gathered or bunched--and the season's all-important essential—the perfect jacket. Loose coats with rounded shoulders, ample shiny skirts and fitted tweed suits successfully acknowledged the '40s-inspired elegance present in much of the Fall collections. Pleated wool skirts were worn with casual striped tees, and optical-printed skirts and tops were playfully mixed and matched. Once again, Prada proved that diffusion lines can often compete with the best of the rest.</p></div>"
73,fall,2000,f2000,moschino,"<em>In anticipation of the upcoming Costume Institute exhibition,</em> “<a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/event/met-gala"">Camp: Notes on Fashion</a>,” <em>we’ve digitized collections from which pieces were selected for the show or catalog. This collection was presented in February 2000 in Milan.</em></p><p>“Witch one?” was the query scrawled across the set of this lighthearted Moschino show inspired by <em>The Wizard of Oz.</em> The first model carried a house-shaped handbag, and her otherwise straightforward gray pencil skirt was appliquéd with a dog resembling Toto. Other references to the story included striped “witchy” stockings worn by models, pairs of mannequin legs sticking up from the floor, and oilcan hats à la the Tin Man. Inspired by the famous ruby slippers were sparkly shoes, capes, and dresses flashing with sequins. Western cowboy looks and flying-nun ensembles were puzzling outliers.</p><p>Unlike Franco Moschino, his successor Rossella Jardini didn’t assume the role of commentator and critic, though she preserved the brand’s humor in a rather straightforward and mostly surface way. The campiest piece in this collection, according to the Costume Institute, was perhaps also the most poignant: an iron-shaped purse that could be seen as a nod to Franco Moschino’s white button-down shirt (also included in “Camp: Notes on Fashion,” from <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-1991-ready-to-wear/moschino"">Spring 1991</a>) that featured iron “burns” and the punny legend “Too Much Irony.”</p></div>"
74,fall,2000,f2000,narciso-rodriguez,"Leave it to Narciso Rodriguez to create the perfect little dress. The Cuban-American designer's forte has always been adding a touch of edginess to simple, chic classics, and this season he proved that he is still ahead of the game in that department. Silk charmeuse formed the base of his collection--showing up on dresses and slips that were worn alone or layered, alluding to a sensual state of partial undress. Rodriguez hardened the mood with sharp, tailored leather coats and cashmere tweed dresses. There were also sleek, fitted cashmere trousers and sexy, curve-hugging T-shirts. Clever accessories completed the look: Rodriguez featured luxurious alligator bags, decadent mink booties and hefty chains worn as necklaces and bracelets.</p></div>"
75,fall,2000,f2000,nicole-miller,"Nicole Miller devotees rely on the New York designer to translate the mood of the moment into reliable, affordable pieces. But this season, money and luxury were the inspiration for her opulent series of tweed, embroidered suits and corsets, multicolored-striped sweaters and rich paisley skirts. Miller added an especially extravagant touch to the lineup with fuzzy camouflage jackets, sleek leather pants and rabbit sweaters, bags and scarves. For evening, there were a series of jeweled looks, fox stoles, angora sweaters and even some elephant-skin jackets.</p></div>"
76,fall,2000,f2000,olivier-theyskens,"In just a few years, Belgian wunderkind Olivier Theyskens has established himself as one of the most powerful creative personalities in fashion. His show opened with a series of sleek, hard-edged leather pieces that suggested the need for protection, not only from the weather, but from urban life in general—long, bulky leather coats with zippers were worn with ruched long skirts and sleek pants that flared at the bottom. Great-looking tuxedo suits with side fastenings, knit sweater dresses (sometimes with the tuft of an even longer, voluminous skirt peeking out) and a modern take on legwarmers, that reliable '80s favorite, added to the eclectic mix. Of course, there were also a few breathtaking feats of construction—massive ball skirts worn as either part of a dress, or with an equally huge coat on top. It was a visually arresting presentation that assured Theyskens a prominent spot in fashion's future.</p></div>"
77,fall,2000,f2000,oscar-de-la-renta,"It was an easy-to-wear collection for Oscar de la Renta, who managed to turn out very relaxed pieces without forgoing his traditional feeling of luxury. Cashmere ruled the runway—showing up on colorful striped skirts, sweaters and knit cardigans. Brick, burgundy and navy coats and jackets were lavishly embroidered. There were also striking black ensembles in leather, suede and taffeta—perfect for a sexy evening out on the town. Of course, de la Renta's presentation could not be complete without dazzling evening wear—feather dresses, voluminous faille ball skirts worn casually with a sweater and iridescent paillette gowns, which closed the show with a big bang.</p></div>"
78,fall,2000,f2000,pamela-dennis,"In some circles, Pamela Dennis has built a reputation as a reliable purveyor of classic yet eye-catching eveningwear. This season, black leather was crucial to her collection, showing up on slim skirts and trousers that were paired with limestone gauze shirts and beaded camisoles. Graphite lamé organza ball skirts, crinkled skirts, stretch-wool cocktail dresses and gazar asymmetrical gowns completed the show.</p></div>"
79,fall,2000,f2000,philosophy,"The models at Philosophy smiled demurely as they showed off a sweet and girly collection. Alberta Ferretti successfully translated some popular trends of the season—including pulled-together, chic, ladylike elegance—into youthful, easy-to wear looks for her loyal following of sophisticated girls. Short pleated skirts in strong colors livened up tweed suits, while brilliant patterns and bright tights brought vibrance to simple day dresses. Accessories added an important edge to the collection: There were thin double-loop belts, dyed fur mufflers, triple buckles on skirts and printed foulards. For evening, Ferretti showed a series of featherlight, sophisticated chiffon dresses in black and white.</p></div>"
80,fall,2000,f2000,prada,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year nominee Miuccia Prada showed a strikingly beautiful collection. Sharp suits with narrow shoulders, defined waists and flowing skirts captured the spirit of the presentation, which was all about polished elegance and classic sophistication. Inspired by a '40s silhouette, Prada relied on an understated and tasteful color scheme: chocolate and gray dominated, with occasional dashes of yellow and red. For evening, Prada showed sexy velvet dresses with floral appliqués and a few silver beaded gowns that were absolute showstoppers. And, of course, you can always rely on Prada for some of the best accessories on the market: Her open-toed heels and geometric bags were an instant hit with the fashion crowd.</p></div>"
81,fall,2000,f2000,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Preen is an underground outfit that has steadily built up something of a cult following. Incredibly hip and ultra-trendy, designers Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi bring the London Street to the runway in a very effective manner. The red skirtsuit with a bow at the neck was the most modern take on the suit I have seen this season; a little black dress had marvelously Gothic pointy shoulders and a ton of cool attitude. Chiffons appliquéd with leather were super-sexy; a pale pink sweater, with its overly high neck and giant wool rose at the shoulder, would hit the spot whether you were at Balthazar or Meow Mix. I call it Edgy Chic.</p></div>"
82,fall,2000,f2000,ralph-lauren,"""There's a new kind of glamour that's polished, sleek and sexy,"" said Ralph Lauren about his collection of simple, elegant American classics. Suits played a key role for Lauren this season—black, fitted jackets and sharply detailed trousers and skirts were worn with casual cashmere crewnecks and ivory silk blouses. Fair Isle sweaters accompanied comfortable Donegal tweeds and steely leather pants. Striking crocodile car coats and broadtail trousers added a shot of opulence to the presentation, as did the evening dresses: There were body-conscious satin and jersey gowns, as well as Persian-motif embroidered gowns that are sure to cause a stir at any event.</p></div>"
83,fall,2000,f2000,randolph-duke,"It was a characteristically flamboyant presentation for Randolph Duke, who has never been known to shy away from sexy curves, ornate beading and overall decoration. Double-face wool knits in black, camel and grey, herringbone separates and wool suits opened the show. Evening progressed into chevron-beaded pants, sparkly tweeds with ostrich feathers and houndstooth motifs done up in plumes. To top it all off, there were chinchilla cuffs, dyed-fox shoulder slings and super-luxe sables.</p></div>"
84,fall,2000,f2000,richard-tyler,"Richard Tyler built his career on his strength as a tailor, and on the success of the high-powered, glamorous pieces he created for Hollywood stars—which explains his penchant for sharp lines and eye-catching details. Tyler showed a series of tweed coats and skirts with snakeskin belts and trim, plaid jackets and houndstooth pants, tulle tops with voluminous ballet skirts and easy-going shirtdresses. For evening, there were shiny Chinese-embroidered jacquard looks in light blue, orange and pink, as well as sexy chiffon jersey ruffle dresses.</p></div>"
85,fall,2000,f2000,robert-cary-williams,"A jeep smashing through a wall of white paper, a moving forest, wire fencing, London’s oldest railway arches: These images formed the backdrop for Robert Cary-Williams’ third show, which was ultra London, ultra avant-garde and ultra brilliant. To Cary-Williams, clothes are something to be deconstructed and then reconstructed with ingenious zips and seaming. Take his idea of a dress—a cream, devoré satin-slip dress hung by one thread off one shoulder, hung by a zip off the other and frayed at the ends, with one side trailing on the floor. Or a shirt—make it in black cotton, bind it with ties around the waist and then add intricately pleated cuffs that zip off. For coats, Cary-Williams took a tough olive cotton trench that had an asymmetric collar and one strap at the bottom that made it just off-kilter enough to be edgy. He also had a black version, minus that naughty little strap, that was unbelievably chic and wearable. So, there was only one wearable piece in the show, but Cary-Williams is still working out his style and his attitude—he has as much potential as Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan did at the beginning. We’ll wait for the cocktail dresses.</p><p>A footnote, literally: Sandra Choi, the designer at Jimmy Choo, has created some nuttily fabulous shoes for this show. They were men’s brogues in pale skin-colored leather, which had been molded in water on a foot, leaving imprints of toes in the shoes. Very original. Very odd. Very alternative-chic.</p></div>"
86,fall,2000,f2000,roland-mouret,"This boy (OK, he's 39 but looks like a kid) just gets chic-er and chic-er. Mouret's talent is to sew without seams—many of his dresses are just one piece of fabric that is held together with a single humble safety pin. As a result, his dresses have a lightness of touch that is almost unrivaled. His show, located in Borough High Street, SE1, featured a photographic studio as a set, with the models posing as though on a shoot. This gave us ample time to get a good look at sheer chiffon shirts in electric blue with giant bows, several versions of the little black dress—some floor length, some sexily backless, all very graphic and modern-looking—as well as a perfect Yves Saint Laurent-inspired trouser suit and a Poiret-esque coat. Mouret's only decoration was a giant '60s-style rose at the neck on some of the pieces that was reminiscent of the famous Chanel camellia. The ladies, and the coolsters, will be lining up.</p></div>"
87,fall,2000,f2000,ruffo-research,"Belgian design team A.F. Vandervoorst has come to define a new kind of laid-back cool. Designing their second collection for Ruffo Research, the duo turned their attention to the Harley-Davidson set. Their presentation took place in a large space decorated like a beer hall—the perfect setting for rugged motorcycle men and their babes to display a series of plush furs, tan shearling pullovers with unfinished edges and long leather coats. There were also trompe-l’oeil leather jeans and jackets, and leather trousers treated to look like corduroy. More urban were the long asymmetric skirts and cropped bomber jackets, worn with calf-high boots. In all, A.F. Vandervoorst presented a fun, witty line that underscores Ruffo Research’s growing reputation as one of the most interesting breeding grounds for highly original talent.</p></div>"
88,fall,2000,f2000,russell-sage,"Young designer Russell Sage called his show, ""So Sue Me."" His inspiration was the logo mania of the moment, and he took some famous fashion references—like the Burberry trench—and reconfigured them for the avant-garde. The Burberry check was worn as a vest with a cobalt blue, sequined, puffed-sleeve top underneath; Tommy Hilfiger's rock 'n' roll collection of last season was satirized in a rough hessian corset that read TOMMY ROCKS in red beads across the front.</p><p>Among the craziness there were some good ideas—like the faded blue mac with frayed hem and a lining that resembled gold leaf, the amazing take on Elizabethan sleeves and the way that chiffon was used as an outer layer over solids rather than as an inner layer. There was even an old Union Jack flag that had been burnt, appliquéd with gold paillettes and turned into an outrageous skirt. It's recycling for the chic set—very street, very UK.</p></div>"
89,fall,2000,f2000,saint-laurent,"With his third runway show for Yves Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz finally hit the target with a controlled collection that proved a strong modern take on the house's timeless chic. Elbaz elongated and chiseled the classic proportions of the trademark boxy jackets and pencil skirts, and showed them with black glove-leather shirts with matching narrow ties--a cool, modern spin for the classic YSL suit. With satin revers on an overscale man's Crombie coat, he also gave a contemporary twist to ""le Smoking.""</p><p>Moving away from the house's enduring '40s references, Elbaz's models wore their hair in severe French twists and stalked the runway in vicious stiletto-heeled shoes. Tabard coats and dresses, worn over skinny rib knits, and a trio of priestly black jersey robes, allowed Elbaz to express his austere side.</p><p>Leaving <em>grand soir</em> statements to the master himself and the haute couture collection he continues to design, Elbaz sent out only short, after-dark looks for his finale. Classic metallic lace looked chic again, in long-sleeved midi dresses styled with hip-slung crocodile belts and wrinkled '70s cavalier boots. Great-looking tarnished brass lamé suits with black chiffon blouses, body-skimming cocktail dresses in black slipper-satin, and entrance-making flapper dresses—solid with brilliant silver bugle beads—were followed by a final stylish take on a YSL classic—the sheer black chiffon blouse with a skirt made entirely of ostrich feathers.</p></div>"
90,fall,2000,f2000,sonia-rykiel,"Knit-maven Sonia Rykiel's influence has been felt on runways all over town this season, and in London, Milan and New York too. Think of all those skinny '70s knit sweaters, the glitter stripes and accessories, the jewel-dotted berets, those fluorescent-bright accents on black. So it was great to see La Rykiel, flame-haired grandmother to all these trends, in such glittering good form.</p><p>Rykiel delved into her archives for great '70s and '80s references that look as hip today as they ever did. The '70s looks ran the gamut from Annie Hall layers (spiced up with cone-heeled colored metallic disco shoes) to a black-jersey tabard over lipstick-red sequin leggings. Deco sunburst intarsias on plum and cyclamen knits; a chocolate-and-red overscale plaid with a Burberry feel; a striped fur <em>Flashdance</em> sweater over skintight pants; and a sheared black fur sweatshirt and mini were also upbeat takes on current fashion hits.</p><p>Even Rykiel's archaic way of presenting clothes is so out that it's in again, from the opening lineup with a row of girls (hair frizzed à la Rykiel) in different color-spectrum versions of the same wide jersey Oxford ""bag"" pants and stole, to the Old World tradition of sending out a bride. Especially when the bride is the hot young British model Liberty Ross, and her knit twinset, beret and full taffeta skirts are in tones of the season's must-have orchid purple with a playfully overscaled ruby-red mink daisy tucked at the waist.</p></div>"
91,fall,2000,f2000,thimister,"Showing in his new showroom space—an atmospheric turn-of-the-century Parisian atelier—Josephus Thimister’s collection was an exercise in subtlety. Hairstylist Odile Gilbert’s pink- and grey-powdered eighteenth-century looks—on both men and women—reflected a mood gently suggested by Thimister via Beau Brummel collars on poplin blouses, and close-to-the-body frock coats in stiff felted wools.</p><p>Confined to an exquisite palette of <em>bois de rose,</em> bone, ink, dulled silver and tobacco, Thimister made his a message of continuity, revisiting his trademark pieces. The sheath dress with a draped wrap in back, or pelican cowl in front, was reconsidered in glazed linen or ribbed platinum lamé. Thimister’s signature mohair hand-knits appeared as overscaled sweaters over side-swagged skirts, or as slim evening dresses dusted with tarnished silver sequins and ribbon thread—or even as a fragile evening stole for a shining evening sheath worn by enduringly beautiful ’60s supermodel Benedetta Barzini. Thimister’s oatmeal mohair hand-knit cardigan with platinum lamé pants was also the most contemporary take on the vintage Chanel redux that has proved a collection’s keynote—a subtle homage to another designer who believed in evolutionary fashion.</p></div>"
92,fall,2000,f2000,tommy-hilfiger,"""High-octane Ivy League"" is how Tommy Hilfiger described his coed collegiate collection, which revolved around sporty, All-American preppy looks. Houndstooth and Donegal tweed suits were worn with light turtleneck sweaters; A-line skirts were finely tailored, light and feminine. Scottish tartans in green, navy, red and white dominated the runway, showing up in the lining of classic coats, on easy-fitting pants and shirts (often made up of mismatched panels) and even on a handcrafted leather and suede skirt. Shrunken jackets in metallic leather, calf-hair dresses and suede pants covered with leather appliqués that created a tiger print added a fun and whimsical touch to the presentation.</p></div>"
93,fall,2000,f2000,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber is London's king of leather—a fabric which he contorts and reinvents with amazing style and flair. He is also a fanatically inventive tailor, whose curvaceous seaming mimics human muscle structure. Combine the two, and you have a very chic, sleek look that is now becoming a convincing signature for this designer. On the more wearable side, Webber had a slim white punched leather skirtsuit that was as edgy as it was classy; geometrically patchworked raw-shearling coats; and a sharp green leather jacket with cutout work so intricate it resembled stitching. On the creative side, Webber pulled out a stretched neon-green mesh top with mask attached; delicate green, red and white chiffon dresses and some terrifyingly tight leather frocks. Undoubtedly influenced by early Alaïa and Mugler, Webber makes the skintight vixen-look new.</p></div>"
94,fall,2000,f2000,trussardi,"It was a veritable fur-and-skin fiesta at Trussardi. Full-on luxury was the hallmark of a series of head-to-toe looks, like the sheared fur dress with python trim and matching bag and pumps that opened the show. Trussardi's logo, the sprinting greyhound, made a dashing appearance everywhere—from purse- and belt-clasps to printed cardigan twinsets and even cuff links. Evening consisted mostly of black satin dresses, also adorned with snakeskin trim. Massive fur and leather coats were accessorized with Trussardi's signature travel valises.</p></div>"
95,fall,2000,f2000,tse,"British designer Hussein Chalayan is known for his exacting attention to detail—which is present in both his signature line and his designs for TSE. This season, Chalayan turned out a series of color-blocked looks—pale gray, rose, taupe, grass and cobalt blue turned up in asymmetric jackets, ribbon-hem skirts and corduroy pants with leather trim. There were also a few sweet cotton and silk dresses with embroidered tulle overlay, and cashmere map-print sweaters. It was a tranquil, reposed collection that artfully explored the interaction between color and shape.</p></div>"
96,fall,2000,f2000,tuleh,"""Women who really care about their clothes are a fascinating bunch,"" read Tuleh's show program. Evidently, Tuleh knows exactly what their ladies want. This season, it was highly polished glamour—in the form of pert jackets, fitted fur coats and tailored pencil skirts. There was something for every occasion: from a shiny green military-inspired trench dress to plaid suits, sassy turtlenecks and sleek pants. Eveningwear was equally accomplished and varied: beaded tops, long overcoats and one-shoulder dresses. It was a classic, elegant collection that perfectly suited the venue in which it was shown: New York's tony Regency Hotel.</p></div>"
97,fall,2000,f2000,valentino,"If this is the season for ladylike clothes, this is Valentino's moment. No sly irony here, though. His real-life ladies lead a pampered limo life, apparently unchanged since the Duchess of Windsor's day. In fact, Wallis would have loved the '40s flared-skirt cocktail suits worn with fox muffs, the starburst of seams on the front of a double-face coat and the standout slim lace shirt-dress to the floor, embroidered with a trace of golden sequins and sashed in ivory chiffon.</p><p>But the fussier effects may not have received that royal seal of approval. After some recent adventures in chic simplicity, Valentino now leaves no surface unembellished. Of course, if anyone can approximate haute couture detailing in ready-to-wear, it is he. A turtleneck sweater has a twist of evening gown drapery across the bosom; a cappuccino tweedy coat is hemmed in Persian lamb and embroidered roses. And that's just for starters.</p><p>After dark, Valentino really pulls out all the stops. His more subtle looks worked bes—like a quartet of scarlet crepe cocktail dresses and the most luxurious trenchcoat in town reimagined as an opera coat, cut full to the floor in either champagne raw silk, black or Valentino red duchesse-satin. And let's hope that Va-Va's ladies own wardrobe trunks large enough to pack those giant crinoline ball gowns ruffled with organza fins—and that they find somewhere to wear them!</p></div>"
98,fall,2000,f2000,vera-wang,"Vera Wang is famous for combining couture-worthy craftsmanship with the practicality of American ready-to-wear, and her fall collection was true to her roots. It consisted of classic, elegant pieces in rich materials, cut with careful precision. Wang showed stretch tweed suits, cashmere pullovers, black crocodile coats and gabardine pleated skirts—and they all worked together. But Wang never forgets that she is most famous for her eveningwear, and she did not disappoint: There were square sequin gowns, chiffon halters, cashmere robes and a couple of show-stopping, neon-colored scarf dresses.</p></div>"
99,fall,2000,f2000,versace,
100,fall,2000,f2000,versus-versace,"Donatella Versace proved today that she is the undisputed queen of sexy glamour. The runway at Versus exploded with blocks of overlapped color, graphic prints and outsize flowers—all artfully packaged in a a sleek, controlled silhouette. Blazers were closely fitted, trousers were sharply creased and liquid dresses seemed to dance on the body. There was a variety of leather looks, ranging from a long purple coat to laminated sheepskin jackets. Of course, no Versace collection is ever complete without a touch of outrageousness: Donatella sprinkled cabochon studs and chains on short lace dresses, and turned out a series of velvet and sheared-velour evening numbers that are sure to set the night on fire.</p></div>"
101,fall,2000,f2000,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro clearly has one objective in mind when designing: to make women look as glamorous as humanly possible. This time around, his archetypal woman went out to play—mixing and matching leather motorcycle jackets in vibrant colors with easy, chunky knits, sexy crocodile belts and sleek, long slacks. Optical prints, reminiscent of '70s upholstery fabric, looked surprisingly chic in low-slung trousers and long coats; plaid fringed skirts, blush silk jackets and grape chiffon evening dresses screamed for cocktails in Aspen. Overall, it was an eclectic, artfully combined collection that successfully dared to explore a variety of influences.</p></div>"
102,fall,2000,f2000,vivienne-tam,"""I've mixed the romanticism of the Orient with sensual silhouettes to create a look that is feminine, yet hard-edged,"" said Vivienne Tam about her collection, which celebrated the Chinese New Year. Gold was the dominant color for a series of fun looks that included chrysanthemum-beaded dresses, velveteen coats with fur trims and metallic-embroidered shells. There were also shimmering optical prints, sequin starburst dresses and purple leather trousers that were thoroughly urban and modern. Tam's clean designs were enlivened with texture, color and shine to create an eclectic and thoroughly upbeat show.</p></div>"
103,fall,2000,f2000,wink,"""American Gothic"" was the theme for Wink's '80s-inspired collection, which included direct references to such pop-culture icons as The Smiths. T-shirts and leggings were inscribed with ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" in bold letters; dark, loose coats, reminiscent of Ally Sheedy in _The Breakfast Club_were worn with zip pants and flat ankle boots. There were also pleated skirts, low-waisted sweatshirt dresses and satin-cuffed jeans—ideal urban-combat gear. The show ended with a navy-washed strapless dress—the one that the bad, pretty girl, who in junior high smoked in between classes, would have worn to the prom.</p></div>"
104,fall,2000,f2000,yohji-yamamoto,"Against a hypnotic soundtrack of chants that seemed part Native-American, part Tibetan, Yohji Yamamoto sent out a bravura collection that suggested a luxurious cocooning against an arctic winter.</p><p>In the poetic Yamamoto tradition, his models looked like the brides of Mongolian or Tartar warriors. The designer's light touch also ensured that the potentially cumbersome volumes—sweeping ankle-length coats with deep-set sleeves, layered over full skirts—were controlled via airy duvet linings and decorative hand-stitched quilting.</p><p>Yamamoto used fur--real fox and faux wolf—to circle hoods and collars and to bristle from beneath the hems of padded crinoline skirts, as well as for such swaggering accessories as overscaled Cossack hats, loop stoles, gauntlets and muffs. He juxtaposed the magnificence of jacquard fabrics—their patterns suggesting antique paisley shawls—with the savage edge of animal skins, transformed into fitted sheaths. These were deftly seamed to follow the skins' natural ragged edges—a theme brilliantly developed in layered fabric pieces, with the hems cut in ragged imitation of those animal pelts. An Inuit-inspired couple and their enchanting swaddled baby closed the show, suggesting the sensuous pleasures of wrapping up against the cold.</p></div>"

2,spring,2001,s2001,alberta-ferretti,"The models at Alberta Ferretti never looked hurried or overly styled. They smiled sweetly as they walked the runway; the attitude at a Ferretti show is always as casual as the clothes.</p><p>Ferretti relied on small touches to give her looks personality: topstitching on practical navy coats, delicate embroidery on sheer day dresses and contrasting edging on the hems of her light skirts. Diagonal pleats, strategically placed darts and occasional ruffles gave the looks plenty of body-skimming movement. Ferretti also showed sleek, bright orange jackets, sexy wrap tops and a sensational draped dress with a knot in the front. For evening there were long caftan tunics with contrasting trims and subtle beading on the neckline.</p></div>"
3,spring,2001,s2001,alessandro-dell-acqua,"There was a seemingly endless procession of looks at Alessandro Dell'Acqua, including everything from mint-julep leather overcoats to translucent tops and chiffon skirts gathered at the side.</p><p>A green Lurex bikini suddenly gave way to a black blazer worn with a nude shirt and denim skirt; there were also very short shorts, straight trousers with a racing stripe down the side, sporty cardigan jackets and layered chiffon slips—arguably everything and anything a woman could need for Spring.</p><p>Nonetheless, the collection lacked direction, and after surveying so many variations of the season's main trends, it was practically impossible to discern any outstanding pieces.</p></div>"
4,spring,2001,s2001,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen's show was nothing short of monumental. The audience sat around a mirrored cube, which, when lit from inside, revealed itself to be a mental-hospital holding cell. Demented girls, wearing hospital headbands and everything from extraordinary mussel-shell skirts to impossibly chic pearl-colored cocktail dresses, slithered and strutted while uselessly attempting to fly over the cuckoo's nest.</p><p>McQueen was at his very best: There were gothic, theatrical pieces, like a dress with a miniature castle and rat posing as a shoulder pad; a top made out of a jigsaw puzzle; and a huge feathered creation with stuffed eagles suspended over the model's head, poised to attack à la Hitchcock. But amidst all the insanity, there was a cornucopia of startlingly elegant—and wearable—pantsuits, flouncy party dresses, and even a spectator pump or two.</p><p>How to top off such a climactic presentation? After everyone thought it was all over, another cube within the psychiatric ward-cum-runway opened up to reveal a portly nude woman, her face covered by a mask, breathing through a tube, surrounded by fluttering moths. It was a truly shocking and enthralling tableau: Francis Bacon via Leigh Bowery and Lucien Freud. In a word, sublime.</p></div>"
5,spring,2001,s2001,alexandre-matthieu,"Since winning the competition at the prestigious Hyères Fashion Festival in 1999, the Parisian duo of Alexandre Morgado, 25, and Matthieu Bureau, 26, have caused quite a stir with their star-burst colors, circus characters and cartoon-like appliqués. ""Our work references everything from beauty contests to Las Vegas games, from Hollywood starlets to Parisian cabaret,"" says Morgado. ""We bring new fashion elements to a vocabulary of clichés.""</p><p>Indeed they do. Alexandre Matthieu's sharp-shouldered blazers with bright stripes and asymmetric lapels, double-layered dresses with glamour-girl prints, and graphic snap-side tanks have already been picked up by forward-thinking boutiques such as Brown's, Colette, and Zao. Björk wore their now-famous black-and-pink striped dress to the Cannes Film Festival, generating instant media frenzy. The duo went on to receive an important grant from the French ministry of culture and, more recently, financial sponsorship from LVMH.</p><p>With only one formal collection under their belts, it already seems certain that there's a bright future ahead for Morgado and Bureau. ""We want to offer people a positive and optimistic view of fashion,"" they say. ""We design for women who believe in fairy tales.""</p></div>"
6,spring,2001,s2001,alice-roi,"Alice Roi, 24, is a native New Yorker with degrees from New York University and Parsons School of Design in fine arts and fashion design. Although she has designed only four collections, Roi already has been tapped to consult with Anna Molinari for her Spring 2001 collection and is set to launch a line of shoes with the British luxury line Gina. Roi's Spring collection was a rocking tribute to the '80s in all of its glorious excess: Leggings, minis, bows, batwing sleeves and white stilettos (customized with graffiti and mini padlocks) were some of the looks that Roi revisited with ironic wit and humor.</p></div>"
7,spring,2001,s2001,ann-demeulemeester,"Strong women abound for Spring 2001—but few look tougher or sexier than Demeulemeester's chic-punk chicks. Black isn't back for these ready-to-rumble types; it never went away.</p><p>Metallic band straps literally held together Demeulemeester's collection: Loose blazers were cinched with built-in belts that could be fastened tightly around the waist or left to hang around the hips. Hair pieces were draped over dresses and attached at the neck. And there were several sensational miniskirts made entirely of—what else? —metal snaps, which can be fastened as tightly or loosely as the moment calls for. Demeulemeester rounded off her collection with less aggressive but equally intriguing tie-dyed suede suits and skirts, knit sweaters with wide, loose sleeves and comfortably flared trousers. In short, the urban warrior's modern wardrobe.</p><p>Ann Demeulemeester proved that she is a designer who can constantly find new ways to reinvent herself; there is always more to her designs than meets the eye.</p></div>"
8,spring,2001,s2001,anna-sui,"There were two sides to Anna Sui's collection: a stark, punk-influenced series of slashed black jersey tops, dresses and skirts with crisscross straps, metal studs and butch-belle belts, and an array of embroidered and embellished printed chiffon and crepe ensembles. Sui would've done well to stick with the former—the moment girly prints, fringed bags and raffia anything came along, the powerful image fell apart.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the three most directional looks were worn by Belgian model Hannelore, who is fast emerging as a poster face for the new haute-punk and the more street-savvy reinterpretations of the '80s. She wore a simple white silk cowl-neck dress that looked perfectly right, a purple mesh dolman dress, and a one-shouldered black jersey number that would've worked equally well at CBGB in 1985 or at a cocktail reception in the downtown Guggenheim right now.</p></div>"
9,spring,2001,s2001,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi is known for his sharp tailoring skills and overtly sexual aesthetic, which makes this a good moment for the Italian-born, London-trained designer. His blazers were fitted, clipped at the waist and paired with straight, sleek trousers; a beige suede pantsuit had an extra flap of material that draped on one side of the jacket when it was buttoned.</p><p>But it was the dresses that stood out the most—from a black chemise with a wide, triple-buckle belt, to a scoop-necked chartreuse number with a ruched waist, and a black, one-shouldered gathered dress with a deflated balloon bottom. To indulge his racier side, Berardi also showed tan microshorts, a teensy bikini and dominatrix-inspired brassieres attached to fitted, corsetlike tops.</p></div>"
10,spring,2001,s2001,arkadius,"There was certainly no shortage of creativity at Arkadius' bizarrely bucolic London show. The Polish designer turned to his homeland for inspiration, referencing farm life with colorfully trimmed linens, flowing cottons and foulards wrapped around the head.</p><p>Intrigued by how little the style of dressing in his country has changed, Arkadius took it upon himself to suggest new possibilities. With skillful draping, ruching and cutting, he managed to turn perfectly quaint frocks into sexy, in-your-face ensembles. Arkadius' new country maiden wears slinky strapless dresses with colorful bird prints, white leather pants with gathered sides or cutouts, frayed topstitched jeans with ankle boots, and slash-cut skirts. But that's not all: there was a blood- (or faux blood-) drenched shirt, a top made out of straw and plastic birds, and a model carrying a dress suspended by two poles in front of her.</p><p>Arkadius delivered an invigorating burst of energy after the more commercial collections of New York, yet his presentation was at times repetitive and would have benefited from some careful editing.</p></div>"
11,spring,2001,s2001,as-four,"The future of fashion, at least according to creative team As Four, lies in collaboration, not the personality cult of superstar designers. For the last couple of years, Ange, Gabi, Kai and Adi—who hail from Russia, Lebanon, Germany and Israel, respectively, and prefer not to use last names—have lived as a family in a silver-painted loft in downtown New York where they create body-enveloping “embryo suits,” spiral-cut trousers and the famous metallic-print circle bags that Björk regularly carries. A year ago, As Four’s first-ever presentation consisted of battery-powered, miniature “hula dolls” that spun around on a large table wearing quirky paper outfits. For Spring 2001, the group opted for a slightly more conventional route—a runway show-turned-concert /carnival. Local bands played, acrobats twirled about, and girls strutted onstage wearing massive chiffon skirts and street-tough twisted-seam jeans. No doubt a spectacular presentation, but who will actually wear As Four’s whimsical designs? “Anybody who's true to themselves and has real style,” says Gabi confidently—“whether it’s a woman shopping at Colette in Paris or walking down the streets of Chinatown.”</p></div>"
12,spring,2001,s2001,badgley-mischka,"Technicians worked up to the very last minute on the runway at Badgley Mischka, removing their equipment just as the lights dimmed and an imperious soundtrack worthy of an overproduced Disney epic signaled Caroline Ribeiro's glittering appearance in a gold and silver embroidered shirtdress. The look was pure Badgley Mischka: sexy, slinky and attention-grabbing —as were the chiffon wrap skirts, gold beaded pants and off-the-shoulder sheer dresses that followed.</p><p>But those were just the simple day looks; the evening gowns are what flashbulb-starved Hollywood types covet most. Come Academy Award time, the predictable pack of Swarovski-mad stylists will be on the hunt for those essential body-clinging, light-reflecting, cleavage-baring, curve-hugging, thigh-revealing, heavily embroidered floor-length creations. And, at Badgley Mischka, they will find plenty to choose from.</p></div>"
13,spring,2001,s2001,balenciaga,"Every few years, a designer comes along who dramatically alters the way we see fashion, defying categorization, eschewing conventional references and barreling ahead with highly individual ideas. Nicolas Ghesquière is proving to be one of those extremely rare talents.</p><p>As always, Ghesquière's collection for Balenciaga was well edited and to the point: no need for endless repetition here. The show opened with short overall dresses with loose black blazers, no-nonsense shirts with diagonal strip insets, tiny miniskirts and slim, sleek trousers. Blousy off-the-shoulder tops and asymmetrically cut, full skirts were generously ruffled, pleated, embroidered and gathered, and twisted and manipulated every which way. Wide belts with insets, dangling cords and strands of pearls broke the silhouette and provided a corsetlike effect.</p><p>The initial feeling at Balenciaga was one of blissful, extravagant chaos—but by the end of the show it all fell quietly into place and made perfect sense.</p></div>"
14,spring,2001,s2001,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria has built a substantial business translating the trends of the moment into accessible, easy-to-wear basics—the kind of clothes aspiring L.A. actresses quickly throw on before zipping off to casting calls in their sporty borrowed convertibles.</p><p>This season, for example, there were sensible top-stitched cotton double-faced jackets and trousers (perfect for that last-minute agent meeting), pistachio silk chiffon printed dresses that are a cinch to pack, and an eye-catching rose-bloom tweed trenchcoat. For younger customers, there was also an off-white patent-leather trenchcoat, a cedar-brown patent-leather skirt, and graphic, two-tone wedge heels that should be a hit with die-hard <em>Barbarella</em> fans.</p></div>"
15,spring,2001,s2001,betsey-johnson,"Forget about carbohydrate-phobic supermodels: A wild pack of Playboy bunnies, complete with glittering furry ears, triple-F cups and skyscraper heels stormed the tents at Bryant Park today. It was all part of neon-haired and notoriously outrageous designer Betsey Johnson's playful Spring fashion romp.</p><p>Johnson's 80-plus looks were divided into 12 segments—one for each month of the year. Real-life Playboy Playmates cruised the catwalk wearing barely there georgette dresses, rhinestone-encrusted bikinis, sequined tube tops and ""bunny belle"" strapless dresses. There were also voluminous (but always short) layered tulle skirts, flamenco dresses, and festive paisley wraps in all shades of fuchsia. Johnson even showed her version of a bridal outfit—a skimpy white satin corsetlike suit accessorized with a little bow tie, a trail of scandalous bridesmaids and not much else.</p></div>"
16,spring,2001,s2001,bill-blass,"Newly-appointed Bill Blass designer Steven Slowik had a tall order to fill today: create a collection that lived up to Bill Blass' legacy of classic elegance, while attracting Park Avenue's younger generation of socialites.</p><p>Slowik took his first steps toward that lofty objective by reworking some Blass favorites: The show opened with a limpid white suit and a cotton and chiffon dress that were both very promising. There were also a couple of comfortably chic masculine suits with feminine accents like visible hints of the jackets' lining on the lapel. Having said that, Slowik still has quite a way to go. His kimono dresses were not particularly flattering; large orchid prints on a suit and dress looked overdone; and the sequined evening looks were too long and shapeless for a young girl, and too decorated for a more mature client. In short, many of the clothes were neither here nor there.</p></div>"
17,spring,2001,s2001,bottega-veneta,"London street-smarts met Milanese opulence at Bottega Veneta in what was one of the most hard-core, tough-cool collections of the week.</p><p>Any hint of dowdiness from the past is gone for good at Bottega. Designer Laura Moltedo and stylist Katie Grand moved forward at breakneck speed with black, hot pink and orange big-collared leather dresses, gathered skirts and knit-leather silver jackets. The music blared as a tribe of punky girls stormed the catwalk wearing one-shoulder tops, fluorescent green-and- orange leopard-print pantsuits, leather-paillette tank dresses with a buckle strap, and oversize sweatshirt tops.</p><p>How to accessorize the hard chic-chick look? With enormous sunglasses, woven leather pumps and graffiti-sprayed oversize clutches, of course.</p></div>"
18,spring,2001,s2001,boudicca,"The design team of Boudicca presented today one of their most wearable collections to date, centered around crisp white shirts and sharply tailored, high-waisted trousers and skirts. Naturally, there were still plenty of the duo's signature touches, like wide sashes across a strict top or tiny hidden drawstrings that cinch in unexpected places.</p><p>Boudicca's severe, almost austere collection relied on black and white as the predominant colors, and on an architectural silhouette that brought to mind the precise lines of Gianfranco Ferrés' lean, mean suits. The (even) sexier looks consisted of one-shouldered dresses with streamers, skirts with a derrière-high slit on the back and a pair of leather briefs that tied on the side. The most accessible dresses were saved for last—simple pale-rose-printed shifts with black panel insets and wide belts.</p></div>"
19,spring,2001,s2001,bruce,"Since they showed their first collection six seasons ago, Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, the team known as Bruce, have amassed a cult New York following who rely on their buttery-soft leathers and figure-hugging jeans. But with their Spring 2001 collection, Bruce proved that they have plenty more to offer—and that they are ready for the big time.</p><p>There was nothing superfluous or irrelevant about their clothes: Done almost exclusively in army green and black, they relied on precise tailoring and clarity of vision rather than facile gimmickry. There were diagonal gathered tops, asymmetric trousers with only one full-cut leg, a couple of signature Bruce leather bomber jackets and a modern military coat with a zipper on the side. The sensational draped asymmetric dress that Devon wore proved that directional design can be perfectly wearable. And, to top it all off, this season Noselli and Gutierrez added a few men's looks to the mix.</p><p>Now that several independent-minded talents like Miguel Adrover and Daryl K have been recognized by investors, it seems clear that Bruce should be next in line to receive the serious backing that they so clearly deserve.</p></div>"
20,spring,2001,s2001,burberry-prorsum,"There was not a tartan in sight at Burberry, the once-stuffy label that Roberto Menichetti has successfully revitalized over the past few seasons. The omission was a smart move, considering how much exposure the signature plaid has recently received, especially after Miguel Adrover and Russell Sage borrowed it last season for their own experiments.</p><p>Menichetti turned instead to cornflower blue, all shades of beige and muted greens. Hand-tailored leather jackets were tucked into paneled skirts with a double waistband; silk skirts and shirts looked clean and fresh without a button in sight. But some trousers, featuring a sporty stripe down the side, and a couple of casual tops bearing a ""BP"" logo (Burberry Prorsum, not British Petroleum) seemed out of place, as did the odd obi belts that cinched many looks.</p><p>In general the clothes were well-tailored and constructed, but the collection as a whole was somewhat confusing. When you consider that it was done by an Italian designer working with Eastern references for a traditional English house, it's not hard to imagine why.</p></div>"
21,spring,2001,s2001,cacharel,"The biggest venue at the Carrousel du Louvre was packed to capacity (and then some) for Cacharel's first runway show in 20 years. Now that traditional French labels are being infused with new blood left and right, the house is hoping that the newly appointed design team of Clements Ribeiro will help them move beyond Anaïs Anaïs.</p><p>Their first collection proved that there is certainly a future for the brand. Young girls should adore the pastoral red-and-blue prints, mint julep tops and leg-hugging trousers. Liberty-style florals looked modern when mixed with snazzy ginghams; boyish short-sleeved shirts provided a crisp alternative for clean-cut schoolgirls. The accessories should also be a hit with the teen set: High wedges with red checkered soles, contrasting sorbet pumps, wide floral belts and (mis)matching driving caps all looked great.</p></div>"
22,spring,2001,s2001,callaghan,"Callaghan’s show was the first ever in New York for the 35-year-old fashion house, and also served as the Stateside debut for its unofficial designer, Nicolas Ghesquière, of Balenciaga fame.</p><p>In his collection for Callaghan, Ghesquière wowed the audience with an innovative, brilliantly worked collection of gathered, tied, pleated and frayed silk dresses. The look was classical Greece by way of Princess Leia, with plenty of Bianca Jagger attitude thrown in for good measure. The references may have come from the past, but there was nothing retro about the collection.</p><p>Ghesquière’s main talent lies in his obsession with details and the precision with which he cuts every garment, creating perfect proportions. Dresses shimmied on the body with every turn; uneven, frayed hems on skirts looked violently chic and absolutely of the moment. No less impressive were a few patchwork suede looks—distressed, tattered and regal.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""komxe5""></div></div><p>As if to underscore the hipper-than-thou nature of the clothes, Ghesquière not only turned to the season’s requisite thick leather belts, but also used thin straps of colorful paillette cords. They were the perfect complement to the beaded lightning bolts that adorned several looks, a tongue-in-cheek embellishment that looked surprisingly right in this context.</p></div>"
23,spring,2001,s2001,calvin-klein-collection,"There was a sporty, ultra-casual feeling to Calvin Klein's Spring collection. Light iridescent silk V-necks, violet funnel-neck tops and microstripe jackets looked comfortable and ideal for a springtime country escapade. These looks were clearly geared toward younger customers, who will also appreciate Klein's simple graphic-block jersey dresses in contrasting colors like green tea, pale rose and cobalt, as well as his metalized leather ensembles, and a superfine suede dress with a matching, low-slung belt, which looked hip and sophisticated.</p><p>Klein's uncomplicated mood extended to evening, which consisted of delicate camisoles in silk tulle, glimmering satin and glacé jersey with vivid optical color panels.</p><p>Those who truly appreciate timeless, effortless dressing will find a consistent, wearable wardrobe at Calvin Klein, without having to bend backward in order to accommodate the trends of the nanosecond.</p></div>"
24,spring,2001,s2001,carolina-herrera,"It was a lighter, breezier and younger-than-usual collection for Carolina Herrera, who stayed true to her love for polished, delicate clothes but managed to infuse her looks with a lively and vibrant spirit.</p><p>For Herrera, Spring is all about showing off bronzed legs and nipped waists. Her flip skirts are sassy and full of movement, chopped right at the knee, in coral and tobacco geometric prints; dresses are cinched with thin leather belts or disco-inspired gold chain link. Sensible summer alternatives include one-step-dressing shirtdresses and rompers, slightly bloused and always belted. For more adventurous types, there are teeny shorts, off-the-shoulder suede blouses and even a skimpy sunflower leather strapless dress.</p><p>Evening consisted of long skirts and gowns with embroidered cuffs, waistbands and collars, as well as generously cut pleated trousers. But it was the day looks, simply styled and perfect for a confident woman, that worked best.</p></div>"
25,spring,2001,s2001,celine,"After his relaxed collection of classic American sportswear in New York, Michael Kors hit the nail on the head once again at Celine.</p><p>Kors' collection was inspired by visions of desert life, with rich safari and unstructured military themes. Vintage denim bombers and pale jeans, distressed leather trousers and officers' coats, suede sarongs and linen Sahara coats will be a welcome change for the ladies who donned last season's <em>Dynasty</em>-inspired collection. Naturally, Kors still provided the luxurious, highly refined basics his customers swear by: There was a sensational gold-leaf cashmere turtleneck, a sinful crocodile battle number and a divine bronzed wool military jacket. Kors also indulged in cashmere sweatpants and shirts which hadn't been done with such ease since Norma Kamali. Tortoise-print bikinis and safari dresses were also lighthearted and fun.</p><p>Kors' collection proved that you don't have to stage a revolution to make a point. His clothes spoke of a quiet, sophisticated luxury that is perfectly in tune with the moment.</p></div>"
26,spring,2001,s2001,cerruti,"Designer Peter Speliopoulos is on a mission to modernize Cerruti without sacrificing any of the brand's old-world sophistication—and this collection proves that he is up to the task.</p><p>While most designers have turned to eye-popping cocktail dressing for inspiration, Speliopoulos focused on simple yet impeccable basics like belted jacket dresses, sharply tailored pantsuits and masculine shirts. More feminine alternatives retained a classic spirit of polished chic: pale tangerine suede dresses looked sharp, as did military-inspired jackets with epaulettes. There was also a more playful series of looks featuring a trompe l'oeil black net overlay print.</p><p>For evening, Speliopoulos showed overlays (the real thing this time) over simple short dresses, as well as several beautifully worked skirts with straw floral insets—perfect for ladies with an arts-and-crafts penchant.</p></div>"
27,spring,2001,s2001,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan's shows are always an intellectual tour de force; this is certainly not a designer who strives to define the season's hemline or dictate what the new black is.</p><p>As usual, there were no obvious references in the show, which was held in an old studio where Alfred Hitchcock used to film. An orchestra played live as Chalayan showed a short film featuring computer-animated models whose dresses mysteriously shattered; real models followed, wearing spare topstitched suits that exposed a tailor's patterns, unfettered shifts with scribbles all around and sublimely pleated, voluminous skirts. A series of denim looks appeared clean and sober, as did an army-green miniskirt paired with a tab-collar jacket. Unexpected bursts of color included a coral pleated skirt and a sublime red print that showed up on several dresses.</p><p>Chalayan's dramatic finale tied up the masterful presentation, alluding to a theme that is often a leitmotif to his work: the impermanence of clothing. Six girls wafted onstage, three of them holding up tiny mallets, with which they proceeded to break to pieces their companions' paste dresses.</p></div>"
28,spring,2001,s2001,chloe,"<em>VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards</em> Designer of the Year 2000 Stella McCartney certainly did not disappoint her legions of fabulous young fans who rely on Chloé for the season’s hot new trends. But this season, in addition to delivering sexy new T-shirts and plunging bathing suits (with playful pineapple motifs), McCartney explored grown-up territory. Perhaps drawing inspiration from Schiaparelli’s inventive chic, McCartney worked graphic horse prints (borrowed from Stubbs and Géricault) into loosely structured diagonal-seam dresses and beautiful jackets with a softly draped triangle shoulder. Skirts were long and relaxed, perfect when paired with lightweight, flouncy off-the shoulder tops. Wide-brim hats and dainty pillboxes with a tulle overlay gave the look a touch of ’30s sophistication. More casual pieces included sexy jeans with zipper pockets and metallic horses galloping along the backside, and a T-shirt with strategically placed banana appliqués in the front and the words “Keep your bananas off my melons” in the back.</p><p>This was a very strong collection for McCartney, and one that confirms her considerable talent and potential as a major designer.</p></div>"
29,spring,2001,s2001,christian-dior,"Highbrow eyebrows were raised from the very beginning of John Galliano’s outrageous presentation for Dior, as a sexy blaring soundtrack introduced a cavalcade of tough babes in patchwork wrapped skirts, sequined, pinned and frayed jackets, rough leather belts, vice squad-defiant heels and pop-colored fishnet stockings.</p><p>Classic Galliano motifs—newspaper-print tops, recycled and reconfigured jeans, hard-core leather straps and zippered motorcycle jackets—were thrown together with new creations like a bag that evoked a classic ’50s car (complete with door-handle clasp), sporty blousons with racing stripes, a bright yellow life-vest jacket and ruffled, hooded windbreakers. A contest of camouflage, leopard- and leather-trimmed bikinis segued into an array of ravaged prom queens who had clearly had too many drinks (not to mention a pill or two or three) the night before. But even the vampiest gals need a touch of class, so Galliano signed several looks (including lace-front dresses that surreptitiously morphed into trousers) with Dior mementos from the past: Miss Dior, Dior, J'Adore and Diorissimo.</p><p>Destruction, reconstruction, punk, recycling, tiaras, sex, patchwork, saddles, logos, commerce, camouflage, street, diffusion, vintage cars…only Galliano could pull it off.</p></div>"
30,spring,2001,s2001,christian-lacroix,"It's a very good moment for Christian Lacroix, now that graphic colors, feminine dressing and '80s references are a constant on the catwalks. The designer seized the moment and delivered one of his strongest, most consistent collections in seasons.</p><p>Lacroix played up his masterful use of color with sexy patchwork strapless numbers and ""painting-print"" dresses with beaded insets, dangling chains and straps, and embroidered patches. Punky layered chiffons and muslins, ruffled, feathered and pleated, proved that Lacroix can move way beyond his signature pouf (he very cleverly avoided them altogether). For those who can't live without basic black, there were tight trousers with corkscrew tunics, deconstructed coat-dresses, and a sensational gold-chain embroidered black jacket that Malgosia wore. Lacroix also provided some of the best belts of the season: thick, eye-popping works of art with leather insets, chunky hardware and grommets.</p></div>"
31,spring,2001,s2001,clements-ribeiro,"If anyone had any doubts that the design team of Inacio Ribeiro and Suzanne Clements could move beyond dainty cashmere sweaters, this collection ought to dispel them. The couple's Spring show could be best described as sweet and vicious, pairing feminine, delicate looks with hard-edged, punk-inspired ensembles.</p><p>Draping and gathering, a key element this season, showed up on floral-printed dolman-sleeved tops and billowy, mercilessly short dresses. Blazers were sharply nipped and strong-shouldered, worn with black, unforgiving fitted trousers, eyelet-studded belts and vertiginous heels. Formerly innocent gingham prints were also given a makeover: a translucent, one-shoulder checker dress looked dangerously sexy. Even more overtly brazen looks included a rugby shirt with a black bikini bottom and several mesh tops that left practically nothing to the imagination.</p><p>The collection was certainly a daring one for Clements Ribeiro, and in less capable hands it may have veered toward the vulgar. As it turned out, it was a success.</p></div>"
32,spring,2001,s2001,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo’s work in the early aughts is marked by its graphic impact, and her Spring 2001 collection is a case in point. Titled Optical Shock, it mixed camouflage with dizzying Op Art patterns and florals, and see-through jeans with fantastical millinery made with materials like plastic bags, bubble wrap, tinfoil, and caution tape. The designer seemed to be cultivating a sense of conscious chaos throughout.</p><p>While walking a narrow runway in a cramped space, models with scotch-taped faces were set on a near collision course with the audience. Despite the general cacophony, Kawakubo seemed less concerned with arousing anarchy than with waking us all up. We were left with a sense that the center <em>will</em> hold, secured by clear tape.</p></div>"
33,spring,2001,s2001,costume-national,"Looking for a dainty, girly, embroidered little spring frock for that garden party with the in-laws next May? Forget about it: You won't come even close to finding something like that at Costume National.</p><p>Designer Ennio Capasa went for his usual lean, mean and sleek silhouette. Masculine tuxedos were the inspiration for sexy pantsuits with wide cummerbunds, many with the jacket tucked inside the pants, some with glittering barely-there pinstripes. The black-and-white procession of bustiers, blazers and pegged trousers was only momentarily interrupted by several chocolate- brown suedes and leathers, as well as some violet-blue satins.</p><p>The look at Costume National was certainly consistent, but at some point everything tended to blur together; one would've liked to see more ideas at play.</p></div>"
34,spring,2001,s2001,cynthia-rowley,"Birds in cages hung in a long line above the runway at Cynthia Rowley as tribute to its birds and bees theme. The show was, however, as much about sex as <em>Happy Days</em> or <em>Grease</em>. What the audience saw instead was a study in 1950s American sportswear looks, silhouettes and personas.</p><p>For good girls there were a variety of full-skirted dresses nipped at the waist in both eyelet and honeycomb knit, tops with dainty details like smocking, ""bird watching"" dresses (some made from a bird print fabric) and boxy granny-style outerwear. Bad girls could take their pick of bomber jackets, hand-painted leather separates and a few scruffy boys also dressed by Rowley. The most successful bad-girl pieces were dolman-sleeved tops and dresses that fell off the shoulder.</p><p>The show was punctuated throughout with shots of neon: from the models' eye shadow to shoes with neon straps or heels and soles by Zeitgeist for Rowley. It closed with an anomalous series of dresses, many made of fluorescent string.</p></div>"
35,spring,2001,s2001,d-g,"Gold-covered couches, bottles of champagne and vodka, a row of disco balls, and a heart-shaped neon ""Love"" sign set the tone for D&amp;G's no-holds-barred joyride through a good-time girl's eclectic wardrobe.</p><p>To the tune of Madonna's hit single ""Music"", a procession of skintight nylon jersey strapless dresses, cropped motorcycle jackets and massive feather chubbies emerged. This collection was about fun, sex and money, and D&amp;G girls had no qualms about flaunting their riches. Glittery embroidery spelled out ""Diva,"" ""Expensive Doll"" and ""Because I'm Worth It"" on tops; dollar bills showed up on bikinis and sweeping chiffon dresses. Gold ruched skirts, leopard-print everything, and gigantic, colorful bows on evening dresses, tops and a miniskirt the size of a wide belt drove the point home.</p></div>"
36,spring,2001,s2001,daryl-k,"For years, Daryl K has been a cult favorite of downtown New Yorkers, who rely on her slim-fitting hiphuggers and comfy hooded sweatshirts as a sort of urban uniform. This season, Kerrigan's first with the newly formed conglomerate Pegasus Group, could mark her arrival as a fashion heavy hitter.</p><p>Kerrigan has always had a talent for mixing and matching street trends, and on this occasion she was at her best. Next Spring, young, trendy things will revel in her gold Lurex disco sweater dresses, so-sweet-yet-so-naughty sleeveless jersey tops, and sinfully scant running-shorts-inspired minis worn with hard-core mesh ankle booties. Other reworked '80s looks include a terry strapless dress, gold-chain-strap draped neck wrap tops, and gold mesh blousons accessorized with wide, low-slung leather belts.</p><p>Proving that she can creatively reinvent otherwise obvious references, Kerrigan showed a couple of brilliant canvas puff—not pouf—dresses with pleated tops and bunched skirts that owed more to Balenciaga than Lacroix. And, of course, there were also the trousers, the item that every (size 2) girl won't be able to live without: Daryl K's painted-on spinal pleat bootleg jeans in black, copper, and white canvas.</p></div>"
37,spring,2001,s2001,diane-von-furstenberg,"Thirty years after their launch, Diane von Furstenberg's vibrant, slinky numbers still look great at both the office and the disco. Today, Von Furstenberg's dresses are a hit with her devoted, old-school customers as well as with a new generation of girls who are discovering the allure of dressing like a woman.</p><p>Von Furstenberg's show, titled ""Hotel Life,"" featured plenty of her trusty wraps, in prints ranging from Playboy bunnies to airplanes (after two full seasons of logomania, the ""DVF"" logo print was less successful). For those days when silk jersey feels like a bit much, there was also a denim wrap, as well as pretty camisoles with ruffle detailing, no-nonsense cotton culottes and engine-red fitted trousers. In short, it was a collection full of breezy, easy-to-wear basics for a sexy, colorful spring.</p></div>"
38,spring,2001,s2001,dkny,"Donna Karan presented her secondary line at the Dia Center for the Arts, ushering groups of guests into the gallery space where models took to the catwalk every half-hour or so in what amounted to a revolving party.</p><p>Men's suiting was an important influence, as Karan showed oversize pinstripe blazers, stark masculine chemises, a billowy tan trench, and basic suits livened up with matte copper paillette tops.</p><p>A disheveled tulle skirt was paired with a strapless leather bustier—an unavoidable nod to the '80s. Young girls will love the shimmering hot pants and powder-blue beaded minidresses; the older crowd will stick with true-and-tried basics. Most of Karan's looks featured wide leather belts worn at the hip—a look that is already emerging as one of the key trends for the season.</p></div>"
39,spring,2001,s2001,dolce-gabbana,"With a backdrop of dainty, blossoming trees, strewn roses, lace curtains and a spanking-white little Topolino car, glitzy glamour met power-dressing at Dolce &amp; Gabbana.</p><p>Smart, fitted black suits brought to mind <em>Roman Holiday</em> chic when worn with impenetrable sunglasses. Strap-back bustiers, ""Addicted to Love"" body-hugging jersey dresses and sexy pencil skirts looked sharp and severe, as did the sheer black shirts. But those who rely on Dolce &amp; Gabbana for over-the-top glitter and shine will not be disappointed—there were plenty of beaded, ravaged jeans held together with safety pins, bold-colored leather motorcycle jackets, sequin-drenched shirts and colorfully printed, voluminous skirts. Die-hard fans who remember the designers' long-time relationship with the Material Girl will definitely want to collect the new series of kitschy, heavily beaded Madonna T-shirts.</p></div>"
40,spring,2001,s2001,donna-karan,"Donna Karan reworked familiar inspirations this season—Indochine glamour and Asian weaves with the steamy seduction of New York—to create a mix of tailored, constructed jackets and suits and featherweight layered chiffon dresses.</p><p>Her show opened with a series of caviar pinstriped pencil skirts, tailored jackets and cocoon coats perfect for Karan's working woman, who is always on the hunt for pared-down yet luxurious staples. Jersey tie-front dresses, layered over champagne slips, revealed a more playful side to her collection; the same can be said for her liquid satin looks, intended for after-five cocktails.</p><p>Karan's finale was the most eye-catching part of the show: tangerine, lilac and peach beaded gowns escalated into burnt sienna pleated numbers and finally climaxed with the stunning strapless flame orange organza dress with which Shalom Harlow closed the show.</p></div>"
41,spring,2001,s2001,elspeth-gibson,"""Come to the Cabaret, my friend"" was the title for Elspeth Gibson's show, a ""fusion of ultimate glamour fringed with masculine overtones,"" according to the program. Gibson set out on a quest to reclaim the spiky femininity of divas like Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford and Jerry Hall, but unfortunately did not have much luck with her endeavor.</p><p>Gibson is known for her subtle, delicate use of decoration, and she was clearly out of her element with the plunging necklines, paillette-covered pirate shirts and microscopic miniskirts that she showed. An embroidered bikini, a pleated miniskirt worn with a beaded jacket and a glittering tuxedo complete with top hat added to the confusion.</p><p>On the upside, some pieces, like the simple geometric-print dresses and optical halter tops and sweaters, will be a worthwhile addition to any closet. But as a whole, the sexy, edgy mood that Gibson tried to achieve simply was not there.</p></div>"
42,spring,2001,s2001,emilio-pucci,"Having been recently acquired by LVMH, we can expect Pucci to develop a higher profile in the near future. The opening of a new flagship store in Milan is a clear indication that the once-ubiquitous label is poised for a revival.</p><p>Fans of Pucci's signature arabesques won't be disappointed—there were plenty of optical swirls in shades of bright lime, gray, and coral. More subtle interpretations included black-and-white damask silk looks textured with tone-on-tone prints. Shapes were for the most part reminiscent of the '60s—there were collarless coats with cropped sleeves, flashy miniskirts and skimpy shorts.</p><p>Still, it's unclear which direction the house will take in the future; the collection certainly upheld the spirit of Pucci, but there weren't any dramatic innovations.</p></div>"
43,spring,2001,s2001,emporio-armani,"There were no surprises at Emporio Armani today—feminine shapes, muted grays, khakis and blues and a very flirty attitude ruled the runway. The pantsuit was a key look, particularly single-breasted, narrow jackets and wide, low-slung trousers that ended just above the ankle with an uneven hem. Feather-light day dresses, worn with sun hats, scarf-blouses with knee-length skirts, and double-layered slips are perfect summer garden-party attire.</p><p>Armani kept the mood simple for evening, sprinkling strapless, one-shouldered or spaghetti-strap dresses with silver beads. Three gelatto-colored miniskirts with matching transparent shirts closed the show.</p></div>"
44,spring,2001,s2001,eric-bergere,"""From Bahia to St. Louis"" was the inspiration for Eric Bergère's midnight blue, rust, khaki and white collection that spanned a considerable range of influences and moods.</p><p>The general look was clearly inspired by the '80s: Lacquered linen pants, miniskirts and trenches had the appearance of leather; T-shirt dresses were dressed up with one-shouldered grommets and leather appliqués. A desert motif ensued, featuring cotton toile tunics, blousons and vests. For evening there were billowing harem pants, jersey tops with gold paillettes and muslin floor-length robes.</p><p>Bergère clearly has a talent for creating sexy, wearable clothes, yet the collection felt uneven at times, as if unsure of which direction to fully explore.</p></div>"
45,spring,2001,s2001,fendi,"Gone are the days when punk was synonymous with grungy streets and economic hardship—Karl Lagerfeld showed that metal spikes, black lipstick and hard-core leathers are perfectly proper sartorial alternatives nowadays.</p><p>Fendi women will replace fall's candy-colored furs with black zip-up biker jackets, aggressively ruched one-shoulder tops and draped, shiny dresses in body-hugging jerseys. The look is strong and powerful—leather minidresses slashed way above the knee, gathered billowy tops and voluminous, asymmetrical skirts. Dangerous-looking accessories include gold weightlifter belts, thick neck cuffs, spiked shoulder straps from which to hang a gilded purse, and stilettos dazzling with gold chain link.</p><p>Now that Lagerfeld has delivered a luxurious, highly stylized interpretation of haute punk, it's official that this will be a key style next spring.</p></div>"
46,spring,2001,s2001,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré took his architectural, highly stylized vision of fashion to Africa this season while staying true to the couture-like attention to detail, craftsmanship and fabrics that characterize his work.</p><p>Traditional tribal garments became the starting point for flights of fancy that included python-strip skirts, straw corset-dresses, shantung skirts sculpted into liquorice cones and a stunning micro dress made exclusively of red coral beads. For the less adventurous there were oversized white masculine shirts deconstructed into sexy chemises, floor-length gowns with a slight train and tailored suits with balloon sleeves.</p><p>Clearly, these are not the most practical of clothes. But if you're looking for an intricately constructed, show-stopping dress that will not likely be forgotten, Ferré could be the perfect choice.</p></div>"
47,spring,2001,s2001,giorgio-armani,"With a major retrospective of his work this fall and the opening of his massive new Milan store tonight, there was certainly no shortage of megawatt celebrities at Armani's presentation today. Sarah Ferguson, Phil Collins, Sophia Loren and Robert De Niro all stopped by to pay tribute to one of the most important designers of the past 30 years.</p><p>Armani's women—all brunettes this time around—had a coquettish, gamine charm to them, wearing masculine pinstriped trousers with suspenders, relaxed jackets and sleeveless silk T-shirts. Ultra-light lace dresses were adorned with faint, leafy patterns on a sheer background; honey leather jackets, cropped and unlined, gave the look a stronger edge. Eveningwear revolved around backless, beaded and knotted tops, paired with shimmering, crystal-embroidered pants or short, frilly skirts.</p></div>"
48,spring,2001,s2001,givenchy,"Alexander McQueen is going through a particularly good moment: After hosting an exquisite couture party for Givenchy last summer and delivering a breathtaking show for his signature line in London two weeks ago, he presented today a tempered, well-thought-out collection for Givenchy ready-to-wear.</p><p>Teddy boys, rockabilly and David Bowie were all sources of inspiration for McQueen. Skirts with massive confections of pleats, ruffles and crinolines were worn with massive corset-belts, sharp jackets and crisp short-sleeved shirts—perfect for a Sunday sundae at the fashion wonderland drive-in. There were also long, mannish pinstriped overcoats, sheer shirts with gathered panel fronts and several lingerie-inspired looks. Dazzling apple-green and red- checkered coats, spectator pumps and pegged houndstooth trousers were visually arresting, but more traditional Givenchy customers will go for the chocolate suede bombers, fitted pencil skirts and tortoiseshell-print dresses.</p></div>"
49,spring,2001,s2001,gucci,"Sex is in the air for spring 2001, and Tom Ford has always known how to work the sleek, lean look better than anyone else. But for all the raciness of his collection, it seems that this time around Gucci is undergoing somewhat of an identity crisis.</p><p>Black-and-white dominatrix-inspired looks opened the show, featuring corseted waists, rigid bustiers, and stiletto-heel shoe-boots. Massive purple satin suits alternated with safari jackets and extra-wide cargo pants; a wet T-shirt contest of manipulated, skimpy tank tops gave way to military-inspired jackets and trousers. There was also an immense dolman top, a short cape and a bat-sleeved, rubberized trenchcoat.</p><p>With fashion’s decade-jumping game moving at breakneck speed, Alaïa, Saint Laurent, Mugler, Gaultier and even Dolce &amp; Gabbana are all viable references. But are we prepared for a deflated pouf skirt with a huge cargo pocket? Cross-your-heart brassiere tops? What worked best at Gucci were the clothes that didn’t make an effort, like the straight satin trousers, ribbed tops and short, pleated dresses.</p></div>"
50,spring,2001,s2001,halston,"Craig Natiello is in the difficult position of designing for a house that bears another's name—especially since the name is that of an unparalleled icon of American design, Roy Halston Frowick. In this collection, Natiello worked with classic Halston fabrics and colors, including Ultrasuede, cashmere, beaded chiffons and Halston's signature red. But beaded warmup suits and disco music were unable to recall the glory of the Halston/Studio 54 era. Although much of the collection felt like Halston-lite, an ivory Ultrasuede shirtdress and a red cashmere scarf top paired with a red skirt struck the right balance between old and new.</p></div>"
51,spring,2001,s2001,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang's show began innocently enough, his trademark sleek trousers, body-conscious tops and functional overcoats redone for Spring in nubby silk-knit burlap. The looks were pure Helmut: functional, urban and modern. But then, gradually, a wave of sexual innuendo began to escalate. A tape-like strap was strategically placed on a semitransparent top; a bikini bottom was paired with a deep-plunging tank. Finally, a procession of crisscrossed, bondage-inspired dresses and tops whizzed through the audience. Lang, the designer who pioneered androgynous, uniform dressing, had designed a brilliant collection that could go from a Tribeca loft cocktail party to an alleyway midnight rendezvous west of Times Square.</p><p>Many of Lang's I-didn't-mean-to-turn-you-on minidresses referenced Azzedine Alaïa, whose influence can be seen just about everywhere these days. But, as always, Lang made the look his own. Slim trousers featured circular cutouts on the side; leather coats and dresses were perversely punched with holes, giving them an intimidating, gothic feel. Not quite ready to walk into the office wearing full-on dominatrix garb? Not to worry—you'll still find plenty of Lang's reliable basics to choose from.</p></div>"
52,spring,2001,s2001,hermes,"Sportswear has always been the core of clothing collections at Hermès, which was responsible, among other pieces, for the zippered leather golf jacket worn by the stylish Duke of Windsor. For Spring, Martin Margiela showed aviator and nautical looks that owed a small debt to the duke’s natty ways. The designer also introduced the trikini, a transformable three-part garment suitable for the beach and the street. On the runway, it was paired with pants.</p><p>Covered-up describes most of Margiela’s work for Hermès, but this collection had several skin-baring moments. Two models topped their tomboy trousers with striped lengths of silk hung around the neck, crossed in front over each breast, and tied at the back.</p></div>"
53,spring,2001,s2001,imitation-of-christ,"Designers Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave of Imitation of Christ claim to have a bilious distaste for organized fashion, but, for a couple of newcomers, they certainly seem tuned in to how the system works. In just one season, the duo has managed to garner an unprecedented amount of interest—thanks in part, no doubt, to high-profile celebrity friends like Chloë Sevigny and Natasha Lyonne. But Imitation of Christ also knows that in fashion performance is often as important as the clothes themselves.</p><p>For their first show, Subkoff and Damhave took over an East Village funeral parlor—complete with casket—and sent down the makeshift runway 51 dramatically clad mourners. To the plaintive tune of The Smiths’ “Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me,” a brokenhearted wife, orphaned children, assorted relatives, military heroes, and a mistress or two paid their respects wearing extraordinarily ruffled and pleated dresses, tattered uniforms and revamped thrift-store suits.</p><p>Subkoff and Damhave understand that true originality is found in unexpected places. By recycling, customizing and updating discarded clothing, the pair makes what is old new again—and the results are fresher than the self-conscious retro looks established designers often propose after cannibalizing fashion archives in search of inspiration.</p></div>"
54,spring,2001,s2001,jean-paul-gaultier,"Skulls, bats and infernal flames on Jean Paul Gaultier's invitation hinted at what was to come at his show: hordes of rough and tough Hell's Angels, biker chicks and <em>Mad Max</em> warriors. The stage was set with a dirt field in lieu of a runway and gigantic speakers blaring hard rock as a procession of gum-chewing, beer-guzzling babes in combat boots, fringed tops and airbrushed, slashed dresses appeared. Pieces of leather motorcycle jackets and pants—an arm here, half a trouser there—were tied over bunched and gathered skirts. The look was relentlessly hard—so much that at times the styling overpowered the clothes. Nonetheless, under all the madness there were plenty of wearable clothes, like a gorgeous pleated lavender skirt, colorfully printed shirts, leather miniskirts and layered tanks.</p><p>Gaultier's collection delivered two key trends for spring: short, playful yet hard-edged dresses and skirts, and aggressive biker-inspired leathers.</p></div>"
55,spring,2001,s2001,jeremy-scott,"Thank God for Jeremy Scott, a designer who knows that fashion is, first and foremost, about having fun. Paris' Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie was transformed into a gigantic suburban mall complete with winding staircase and multihued fountains—the perfect setting for the final collection of the season.</p><p>Scott showed sharp little suits, day dresses and shorts in a black-and-white print which, upon closer inspection, proved to be tiny sketches of his past designs. Yellow, purple and pale blue combos followed, as well as simple jersey dresses with a (paste) jewelry motif. The look was high glamour by way of the Sears catalog—and those familiar with Scott's work will understand that this is quite a compliment. For the grand finale Scott staged a ravishing old-school beauty pageant that was part Barbie, My Little Pony and Miss Colombia. His contestants, ravishing in Nagel makeup and curly manes, wore beaded pastel sea-shell bathing suits as Scott read out their measurements over Phil Collins' <em>Against All Odds</em> soundtrack. Who could ask for anything more?</p></div>"
56,spring,2001,s2001,jil-sander,"There was great expectation surrounding the Jil Sander show, considering that it was the first Sander collection since the German designer parted ways with the Prada Group, which owns the label.</p><p>The creative team who took over the brand clearly sought to adhere to Sander's essential dictums of clean shapes and simple design. The silhouette was definitely Sander—belted trenches, essential white shirts and unfettered shirtdresses looked perfectly proper, as did the classic light turtlenecks, now with a more ample armhole, and wearable pantsuits. Less accomplished were the high-waist trousers and skirts, which seemed cumbersome at times, especially with jackets tucked inside.</p><p>The collection's overcast, gray color scheme did not help matters. What was missing most was Sander's inimitable lightness of touch, which simply cannot be duplicated, no matter how vast the archives she left behind may be.</p></div>"
57,spring,2001,s2001,john-bartlett,"A wall of nearly naked, whitewashed men served as the backdrop for John Bartlett's runway show, which updated last season's leitmotif of ladylike dressing with a freer, less rigid approach. Kimono shapes have always been important to Bartlett, and in this case they showed up on silk jersey and cotton crepe sleeveless tops, sexy chiffon dresses and even on a ""reverse"" iron-gray suede dress that Alek Wek wore. There were also several well-cut trousers and a couple of perfect white shirts, as well as a striking wool smoking and a sleeveless, asymmetric talcum-colored leather shift.</p><p>The liner notes for Bartlett's show explained that rope was his inspiration this season—""erotic, sacred, tightening the knot that frees our duality."" Indeed, many looks were accessorized with cords, ranging from a military-inspired sash on Shalom, to a golden knot peeking out from under Angela Lindvall's black jacket. But, ultimately, it was unclear what exactly Bartlett sought to convey—the clothes were cleverly styled, but lacked a powerful message.</p></div>"
58,spring,2001,s2001,john-galliano,"Just when you thought no one could pull the fashion crowd’s leg, along comes John Galliano to stir up a storm. His presentation took place in the same venue as Dior, and <em>CD</em> logos shone bright as puzzled editors took their places. The lights dimmed, and the same aggressive and raunchy soundtrack from Dior introduced…several of the exact same Dior looks. As the music appropriately segued to Britney Spears’ “Oops!…I did It Again,” Galliano’s signature collection followed—not that it was much different from the one he showed two days ago for Dior.</p><p>Like a child playing in an insane asylum turned atelier, Galliano sent out girls in reconfigured, violated dresses with cartoony oversize zippers and giant snaps; his controversial ladies sans domicile fixe were also there, as well as new belles with massive feathered hats and tattered umbrellas. Dior’s beauty queens in bathing suits were replaced by their punk cousins, with slogans like “We live a class war” and “I wanna see some men” stamped on a derrière or two.</p><p>Some might say that Galliano’s prank collection was a bit too much—but, one could argue, it was too much of a good thing.</p></div>"
59,spring,2001,s2001,kenzo,"Gilles Rosier's collection for Kenzo was based on a play between lightness and geometry. Fluid chiffon dresses were dip-dyed and layered, chiffon ones smocked and ruffled, while harder chocolate leather skirts were embellished with graphic circular orange insets. Rosier also delivered several unpretentious, girly white dresses, trousers and wrap tops that will be perfect for a day at the beach: Throw them over one of his siren-inspired bathing suits.</p><p>Rosier is still on his way to modernizing Kenzo's considerable legacy of mixing and matching diverse cultural references. There were plenty of good pieces in the collection, but many of them got lost in a sea of repetition. The show would've gained strength if it had been edited down to the essential looks.</p></div>"
60,spring,2001,s2001,lanvin,"Lanvin designer Cristina Ortiz reworked the season's loose, sexy silhouette in a simple palette of white, tan, black, pink and red. Billowy short dresses, paillette-trimmed off-the-shoulder blouson tops and tab-collar shirts with keyhole cutouts played up the current cocktail-dressing motif. Beaded bell tops were paired with fitted knee-length skirts, and simple pantsuits were worn with masculine shirts.</p><p>Ortiz's designs were in tune with the fashion moment, but parts of her collection seemed overly derivative. The studded skirts and dresses with a woman's face on them brought to mind Chloé's embroidered looks; the diamente plunging bodysuits and the edging on white trousers were at times reminiscent of Loewe. Ortiz's collection was well cut, but the house of Lanvin has yet to develop a strong personal identity under her creative direction.</p></div>"
61,spring,2001,s2001,lawrence-steele,"It was a very focused collection for Lawrence Steele—so focused, in fact, that it was limited to only three colors.</p><p>Appropriating key elements of black-tie dress-up, Steele sent out a procession of demimondaines clad in black tuxedo-inspired pantsuits with white lining; white shirts and cheeky bow ties; white satin halter-top dresses suspended from a black tie; and white pencil skirts with simple black turtlenecks.</p><p>To break the bichromatic spell, Steele turned to Ferrari-red patent-leather coats, sequined ties and piping on immaculate coats, as well as marabou-sleeved evening dresses and a show-stealing feather coat. The shoes? Black Manolo Blahnik stilettos with a crimson sole, of course.</p></div>"
62,spring,2001,s2001,lizzy-disney,"British designer Lizzy Disney graduated in 1995 from Central Saint Martins College with a degree in fashion design and marketing. After working in New York, she returned to London where she launched her hugely successful accessories collection—called Lizzy Disney—from which her clothing line grew. With their soft draping and poise, Disney's designs, such as her off-the-shoulder lilac dress and her final number, a dramatic black dress with a fall-way sleeve, belie their complex execution.</p></div>"
63,spring,2001,s2001,loewe,"Quiet, understated luxury is Narciso Rodriguez's forte, so women who are not interested in fickle clothes that come and go every few months will feel at home with Loewe this season.</p><p>The twisted shapes that have dominated other collections were nowhere to be found here; instead, Rodriguez opted for clean-shaped blazers, shirt dresses and leather skirts with gently gathered waistbands. Suede T-shirts, kimonos and camisoles felt as light as the ecru linen wrap tops and jersey dresses; wide leather belts and hard silver cases with red or black enamel stripes gave the looks an edgier feeling.</p><p>For evening, Rodriguez kept it simple with beaded geometric dresses in bone, black and red. Aside from a couple of long, shimmering skirts, the look was short, uncomplicated and sexy.</p></div>"
64,spring,2001,s2001,louis-vuitton,"Never mind that Marc Jacobs designs four full collections a year in addition to his recently launched secondary line. With Louis Vuitton, he proved once again that he has plenty of talent to spare, and no signs of slowing down. Normally, one can be happy if a designer proposes one solid trend per season. But that would never satisfy Jacobs; instead, he whipped up and reworked several of the season's recurring motifs in completely novel ways. Uniforms, a clear influence on the Spring collections, were referenced through khaki and olive-green military blousons with epaulettes, snap-side skirts, policeman hats, an ""SS Vuitton"" naval cap and a genial camouflage rose print. Pining for fluorescent colors rather that six months in the army? Jacobs took the day-glo trend from street to chic with impeccable hot pink and neon green V-neck sweaters. Fifties met '80s punk with pleated, low-slung skirts with folded waistbands and clear plastic bands to pinch the silhouette.</p><p>Accessories? Hardly two pairs of shoes were the same: There were fluoro pumps, casual flats and sexy kitten heels to choose from. And just when you thought you couldn't stand another logo, Jacobs found the perfect compromise between art and commerce: Stephen Sprouse graffiti-painted ""Louis Vuitton"" on the house's brand-new totes.</p></div>"
65,spring,2001,s2001,luella,"Ex-British <em>Vogue</em> writer Luella Bartley has become the darling of London's new generation of ""It"" girls, so it's no surprise she snapped up models Kate Moss, Malgosia, and Frankie and Missy Rayder for her runway ode to the '80s.</p><p>Backed by an upbeat Go-Go's soundtrack, Luella offered graffiti-printed denim suits, skirts and bathing suits; and leather sleeveless tops and tube dresses trimmed with fluorescent stretch knit bands. There were also strong-shouldered motorcycle jackets, glittering pantsuits and a white tuxedo with white lapels. A seemingly innocent print revealed itself to be, upon closer inspection, a skull with the number ""87"" inscribed on its bony forehead. Liquid Sky-inspired streaks of neon over the eyes finished off the look.</p><p>It's clear that the '80s are a major influence this season, and Luella certainly capitalized on the trend. But, while her show was poppy, well-styled and undoubtedly fun, it was also too literal. Claude Montana, an obvious source of inspiration, should have been Luella's guest of honor.</p></div>"
66,spring,2001,s2001,maison-martin-margiela,"Margiela once turned socks into a sweater and gloves into a purse. For Spring ’01, he went with gloves again, this time turning them into a witty vest that might just have inspired <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/fashion-week-review/12034897/jacquemus-fall-2015-rtw/"">Simon Porte Jacquemus’s Fall ’15 show</a>. Notable, too, were the man-tailored pieces presented by models moving around a petal-strewn floor at the Louvre.</p></div>"
67,spring,2001,s2001,marc-jacobs,"It was a treat to see Marc Jacobs having a blast with his signature line, which cheekily referenced his early so-hip-it-hurts Danceteria days.</p><p>To a blaring soundtrack, a gaggle of giddy, '80s-inspired homecoming queens strutted their stuff: ruched jersey drawstring tops with punky poplin skirts, wide belts with studs and pastel appliqués, twill baggy shorts, and mile-high mesh stilettos. One-shoulder striped tees in fuchsia and black, which could have been worn by Pat Benatar circa '83, looked fresh once again; leather bustiers and jackets with bright piping and pastel shell-shaped appliqués were campy, lighthearted and fun.</p><p>Then again, if you already lived firsthand through the stylistic excesses of the early to mid-'80s, you may not be ready for a full-blown Fiorucci revival. Relax, you need not hunt for your collection of neon bows and gummy bracelets. Look past the Valley Girl styling and you'll discover plenty of wearable, grown-up pieces in Jacobs' collection, like sharply cut cotton trousers, double-layered skirts and a beautiful canary-yellow silk paper taffeta dress. A flocked-tulle confabulation could be worn with equal ease by a daring prom queen or a fashion-savvy girl-about-town.</p></div>"
68,spring,2001,s2001,marjan-pejoski,"Marjan Pejoski's game-inspired presentation left no doubt that unbridled creativity is alive and well in London. A group of children cleverly disguised as a tulle chess set opened the show, their costumes blurring as they spun about madly on a checkerboard floor.</p><p>A set of Vegas ladies of leisure followed, appropriately clad in draped jersey dresses with rhinestone accents and bejeweled cartoon characters that were simultaneously endearing and wickedly lascivious (Minnie and Mickey were far too close for comfort on a billowing top, and Felix the Cat seemed too at ease on a tiny bikini). Several net dresses that left nothing to the imagination and a strategically placed bunny-ear top were also part of the madness. The tamer pieces of a highly original collection were denim skirts and jeans with playing-card stitching on the back pockets, slinky pegged trousers, and a baseball jacket with gold sleeves and a plunging neckline.</p></div>"
69,spring,2001,s2001,markus-lupfer,"Marcus Lupfer's spunky Spring collection was all '50s rockabilly by way of the '80s. His street-tough vixens wore everything from a sensational one-strapped leather minidress with a ruched circular side seam to knit leather vests and strip-cut skirts. Plaid blazers gathered in back and tied in front with an internal leather cord looked tough and fabulous with slightly pegged trousers. Bouncy, '50s-inspired skirts to the knee, flirty dresses with draped backs and a red plaid shift with a tulle overlay provided a softer counterpoint.</p><p>For many, London fashion week is the place to discover fresh new talent. This collection, which successfully balances edgy creativity with plenty of precision and restraint, puts Lupfer in a good position to gain the recognition he deserves.</p></div>"
70,spring,2001,s2001,marni,"Marni's well-turned-out girly looks provided a welcome respite from the '80s-inspired fashions that have dominated the season so far. From the clean-cut topstitched overcoats to the breezy shirts and comfortable country skirts, designer Consuelo Castiglione delivered wearable, perfectly chic clothes.</p><p>Seersucker stripes, delicate embroidery and optical prints were all mixed and matched to great advantage; '50s-style skirts, full and layered, looked new with graphically colored two-tone spectator pumps. Boot-cut pants, a black ruched short jacket and an asymmetrical handkerchief top gave the collection a modern edge. For evening there was a striking boat-neck sequined top, pleated wrap skirts and a couple of light sheared furs.</p></div>"
71,spring,2001,s2001,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon worked plenty of ideas into her presentation, all alluding to a tough, modern woman. A black coat with pen-scratch print opened the show, followed by spray-painted dresses, leather jackets with side-zips, and a tuxedo coat and pants with a simple black shirt. A gleaming red leather coat introduced rosy overlay printed dresses, many with iridescent prints and full layered skirts. A procession of rhinestone-accented black dresses and one-shouldered, deconstructed, manipulated mini evening pieces closed the show.</p><p>Sitbon certainly created some good looks, but the collection as a whole proved to be long and repetitive, and would've benefited considerably from strict editing.</p></div>"
72,spring,2001,s2001,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson called his collection ""Candy Girls,"" and indeed it seemed like his models dressed up while in the throes of a delightfully giddy sugar rush. A pastel cotton stripy dress with a boa of ribbons twirling around it was just the beginning—not a single dull look followed.</p><p>Williamson divided his show by groups: Pink, blue and yellow shirts with beaded skirts; turquoise, olive and fuchsia cowl-neck dresses; and a series of aqua-and-navy camouflage camisoles that were more op-art than combat all looked fun and lively. Accessories included thick utility belts, some with a shoulder strap (perfect for lip gloss and cigarettes in place of live ammunition), and contrasting stockings in fluorescent colors that drove the girly message home.</p><p>The spirit of careless frivolity continued onto the evening pieces, which included everything from a tiny olive miniskirt worn with a military jacket and a ruby medal to flamenco-inspired ruffle dresses. And what better shoes to finish the look than Manolo Blahnik two-tone spikes in rainbow colors?</p></div>"
73,spring,2001,s2001,michael-kors-collection,"Kudos to Michael Kors, who presented a strong, easy-to-wear collection that reconfirmed his status as a modern master of practical American sportswear.</p><p>Fashion icons Lauren Hutton, Ali MacGraw and Martha Graham were important references for Kors, their relaxed style reinterpreted in earthy jersey ballet dresses, inviting cashmere hand-knit sweaters and a sensational muslin beaded embroidered skirt. True to his love for ultra-luxurious materials, Kors also showed a divine barley suede off-the-shoulder shift, several light shearling jackets, and a mink-backed suede serape to ward off chilly April breezes. The obligatory beige trench came in double-faced cotton, washed and oversized—creating a loose, comfortable silhouette that was anchored down with low-slung leather belts.</p><p>In contrast to last season's somewhat uptight evening looks, Kors closed his Spring show with a couple of absolutely brilliant—and perfectly simple—black stretch jersey gowns that brought to mind the best of the Halston era.</p></div>"
74,spring,2001,s2001,miguel-adrover,"Spanish designer Miguel Adrover’s Spring 2001 collection proved that he is one of the most creative and insightful talents in his field. An impeccable navy suit and cream blouse with matching navy trim set the tone for the show, providing the perfect prelude to a series of polished looks. Featuring comfortable blazers with straight-legged trousers, masculine shirts and casual polos, Adrover brought to mind a Pimm’s-and-lemonade-sipping debutante enjoying the good life in Bermuda. But his archetypal woman has many faces: Interspersed among his parade of proper uptown ladies were ghetto-fabulous home girls with bandannas and cutoff shirts, Army cadets in strict olive-green uniforms and streetwise chicks in distressed jeans. Shockingly, they all blended in seamlessly, forming a chic procession of mix-and-match style tribes.</p><p>The key to Adrover’s success lies in his ability to appropriate diverse cultural elements to create something utterly new. While most native New Yorkers develop early on a talent for deciphering stereotypes and social codes, Adrover knows that, sometimes, it is the foreigners who ultimately get it right.</p></div>"
75,spring,2001,s2001,missoni,"It was a rich woman's world at Missoni—sensuous fabrics, graphic prints piled atop each other, huge M-shaped bangles dangling on wrists and retro movie-star-inspired shades.</p><p>Missoni's ""Modern Eccentric"" wore liquid, fluid crepe, satin and jersey dresses with stiff, wide cummerbunds and double-buckle belts; for evening, beaded pants were as tight as leggings; a Lurex-knit, off-the-shoulder silver top with large ruffles lent a bit of necessary lightness to the often overwhelming looks. For hot summer days there were large tote bags, beach towels, plunging swimsuits and even robes, all decorated with signature Missoni prints. If anyone wants to flaunt a rich, overtly decadent lifestyle to the max, this is the place to turn to.</p></div>"
76,spring,2001,s2001,miu-miu,"The '50s-by-way-of-the-'80s spirit that Miuccia Prada referenced in her signature line also turned up at Miu Miu, here with a young, utilitarian spin.</p><p>The collection opened with short skirts that were dwarfed by oversize drop-shoulder jackets cinched at the waist with wide elastic belts; there were large exterior pockets on cropped tops, skirts and jackets. Striped mohair sweaters looked smart with a pleated full skirt to the knee; pointy librarian glasses accentuated the '50s collegiate look. Lighter pieces included a semi-sheer white camisole with spaghetti straps, an Empire-waist gray shift, and several printed and pleated baby-doll dresses.</p><p>The accessories also picked up on the themes seen at Prada. Geometric color-block pumps conveyed a girly and playful spirit, while the wide-strapped bags brought to mind the need for urban, no-nonsense essentials.</p></div>"
77,spring,2001,s2001,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez's appeal lies in the restraint of his designs and in the luxurious, quiet materials he employs, and his Spring collection of well-cut, understated everyday basics was no exception. A sleeveless washed suede dress, for example, looked as if it could be worn straight out of bed; cotton poplin jackets with wide sleeves over shorts looked casual and relaxed; airy, masculine white shirts looked great with pleated trousers or a silver beaded skirt for extra lift. Other standouts included a coral silk crepe dress with a partial gather at the waistline, a double-face khaki silk trench, and a white leather and sequin off-the-shoulder top.</p><p>Although the collection was perfectly chic and wearable, one can't help but wish that Rodriguez would take a leap and use his considerable talent to experiment with more adventurous ideas.</p></div>"
78,spring,2001,s2001,nicole-miller,"Cyndi Lauper's front-row presence at Nicole Miller's presentation was a harbinger of the '80s-inspired collection that followed. Wearing glitter socks with strappy metallic sandals, the models walked the runway in a dazzling array of iridescent Lurex pieces, gold denim and sequined prints. There were also matte jersey blouson and wrap dresses and, of course, a variety of prints, a Miller specialty.</p><p>Gold chains with large hanging pendants, made by Erickson Beamon for Nicole Miller, were creatively worn as necklaces, belts and even dress straps. Leather hip belts, also gold, were equally effective. ""Roller-girl glam rock—but modern"" are the words Coleman (Miller's music man) used to describe the show's sound, and they work just as well to characterize Miller's collection.</p></div>"
79,spring,2001,s2001,olivier-theyskens,"Belgians might not be familiar with the Morton Salt Girl, but they know very well the iconic yellow cire raincoat that inspired this collection. Olivier Theyskens came up with the idea of translating it into leather and from there he became swept up in a maritime theme that extended even to the set: models walked on mussel shells in shoes covered in black sand. Belgian shrimp farmers, safety boats, and life preservers were all worked into this collection, which the designer describes as all “an ode to the Belgian seaside.”</p><p>Clicking through the looks, what jumps out is how Theyskens, who was known for his dark Romanticism, applied athletic and utilitarian touches throughout his ship-shape line-up.</p></div>"
80,spring,2001,s2001,oscar-de-la-renta,"Oscar de la Renta never strays far from his signature brand of elegance, but this time around his collection felt lighter and breezier than usual. His well-established clientele will certainly go for classic favorites like the playful silk crystal pleated skirts to the knee, worn with preppy navy cashmere sweaters. Or the day dress—a summer essential—which came in a variety of styles including a chartreuse linen shift, plenty of sexy jacquard silk halters and the all-important little black number.</p><p>But for many, evening is what de la Renta does best, and they will not be disappointed. Alek Wek wore a sleeveless, white silk embroidered dress that made the audience draw breath; Caroline Ribeiro closed the show with an imposing navy-blue ruche organza gown. One caveat: de la Renta also showed skimpy bandeau tops paired with short ballooned skirts, leaving everyone in the audience wondering, Are we really ready for a full-blown pouf revival?</p></div>"
81,spring,2001,s2001,pamela-dennis,"Pegasus, the newly formed American fashion conglomerate, gave wings to Pamela Dennis' Spring 2001collection today. A darling of red-carpet regulars, Dennis showed evening wear that was one part Jean Harlow, one part <em>Ziegfield Follies</em> girl. Models strutted down the runway wearing shimmering satin gowns in colors that varied from warm gold to cool-as-ice platinum and white.</p><p>Dennis' fluid, fishtailed bias-cut dresses—accessorized with diamond broaches and jewelry from Harry Winston—recalled sophisticated '30s Hollywood glamour. In contrast, a gold metal-mesh string bikini was all 2001 in its barely-there-ness. One-shouldered dresses, halter necks and bandeaus emphasized low, low backs, and Dennis' ideal little black dress was matched perfectly with a satchel from her just-launched bag collection.</p></div>"
82,spring,2001,s2001,prada,"With her Spring presentation, Miuccia Prada left behind dainty, rarefied romanticism—and not a moment too soon. In one of her most hard-edged, sexy collections in years, Prada captured the '50s-by-way-of-the-'80s look that showed up on catwalks in New York and London, yet made it distinctly her own.</p><p>The silhouette was pinched, manipulated and focused on voluminous black and gray pleated skirts, some featuring low-slung, studded waistbands. Tops were close to the body, often cropped or cinched at the waist with ribbed cummerbunds. Bursts of color livened up the mood: Yellow pencil skirts with red polos, green blazers with blue turtlenecks, and empire-waist shift dresses all had a slightly askew schoolmarm charm .</p><p>At Prada, accessories are always as important as the clothes. The new graphic, brightly colored cone-heel pumps, some with fluorescent dabs of fuchsia and green, will surely be a hit with those who want to dip their toes in the '80s without going all the way.</p></div>"
83,spring,2001,s2001,ralph-lauren,"""Spectator at its most modern"" is how Ralph Lauren defined Spring 2001. Lauren's collection built upon the polished, well-heeled aesthetic that dominated the New York runways last season, but his new interpretation is graphic and geometric.</p><p>Black-and-white and brown-and-white served as the leitmotif for mod shift leather dresses, blazers with generous trimmed lapels and pockets and sexy two-tone jeans. The season's essential crepe de chine skirt—pleated, to the knee, and paired with a casual cashmere and silk tank—was a laid-back alternative to a sinful white crocodile minisuit. Chevron skirts, pinstriped jackets and a glen-plaid pantsuit were all worn with the same strings of pearls that were a Fall favorite.</p><p>The evening looks were also ladylike and controlled—Lauren gave lace camisoles and georgette pants lift with a touch of beading, and closed his presentation with three impressive floor-length striped gowns.</p></div>"
84,spring,2001,s2001,randolph-duke,"At Randolph Duke, the models paused behind a scrim before taking their turn on a white runway sprinkled with tiny silver sequins. Marilyn Monroe seemed to be the inspiration for a white pleated Lurex velvet number and a series of beaded nude illusion gowns, whereas Duke's full-skirted pleated dance dresses and the black selenium-beaded chiffon gowns recalled Jean Dessés' '50s fashions and '70s Halston, respectively.</p><p>The enthusiastic audience, dotted with West Coast stylists, exploded into applause at the sight of a crystal-beaded illusion dress worn by Ling. Come Oscar time, it is certain that many of these dresses will make the transition from the catwalk to the red carpet.</p></div>"
85,spring,2001,s2001,richard-tyler,"Richard Tyler showed his couture collection on a handful of models, and on mannequins assembled throughout his spacious downtown townhouse. It was a smart move on Tyler's part—editors were able to walk around at their own pace, touching the fabrics and examining the precise craftsmanship and attention to details upon which his reputation is built.</p><p>There was plenty of va-va-voom Hollywood glamour on display: silver beaded jersey dresses with necklines down to there and slits up to here, a translucent red chiffon gown sensually pleated and gathered at the bust and a black silk chiffon jersey column hanging seductively from one shoulder. But, unlike other evening wear designers, Tyler doesn't work solely with the Academy Awards paparazzi in mind. Many of his best pieces were cool and understated, like his ice-green leather suit, geometric printed trench and dress, and hand-stitched blazers.</p></div>"
86,spring,2001,s2001,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret's very grown-up, sophisticated and theatrical collection provided an alternative to the many bubblegum-inspired looks that have shown up this season. Marc Almond sang live, cabaret-style, as Mouret's evening ladies filed out of a hall of mirrors wearing masterfully draped, pleated gowns—this is, after all, a designer who is able to create traffic-stopping dresses out of a piece of fabric and a clothespin.</p><p>Mouret's collection spoke of the haughty glamour of decades past, but avoided the usual trappings. Instead of madly splashing sequins about, he carefully applied them to tears on flowing dresses and pants. A perfectly plain black one-shoulder silk cape dress relied on nothing more than precision of cut to create a stunning effect; a classic liquid white column came equipped with a large black wrap around the neck held in place by a jeweled pin. While many designers strive desperately to invent eye-catching looks that last barely a season, Mouret continues to refine his personal vision of polished femininity.</p></div>"
87,spring,2001,s2001,ruffo-research,"Sophia Kokosalaki reworked some of the themes she had explored in London with her signature line, this time around focusing exclusively on leather. Her palette was light and frothy—pale rose, cappuccino, blush tan. But the main strength of the collection lay in the innovative ways in which leather and suede were treated like ordinary fabric. Paneled skirts were clipped asymmetrically at the hem, resembling glued-together strips of Band-Aids; an extraordinary one-shoulder black dress was twisted into a knot and suspended by a single strap of spaghettilike leather cords. Roomy trousers were pleated along the side and cuffed, worn with a light top and held together with a sash belt. Even the shoes made a statement—gathered pumps and mesh ankle boots grounded the looks.</p><p>Kokosalaki’s silhouette clearly referenced the ’80s, but the end result was fresh and innovative, thanks especially to the skill with which skins were manipulated.</p></div>"
88,spring,2001,s2001,russell-sage,"Russell Sage's clothes always have a personal touch to them. Last season, the designer scoured musty flea markets and off-the-beaten-path antique shops for fabrics. This time around, Sage went skydiving in the name of fashion, using his old parachute to create many looks in his collection.</p><p>Voluminous, '50s-inspired skirts, translucent jackets with flag inlays and antique-looking prints all conveyed a feeling of dejected chic. A deconstructed upside-down jacket and a sharp, orange-piped pantsuit looked surprisingly wearable, as did a beautiful oriental-print top and several asymmetric skirts. The one truly puzzling—and questionable—look in the collection was a bare-back sheath with the logo for <em>Face</em> magazine spray-painted on the front.</p><p>The relationship between clothing and personal history is certainly an intriguing one, and it will be interesting to see how Sage continues to explore this idea.</p></div>"
89,spring,2001,s2001,saint-laurent,"A black carpet flanked by shirtless, sharply suited boys and girls led guests through Paris' Musée Rodin to an impressive black tent, dimly illuminated with fluorescent purple lights, where Tom Ford presented the most anticipated collection of the week. It's a perfect moment to update Saint Laurent's legacy: In a season devoted to powerful women, a new strong-shouldered le smoking, for example, is a must-have item. Throw a light, oversize coat over it, and the night is yours. Ford's new YSL woman also commands attention with sexy minidresses equipped with torso-hugging corsets and straps that twist around the body; others are short in front, with a square-cut panel trailing behind. And what about the street? Try the new generously cut, cropped trousers with a crisp white shirt tucked inside and billowed in the back.</p><p>Ford's strategy was a success because of its directness and simplicity. Very cleverly, Ford reinterpreted only a few essential Saint Laurent favorites—all in black and white—creating a strong, recognizable image for the house, and leaving considerable terrain to explore in the future.</p></div>"
90,spring,2001,s2001,sally-penn,"Born in England, Sally Penn grew up in New Zealand and studied at the Sydney College of the Arts in Australia. She moved to New York in 1994 and soon after was selling her designs at Steven Alan's downtown boutique. Penn's show was full of perfect looks for hip East Village girls. In addition to her signature sporty separates such as striped sleeveless tops, hip-slung pants and tennis-style skirts, she showed cowl-neck tops and dresses.</p></div>"
91,spring,2001,s2001,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel knows a thing or two about the '80s, so it came as no surprise that she managed to play up fashion's current infatuation with fluorescent colors, tight knits, minidresses and anything Fiorucci. Rykiel managed to show well over 100 looks and make them all seem breezy, easy and fun. Gaggles of girls pranced onstage in groups in sleek black bathing suits with metal rings, body-hugging acid yellow, pink, blue and green tube dresses, and the season's requisite bias jerseys in vivid prints. Several very grown-up black dresses and suits with multiple golden zippers added a fetishistic touch to the collection.</p><p>Rykiel embraced the favorable fashion moment and showed why she is considered a true fashion icon. Very few designers have proved to have such staying power—and even fewer have as much fun designing as she does.</p></div>"
92,spring,2001,s2001,sophia-kokosalaki,"After seeing Sophia Kokosalaki's collection today, it was easy to understand why she was appointed to design for Ruffo Research this year. Kokosalaki has quite a way with skins, a highly developed sense of color and the ability to build upon diverse references to create directional fashion.</p><p>Color-blocked leather tops in soft pink, forest green and rich brown paired with flouncy, light skirts opened the show. Grecian-inspired gathered shirts and dresses followed, mixed with spine-pleat leather trousers, wide belts and mesh leather overlays. There was nothing kitschy or self-indulgent about the mix—the ruffled sheer tops with streamers and leather cuffs, pegged trousers and slashed-hem skirts all looked perfectly original and in tune with the fashion moment.</p><p>Kokosalaki provided some of the most brilliant interpretations of this season's must-have draped dress: There was an elaborate black gown with horizontal and vertical gathering, as well as several liquid copper numbers with ruched sleeves and side seams that were not only highly original but perfectly chic.</p></div>"
93,spring,2001,s2001,tristan-webber,"Tristan Webber's models painted quite a picture when they filed down the aisle and waited for the designer to take his bow. Was this the casting call for a new version of <em>Flash Gordon</em>? <em>Return to the Planet of the Space-Age Vixens</em>?</p><p>Webber's very gutsy gals wore everything from red and black leather tops with a shoulder flap, and one-legged and one-armed bodysuits, to top-heavy, silver-trimmed jackets that could've been cut with an Exacto knife, and tiny skirts that exposed skin-tight fetish rubber stockings. Built-in hoods on poured-on satin shirts, exaggerated motorcycle jackets and side-slit trousers were the tamer pieces of a truly outrageous collection.</p><p>Webber's show was a powerful styling exercise, and there is no doubt that he has considerable tailoring skills. But it would've been nice to see at least one piece that could be worn on the street.</p></div>"
94,spring,2001,s2001,tuleh,"Tuleh partners Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley chose a perfect setting for their Spring show: Sotheby's 10th-floor gallery. The designers accessorized their colorful collection with pieces from the auction house's ""Flora and Fauna"" estate jewels, which will be shown to the public in October.</p><p>The match worked: Inspired by Antonio Lopez's fashion illustrations, the duo envisioned ""a woman caught somewhere between grace and the devil, enjoying every second of the ride."" This translated into cheerful printed chiffon dresses with streamers at the cuff, waist or shoulder, some with slit sleeves, all boasting tremendous swagger.</p><p>The lighthearted mood continued with sweet multicolored polka-dotted tops in candy colors, a ruffled strapless black dress, and an off-the-shoulder purple-and-black striped shell with matching asymmetric skirt. But good girls need to have fun too, and Tuleh delivered the goods with skimpy minishorts, glittering jeans, spiky Louboutin heels and an evening dress that most closely resembled a feather orgy.</p></div>"
95,spring,2001,s2001,ungaro-couture,"Lacy see-through dresses have always been one of Ungaro's specialties. This season he ran with the theme, and created a sexy collection that alluded to old-school glamour with a modern twist.</p><p>Ungaro's palette was dreamy and naive: mint julep, pale yellow, rose petal pink, salmon and sporadic shocks of purple. His gowns were sweetly embroidered, draped and appliquéd, but they were also tattered, tied and twisted. Wide belts with large suede flowers and dangling cords and streamers gave the silhouette a feeling of dejected chic. Ungaro also offered some perfectly cut trousers, worn with frayed, ruffled blazers that will look great dressed down with crisp dark jeans. The fitting finale for his presentation: All the girls wafted onstage gradually, forming a chic pastel tableau.</p></div>"
96,spring,2001,s2001,valentino,"Valentino has far too strong of a personal sense of style to let himself go with the trends—don't even <em>dream</em> about pop '80s references here. Instead, he delivered the polished, elegant clothes that his devoted clientele can always expect.</p><p>Small wool or embroidered silk ponchos were a recurring element for both day and evening; linen and crepe suits looked sharp and sexy, fastened at the waist with a delicate bow. Sporty blouson jackets with zippers, balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses and skinny trousers were both relaxed and absolutely proper. The dresses made a bolder statement, evoking the laid-back grandeur of the French Riviera: Organza, taffeta and georgette gowns were printed with polka dots, large florals and graphic animal motifs in shades of chartreuse, mango and, naturally, Valentino red. Evening teetered on the decadent, with slender columns and minute, short dresses that dazzled with a shower of sequins in gold and pink—presumably, Valentino's recipe for a night of excess.</p></div>"
97,spring,2001,s2001,vera-wang,"Vera Wang is a favorite of big-event socialites and high-profile celebrities—after all, her designs can always be counted on to make an audience draw breath. This season was no exception: Wang opened her show with a rich orange zip-front caftan that could be worn with a hood up for movie star-grandeur or down for a casually chic look.</p><p>Hand-painted Jackson Pollock-like prints adorned A-line and sack dresses, a motif that carried on to evening with ""scribble"" beading. There were also a couple of impeccable double-faced wool coats worn with a leather tie belt, and a plethora of simple, carefully detailed chiffon Empire dresses.</p></div>"
98,spring,2001,s2001,versace,"A sudden downpour did not keep anyone away from Donatella Versace's high-powered show, including guests of honor Courtney Love, Christina Ricci and Bruce Willis.</p><p>Lou Reed's ""Vicious"" was an appropriate theme for the skin-hugging white leather skirts, draped chiffon dresses with corset-like belts and bloused boat-neck tops that opened the show. Donatella's mood was relentlessly sexy: Clingy jersey dresses followed, ruched, bat-sleeved or off the shoulder, sometimes hanging on for dear life from a single strap. Black patent-leather coats and dresses, metallic-heeled pumps and nude backs screamed for a night of sin. Less conspicuous looks included Grecian floor-length gowns and brick, magenta and cobalt paint-splattered cocktail dresses that will surely be a spring favorite.</p><p>With her adrenaline-pumped vision of glamour, high-energy shows and talent for cutting perfect little party dresses that attract paparazzi by the flock, it's no wonder Versace's show has become the social event of the season in Milan.</p></div>"
99,spring,2001,s2001,versus-versace,"Practically every single one of Spring's big trends turned up at Versus—from the cranberry gathered-waist cocktail looks that opened the show, to the black halter dresses with slashed cut-outs and nude backs, to the motorcycle jackets —here in satin— that cinched at the waist and billowed at the shoulders. Black lace dresses came sprinkled with rhinestones, while tight ruched skirts and skimpy dresses were accessorized with double-turn belts and large stone buckles. There were also tank tops with streamers and bunched straps, aqua-and-copper printed pantsuits and even a few frankly unflattering culottes-and-blazer combos.</p><p>Since it is a diffusion line, it's understandable that Versus would want to provide accessible looks to its younger clientele. But, as it was, the collection did that and not much more—a sense of evolution, or at least a hint of that old-school Versace flair, was sadly absent.</p></div>"
100,spring,2001,s2001,victor-alfaro,"Victor Alfaro's collection relied on a flowing, breezy silhouette to create a feeling of retro chic. His 46 looks, all in shades of cappuccino, peach, lilac and blush, alluded to the sensual style of a Concorde-hopper circa 1982: There were delicate georgette wraps, pleated satin dresses and generously cut dolman knit tops. Even the most casual looks— an apricot silk knit tube top, walnut suede shorts and feather-light gauze tunics—exuded this imagined brand of luxury.</p><p>There is no doubt that Alfaro has considerable talent and can produce stylish, wearable clothes. Still, his collection relied too heavily on references to the past, as if unsure of making a more directional statement.</p></div>"
101,spring,2001,s2001,viktor-rolf,"There's no business like show business: At a grand old theater on Avenue Wagram, Viktor &amp; Rolf staged a tap-dancing event in the best tradition of Hollywood's golden years.</p><p>A procession of nimble, nubile girls with Louise Brooks bobs and glittering eyelashes high-kicked, stomped and shimmied their way onto the stage, wearing beige, white and light-denim pantsuits, Mackintoshes and pleated shorts. Silver trims on lapels and cuffs, and scalloped edges and ruffles on pristine white shirts, shone in the spotlight. Black tuxedos with wide pants looked adorable rather than severe when accessorized with delicate hair bows; fitted black suits dazzled with white piping. To close the show, the designers themselves took to the stage and executed a perfect dance routine. Now <em>that's</em> entertainment!</p><p>The event was an undisputed crowd pleaser: At one point, as the music segued from ""Singing in the Rain"" to a bizarre tap/hip-hop redux, André Leon Talley, Isabella Blow and Mario Testino all jammed discreetly in their seats. Best of all, we can be sure that Viktor &amp; Rolf's clothes look good on women of all sizes—there was not a 6-foot supermodel in sight. All of the girls on stage were dance students from the Lucia Marthas academy in Holland.</p></div>"
102,spring,2001,s2001,vivienne-tam,"Vivienne Tam doesn't have much luck with weather. Last year, Hurricane Floyd wreaked havoc on New York Fashion Week, forcing Tam to reschedule her show. And today, rains of Biblical proportions descended upon Bryant Park just in time for her presentation. Undaunted, Tam marched on—her models making their entrances with appropriately damp and tousled hair.</p><p>Tam is at her best with accessible, easy-to-wear clothes like the Chrysler-print dresses and black leather jackets and skirts that opened her show. There was also an interesting matte jersey dolman dress with a metal choker that looked much fresher than her heavily beaded, overly ornate looks. A white skirt with a sparse, geometric sprinkling of crystals, worn with a simple berry cardigan, was far chicer than the overdone pink and blue computer-print sequined looks. In Tam's case, less is often more.</p></div>"
103,spring,2001,s2001,wink,"Love was in the air at Wynn Smith's Spring collection. Thematically the show—which consisted of five vignettes—was about an Amish girl who saw pictures of Prince William at a polo match and fell in love with him. The show began with four all-black ensembles and closed with a wedding dress (also black, with a quilted appliqué) and two ""bridesmaids.""</p><p>The ""Polo Match"" and ""Eton"" vignettes featured man-tailored separates made of Prince of Wales plaid, which was meant to evoke an English feel. A shirt-jacket and shorts ensemble, as well as white shorts cut like jodhpurs, were particularly effective.</p><p>This season Smith paid homage to Rei Kawakubo (much as he did to Stephen Sprouse last Fall). To this end, there were many interesting back treatments, cutouts and asymmetries. Thematic organizations aside, there were strong pieces to be found in this collection, which followed its own plot line rather than the season's trends.</p></div>"
104,spring,2001,s2001,yohji-yamamoto,"This season, Yohji Yamamoto turned his attention to suiting and draping—swathing and wrapping the body in his unique, highly evolved manner.</p><blockquote class=""BlockquoteEmbedWrapper-sc-SdiGL cISoXl blockquote-embed""><div class=""BlockquoteEmbedContent-esRbGs gkrpNW blockquote-embed__content""><p>br&gt; His masculine take on pinstripes and black suits consisted of strong-shouldered, side-fastening coat jackets with long, asymmetric tails. Trousers were loose and sometimes oversize: There was a huge-waisted pair cinched at the hips, with excess fabric dangling at the side. Fluid black dresses were gathered at the side and featured a train that could be attached to the wrist, the hem draping around the body. Deceptively simple-looking columns had extra panels that could become practical pockets; there was also a sumptuously knit sweater, skirt and tote combo.</p></div></blockquote><p>Experimentation is a given at any Yamamoto show, so it was no surprise when fluid gowns appeared complete with built-in bags. Some were cinched and attached to the back of the dress, while others, strategically placed on the side, became perfect hand warmers. The most dazzling look: a flowing strap dress with a sequined coin purse, complete with hardware clasp, resting at the back—the perfect marriage between function and design.</p></div>"
1,fall,2001,f2001,alberta-ferretti,"Models wafted onstage in a zig-zag pattern on Alberta Ferretti's extra-wide runway, ultimately forming a gray and black army of perfectly nice girls exploring their more daring side.</p><p>There was a vintage feeling to many of Ferretti's short velvet dresses, wool minishifts and top-stitched leather coats. Everyday basics included sharp, straight trousers, chiffon aqua shirts, pearly satin tops and skirts pleated at the knee. Ferretti's main strength remains her way with frothy, delicate femininity—in her hands, last season's punky strapped dresses became subtly knotted and gathered slips embellished with short streamers and beaded insets, Empire-waist baby-doll dresses, and rough-cut (but always delicate and feather-light) sheaths.</p></div>"
2,fall,2001,f2001,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Fall for Alessandro Dell'Acqua is all about strong femininity. The designer played with many of the recurring themes that have surfaced in recent seasons—asymmetric sheer dresses, layered transparencies and hard-edged suits—and made them his own.</p><p>Relying mostly on a stark palette of black, white and tan, Dell'Acqua played up the contrast between softness and strength for which he is well-known. Sheer tulle tops wafted over bondage-like bandeau straps. Satin blazers and pencil skirts provided a sleek alternative to paillette-trimmed chiffon skirts and flouncy dresses. Sleek leather trousers and bombers, tuxedolike coats and metal-heeled strap boots also looked sharp.</p><p>As if to remind us that minimalism (and his signature underwear line) can be perfectly sexy, Dell'Acqua sent all the models out for their final tour of the runway in nothing but skimpy body maillots.</p></div>"
3,fall,2001,f2001,alexander-mcqueen,"Colorful lights, a merry-go-round, the sound of children? Alexander McQueen's mise-en-scène brought to mind family trips, fun and games, and maybe a couple of lighthearted mimes.</p><p>But once the lights went down and the blaring soundtrack began, it became perfectly clear that there was nothing even remotely candy-coated about his lascivious carnival crashers. Cavorting and gyrating around poles, a posse of hard-as-nails girls took over the stage wearing shiny patent-leather jackets and jeans, scalloped coats and skirts, S&amp;M overcoats, skintight leather pants and ornate military jackets that would've put Napoleon to shame. A nearly naked princess turned up in little more than a feathered headdress, a net gown and a few chains; her cohorts wore frayed sweaters with giant skulls and bones, and long suit jackets that became dresses as they wrapped around the body and then draped at the side.</p><p>When the frantic pace finally slowed down, it was to reveal an eerie backdrop of gigantic stuffed animals, discarded dolls, puppets, balloons and ragged circus paraphernalia, out of which several macabre characters emerged, wearing massive ruffles, centuries-old suits and beat-up lace. The perfect accessory? One of McQueen's otherworldly creatures dragged around a golden skeleton with her foot.</p></div>"
4,fall,2001,f2001,alexandre-matthieu,"In a grandiose salon of France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, complete with glittering chandeliers, fresco ceilings and gilded walls, newcomers Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau presented their second formal collection.</p><p>Emphasizing their love of tailoring, Morgado and Bureau went for precise, low-buttoned tuxedo jackets with rounded lapels paired with double-cuff trousers; graphic star prints were shown layered on dresses to create a quasi-holographic effect, while leather jackets and traditional frocks were cheekily adorned with swirling ribbons. Alexandre Matthieu's playful take on ladylike dressing included a cross-your-heart puff of fur, a long dress with a trompe-l'oeil bolero detail, and a beaded silver-and-black coat worn with stockings that would've looked perfectly appropriate on an extravagant circus ringmistress.</p><p>Forgoing the heavy-handed conceptualism of many new designers in favor of a light, joyous approach to design, Morgado and Bureau are well on their way to carving out a distinctive niche for themselves.</p></div>"
5,fall,2001,f2001,alice-roi,"For her collection inspired by ""educated virgins,"" Alice Roi combined dollhouse jewelry (made from real dollhouse furniture) and could-not-possibly-be-any-shorter minis. Her selection of the Honoré Daumier print <em>La Caricature</em> (a drawing of two snobs turning up their noses at each other), which turned up on dresses and tops, exemplified her love of parody and play.</p><p>Eighties references were on hand in a pair of Sebagos with heels, super-bright colors and asymmetries. But pervasive sailor styles, dropped waists, pleated skirts and leg-of-mutton sleeves referenced the early '20s. One standout was an almost preppy sweater with a sailing motif, worn with one straight and one puffy sleeve. And a black cashmere minidress with a <em>La Caricature</em> banner would have made Coco Chanel proud.</p></div>"
6,fall,2001,f2001,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester's clothes have soul. With a predominantly black aesthetic dominating and practically every designer jumping on the tough-edge bandwagon, her subtle, richly textured designs appear particularly meaningful this season.</p><p>Case in point: Demeulemeester showed a selection of looks that surely required several courses in engineering to complete, but that still managed to look absolutely effortless on the runway. A jacket billowed out to form a cape in the back but came with faux sleeves stitched to the side—in fact, two hidden slits allowed the arms to escape in case of extreme necessity; a hidden cincture dramatically surfaced in the front, giving the silhouette a seemingly inexplicable pinch. Demeulemeester's loose sweater dresses were gathered with multiple-strand skinny belts; leather jackets sat at the hips, while a monastic high-collar coat nearly grazed the floor.</p><p>Occasional flashes of color included clouds of dark red on billowy shirts that offered a delicate contrast to the starker looks. A serene, moody soundtrack perfectly complemented the well-thought-out collection.</p></div>"
7,fall,2001,f2001,anna-sui,"The key to Anna Sui's look is her constant juggling of cultural references—a madcap mixing of diverse styles and time periods. For Fall, Sui's stylistic collage includes graphic, two-tone wool knit jackets and mod shift-dresses, layers of tweed piled upon each other, colorful pop floral shirts with matching ties and patent-leather motorcycle jackets.</p><p>Sui struck a chord with her vision of a modern-day Carnaby Street dandy: Glittery pants, beaded paisley shirts and long, mixed-weave coats made you want to stay out all night. Her wide-wale corduroy pants, long military coats and black velvet strapless dresses with voluminous skirts proved that she can make quieter statements as well. Things got a bit out of control with pirate hats, metallic leather coats and multicolor patchwork numbers, but some would argue that over-the-top attitude has always been a part of Sui's allure.</p></div>"
8,fall,2001,f2001,antonio-berardi,"It's an undisputed fact that Antonio Berardi knows how to cut a mean, lean pair of trousers and an ultrasexy dress. One wishes, however, that the designer would direct his energies in more controlled ways.</p><p>Berardi's show felt like a wild fireworks display. Fitted jackets were reversed to button in the back, lacy white lingerie tops morphed into flared rockabilly skirts and enormous shearling coats were savagely sliced. As if all this weren't enough, Berardi threw in distressed jeans lavished with buttons, whale-bone corsets, layered sheer slips, and hot-pink and acid-yellow gowns drowning in ruffles.</p><p>Some of these looks will guarantee a night of fun out on the town, but others, like the shaved-fur cargo Bermuda shorts, should never have made it past the drawing board.</p></div>"
9,fall,2001,f2001,arkadius,"""Prostitution"" was the theme for what Arkadius described as his most salable collection to date. ""This is a reaction to those who attack designers because they create commercial clothes,"" said Arkadius, proudly wearing a jacket stamped with call-girl ads. ""Are designers prostitutes when we meet people halfway?""</p><p>Arkadius did show less extravagant clothes than usual, including net tops and plenty of sensible skirts and jackets with flattering button trims. ""Until my dream of streets that look like catwalks comes true,"" said Arkadius, ""designers have to find a way to survive."" But no one need worry that the Polish-born designer will be competing with the Gap anytime soon; his presentation still featured plenty of independent-minded verve. Loose pinstripe pants were worn with a sleeveless knit top that looked as if it were about to disintegrate; sheepskin dresses, muskrat corsets and head-trapping balloons shouldn't be turning up in corporate boardrooms anytime soon.</p></div>"
10,fall,2001,f2001,badgley-mischka,"""Our collection is a lot younger this season,"" said Mark Badgley backstage. ""We've added a lot of day looks. Of course, our day begins at around 5 p.m.""</p><p>Badgley Mischka's version of sensible, go-anywhere looks included everything from body-hugging burgundy leather ensembles, pleated satin skirts, spaghetti-strap bustier tops, cowl-neck gold sweaters, shearling jackets and even a couple of monotone corduroy looks. But publicity-crazed starlets shopping for their Oscar selections needn't panic—there are still plenty of sequin-drenched gowns to attract hordes of paparazzi, and an attention-grabbing tuxedo with a fitted jacket and flowing trousers.</p><p>Badgley Mischka provided some sensible alternatives to their well-known repertoire of event-tailored dresses, but their collection would've benefited from a thoughtful edit and a more defined point of view.</p></div>"
11,fall,2001,f2001,balenciaga,"All week long, the question on everybody's mind was: What would Nicolas Ghesquière, the man who has been dubbed “fashion's new messiah,” do to top himself at Balenciaga?</p><p>Ghesquière's success has everything to do with his ability to subtly evoke a variety of references, altogether avoiding clichés and creating clothes that are richly layered in meaning and almost impossible to categorize. The early 1900s were a point of departure for his black-and-gray collection, but Ghesquière's architectural and impeccably executed designs soon took on a life all their own. Tight vests created hourglass silhouettes, some with exaggerated hips; front plackets on tops were tightly wound and crisscrossed like lace-up corsets. His fitted trousers, which have a devout cult following, were studded to match buckle jackets; miniskirts came with layer upon layer of ruffles, pleats, tassels, and appliqués that never looked redundant or heavy-handed.</p><p>Given his ongoing success, will Ghesquière launch his own label anytime soon? “I'm very happy at Balenciaga,” said the designer after the show. “But I also want to work on my own line. The ideal would be to do both things simultaneously.”</p></div>"
12,fall,2001,f2001,bcbg-max-azria,"It's not hard to understand why BCBG has a substantial following all over the world—designer Max Azria has an uncanny ability to appropriate major currents in fashion and make them accessible to a general market.</p><p>Accompanied by an earsplitting soundtrack of mid-'90s Prodigy techno, Azria sent out everything from moleskin trenches and trousers to leather strip jackets, scalloped minidresses and pleated bustiers that brought to mind Helmut Lang's Spring dominatrix-inspired collection. As if to make sure not to miss a single trend, Azria also included corduroy suits, flouncy chiffon dresses, glimmering Lurex tops and plenty of waist-sculpting leather cage belts in the spirit of Tom Ford's recent corseted Gucci collection.</p><p>Accessories ran the gamut from simple black leather pumps and slides to punky ankle booties and frankly intriguing bags with thick chain handles and dangling adornments.</p></div>"
13,fall,2001,f2001,behnaz-sarafpour,"In an age when designers routinely shoot to fame by way of hype and self-promotion, Behnaz Sarafpour is counting on her solid training and precise eye to put her a step above the competition. At 31, Sarafpour has worked with Narciso Rodriguez, Richard Tyler and, most notably, Isaac Mizrahi; as if this weren';t enough, she also designs Barneys New York's private label.</p><p>""My debut collection is about a new, modern take on black-tie dressing"" she says.""For example, I took the classic satin strip of men's tuxedo trousers and reworked it into a rose-puff bolero shrug."" Other highlights include a dashing cashmere top paired with white sailor pants and a sexy one-sleeve cocktail dress that was painstakingly hand-beaded.</p><p>Whether it's a simple cotton crepe camisole, a stretch lace shirt or a sharp, masculine suit, Sarafpour invariably turns out modern, sophisticated clothes that already seem destined to withstand the test of time.</p></div>"
14,fall,2001,f2001,benjamin-cho,"Having tested the waters with smaller presentations in the past, up-comer Benjamin Cho showed a full-fledged collection this season, proving that he is one of New York's most promising young talents.</p><p>Cho's impressive tailoring skills were abundantly clear in his deconstructed crepe suits that morphed into flowing capes: A long jacket was sharply cropped to form a minidress, while its sleeves ballooned to enormous proportions and created a draped back. A black bustier corset gave way to a braided dress with tassels cascading over a long fishtail skirt, while a clean, crisp white shirtdress was anchored down with a triple-loop waist tie.</p><p>Cho also showed a couple of stunning wide-knit dresses that sensually hugged every curve of the body and looked as if they were held together by the mercy of God.</p></div>"
15,fall,2001,f2001,bernhard-willhelm,"At Paris' legendary Moulin Rouge, Bernhard Willhelm ran full speed ahead with a powerful, beautiful and at times slightly overwhelming presentation.</p><p>Gone were last season's adorable little homemakers with embroidered aprons and Heidi-like demeanor. Willhelm replaced them with tribes of nomads that wore long, striped overcoats, monastic dresses, twisted tops and kimono-style jackets. A giant projection of dancing skeletons served as a backdrop for colorful patchwork skirts, fringed shirts, argyle sweaters and tapestry-inlaid coats. Willhelm also showed several looks stamped with a random list of first names, which resembled a meaningless barrage of newspaper-print logos. Spanking-white sneakers kept the looks fresh and focused.</p><p>Willhelm's collection could've used a bit of editing, but with this show it's clear that the German-born designer is one to watch very closely in the future.</p></div>"
16,fall,2001,f2001,betsey-johnson,"With an old key that dangled from a strand of pink ribbon, Betsey Johnson opened wide the doors to her closet for all the world to see. Out from Pandora's box sprang an array of mini-Betseys: All Johnson's models wore assorted hair extensions, a lightning-bolt tattoo on their chests, and plenty of lace teddies, net tutus in neon colors, striped Clamdiggers, Lurex-knit mini-tops and an abundance of corsets.</p><p>In Johnson's universe, a party dress is printed with pterodactyls and sweeping birds; sweaters have different-colored sleeves, and velveteen coats are thrown over camouflage wool-knit dresses. Trousers for a pantsuit are cut low enough to allow a sliver of acid-green underwear to peek out, and jackets are snapped as close to the body as possible. Modern-day cancan girls cavort in emerald, sapphire and fuchsia brassiere tops, layered transparencies, and glittering heels that are part <em>Wizard of Oz</em> and part Times Square after dark.</p><p>""These are clothes that I love,"" said Johnson simply. ""I wanted to create a whole new wardrobe for myself—and hopefully, for many others as well!""</p></div>"
17,fall,2001,f2001,bill-blass,"Passing the torch in a venerable fashion house is a dangerous game. Expectations from clients, buyers and critics run high when legendary shoes are to be filled. When Bill Blass retired last year, Steven Slowik was handed the reigns and faced with a daunting Catch-22: Stay true to Blass' consummately conservative roots but innovate enough to spark some precious fashion buzz. Slowik missed the target by a long shot in the single awkward and unflattering collection he designed at Blass, and was promptly shown the door.</p><p>So this January, with only a month before the Fall 2001 shows, Bill Blass Ltd. found itself flying without a pilot and pulled up one of its staff designers, the Swedish-born and Paris-trained Lars Nilsson, to put together a collection. And in a few short weeks, Nilsson pulled together a robust collection of unmistakably Bill Blass clothes: bold red cashmere coats, pinstripe suits and trim satin trenchcoats. The core of Nilsson's style is conservative enough to fit the Bill Blass image, with plush fabrics and familiar shapes, but the Swedish designer keeps it all looking current with minimal embellishments and sleek tailoring.</p></div>"
18,fall,2001,f2001,blaak,"Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, the duo behind Blaak, met while studying fashion design at Central Saint Martins and have been inseparable ever since. Their debut collection, which they showed in 1998 while still in college, was immediately snapped up by London's hip Browns Focus boutique, which has carried the label ever since. Blaak's strength lies in translating forward-thinking ideas into accessible clothes that retain a distinct air of individuality. Take their Fall collection, where traditional preppy style was reinterpreted with deep-plunging pink vests, sensible button-downs, and snappy pencil skirts decorated with trompe l'oeil bows and crisscrossed ribbons. More daring experiments included puff-sleeve tops, generous prom skirts in bright hues, and quasi-military jackets with substantial epaulets that were pinned over and in front of the shoulders like folded wings.<br/>&lt;r&gt;Designed for a young, urban and in-the-know clientele, Blaak's clothes effortlessly convey a spirit of quiet subversion.&lt;/r&gt;</p></div>"
19,fall,2001,f2001,bottega-veneta,"Bottega Veneta creative director Laura Moltedo officially appointed British newcomer Giles Deacon designer of the well-known leather label this season. With this move, and after having been recently purchased by the Gucci conglomerate, Bottega Veneta is undergoing a major face-lift that could lead to a completely new identity.</p><p>Deacon made no bones about the house's shift in direction. Weathered, zippered and extra-wide jeans opened the show, followed by tiny miniskirts slashed with zippers and funky jackets with flashy metallic fastenings. A leather puffy jacket was drop-dead cool; the same can be said of a woven-leather overcoat and a couple of black corduroy suits with leather shoulder insets. A series of green-and-yellow logo looks was not as successful; but on the whole, Deacon established a strong, dramatic image that is sure to put the spotlight on Bottega Veneta.</p></div>"
20,fall,2001,f2001,boudicca,"You will not be wearing Boudicca’s clothing to the grocery store, to work or even to a nightclub. As a matter of fact, unless you’re the guest of honor at a museum reception for an exhibition on deconstruction and architecture, it’s unlikely that you will find much use at all for a striped pantsuit with tie sashes across the legs and breasts, or an enormous, stiff leather corset with positively dangerous edges.</p><p>Of course, fashion is not just about cashmere twin sets—and, to be fair, Boudicca did show several wearable looks, like a belted cream Kimono coat worn over culottes, an aged leather coat with paneled insets and several beautifully draped dresses with gold straps. Still, at a moment when even the most intellectual fashion seems to be moving away from angst-ridden conceptualism, Boudicca’s dramatic clothes, however beautiful they may be, look at times as if they were <em>behind</em> and not <em>ahead</em> of the times.</p></div>"
21,fall,2001,f2001,bruce,"To the romantic South American tune of <em>Tuyo Es Mi Corazón</em>, the downtown design team of Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli opened New York Fashion Week with a carefully planned, immaculately executed collection (sponsored by Shishido), that delivered a thoroughly modern idea of chic.</p><p>This fall, Bruce girls will still rely on those well-known slim trousers that lengthen the legs for miles—only now they’re done in the softest possible corduroy, and paired with delicately draped tops, fitted blazers with pleated lapels and formfitting leather jackets. For drinks on the town, there are sexy jersey dresses that allude to the current Grecian craze but avoid falling into a facile disco-princess retro vibe, thanks to their looser cut and smart touches like asymmetric necklines, gathered sleeves and embroidered details.</p><p>“The general look is very linear, but manipulated to create movement and follow the natural draping of the fabric,” said Gutierrez before the show. “The effect is very subtle from a distance, but when you inspect the clothes up close, you realize there’s a tremendous amount of work involved.”</p></div>"
22,fall,2001,f2001,burberry-prorsum,"Roberto Menichetti not only wants to update Burberry's image; he is intent on propelling the label into the future by exploring the interaction between classic notions of elegance and cutting-edge materials.</p><p>Menichetti kept frills to a minimum, working with a restrained palette of pale gray, navy, beige and putty; roomy safari coats with chic tunnel belts were thrown over sensible shirts and trousers in ""stretch"" and ""carbon,"" new fabrics that maintain the body's temperature. But technological fibers met their match with fine boiled cashmere turtlenecks, wool gabardine wrap skirts, and milk-soaked leather overcoats and motorcycle jackets. Menichetti also showed a couple of large-cut blazers that revived a vintage version of Burberry's signature plaid and looked subtle and restrained, in keeping with the minimal spirit of the collection.</p></div>"
23,fall,2001,f2001,cacharel,"Cardboard chandeliers, fake little chairs and painted-on curtains at Clements Ribeiro's show for Cacharel announced that the couple was in a playful mood.</p><p>With their ""cari-couture"" collection, Clements Ribeiro succeeded once again in injecting Cacharel with a girly, playful spirit, revisiting fashion clichés with an ironic eye. The trompe-l'oeil theme that has been so prevalent this season was everywhere here: Western shirts had printed-on pockets and stitches, gray suits flaunted make-believe tassels and pretty dresses were embellished with faux bows and necklaces. Toto-like dogs formed a black, red and white optic print on otherwise prim and proper skirts and tops; fly-away dresses were crawling with panthers or trimmed in star-shaped rhinestones.</p><p>Amid the fun, Clements Ribeiro didn't forget to include all the basics a cool Cacharel girl will require next Fall: a boyish tuxedo blazer, a flashy corduroy suit and coat (choose between purple or red), a few sweatshirts, plenty of two-tone heels and ankle booties, and even a couple of short little fur vests.</p></div>"
24,fall,2001,f2001,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein closed New York Fashion Week with a hard-edged, no-nonsense collection that neatly encapsulates the pared-down aesthetic that is a key component for Fall.</p><p>It’s a perfect moment for Klein, who clearly feels right at home designing austere, stylish basics with a mannish twist. In his hands, the most subtle details are all it takes to make a difference: His black wool winter coat, for example, comes with a built-in, low-slung double-loop leather belt that gives it a perfect air of nonchalant chic. A classic peacoat is cut loose and slouchy, as if to emphasize the slim proportions of a short, sexy shift. Klein’s shearling dresses and aged, crackled napa vests, trousers and military coats are perfect for an urban warrior.</p><p>But even the toughest girls need lightness and femininity once in a while, so Klein also sent out plenty of body-skimming asymmetric silk jersey dresses with playful cutouts—just as long as you remember to wear them with tough ankle boots instead of conventional heels.</p></div>"
25,fall,2001,f2001,carolina-herrera,"""It's a very sleek and svelte collection,"" announced Carolina Herrera backstage, as her audience poured into the tents at Bryant Park. ""My emphasis is on creating clothes that are perfect for right now—simplicity works best for me.""</p><p>With fashion winding down from over-the-top excesses of seasons past, Herrera emphasized a slim, unfettered silhouette punctuated by luxurious details like lace embroideries on shirts, asymmetric hemlines on georgette skirts and diamant¿ buckles on tuxedo jackets and dresses. Whimsical pieces included a black leather spinal-pleat wrap jacket, a belted Russian lynx coat and several sleeveless chinchilla sweaters.</p><p>Herrera's evening segment referenced last season's love affair with the early '80s: There were feathered tops, formfitting lace skirts and several off-the-shoulder stretch satin dresses aimed at the younger Park Avenue set.</p></div>"
26,fall,2001,f2001,celine,"Michael Kors' New York equestrienne did not show up at Celine; instead, she turned to Nantucket and Berlin for sartorial inspiration.</p><p>Kors' forte has always been relaxed sportswear—and his opening look, a distressed canvas jean, plaid shirtdress and reversible coyote fur, announced that this was to be a particularly pared-down moment. Checkered skirts and blazers, casual burgundy trousers, zip-up jackets and roomy trenches followed, sometimes accessorized with a plush fur neck-wrap.</p><p>Kors changed gears from the rustic to the hard-edged with military overcoats, naval trousers, battle jackets and S&amp;M-style leather caps that would've driven Marlene Dietrich to delirium. The eclectic melange continued with wisps of lingerie and rugged tweeds; evening looks consisted of long pleated gowns, fragile slip dresses and bed-ready camisoles worn with rugged boots, enormous bouclé coats and savage furs.</p></div>"
27,fall,2001,f2001,cerruti,"Madison Avenue regulars will be delighted to find that Peter Speliopoulos tackled at Cerruti many of the season's recurring themes, making them accessible to a perfectly proper audience.</p><p>His take on masculine tailoring included high-collar button-up shirts, roomy blazers and two-button overcoats with rounded edges. Paillette-encrusted flirty white shifts referenced the mod mood that was so prevalent in Milan. Little capes fluttered over straight trousers, and cocktail dresses revealed geometric flashes of skin in the back. Sexy ribbon dresses, pom-pom-trimmed necklines, and button-lined deep-slit skirts and gowns closed the show.</p><p>Speliopoulos' clothes are certainly chic and polite; but one wishes the designer would take an occasional risk or two and give Cerruti a more directional spin.</p></div>"
28,fall,2001,f2001,chloe,"Stella McCartney continued with her exploration of grown-up, couture-inspired silhouettes for Chloé, without forgetting about the youthful, fun-loving basics that are the label's bread and butter.</p><p>McCartney's forte is her ability to glam up casual street clothes. Her fitted jeans and corduroy trousers with zipper pockets, face-stenciled T-shirts and pearl-encrusted draped tops all had an air of insouciant cool to them; so did the faux furs with shaved bits that accommodated clusters of silver flowers. However, when McCartney turned to complicated floor-length skirts, boned coats and tie-up corsets, the show took a turn for the heavy-handed. Sea-grass embroidery growing on the side of trousers or completely claiming a dress or coat added a more dynamic air to the collection.</p></div>"
29,fall,2001,f2001,christian-dior,"Having thoroughly exhausted the minutiae of white-trash glamour, John Galliano turned to global ravers, fabulous hip-hop queens and Irish-gypsy boxers à la Brad Pitt's character in <em>Snatch</em> for inspiration.</p><p>Sound confusing? Relax. Call it what you will, Galliano delivered some of the most relevant clothes Dior has seen in seasons. Pinstripe suits with leather and flower-print front plackets, neo-dandy check blazers, leather overcoats, rakish hats, and colorful foulards and ties all gave Dior a new—and commercially rewarding—dimension. “Boom box” bags, large circular cases, denim saddle totes and metallic lunchboxes will also keep cash registers busy at Dior boutiques worldwide.</p><p>That's not to say that Galliano was denied his fun. Witness his holographic silver jackets, ghetto-blaster graffiti ensembles, unlined, zigzag chinchillas and shiny patent blousons. In lesser hands the whirlpool of references would've fizzled out, but Galliano's thuggish suits, fandango skirts, gypsy-hippie dresses, patchwork coats, and boxing robes and trousers all worked wonderfully.</p></div>"
30,fall,2001,f2001,christian-lacroix,"As expected, Christian Lacroix stepped in to add a touch of color and whimsy to a predominantly dark, stark season.</p><p>Contrasting solids were played up to the max. Yellow, lime-green and bubblegum-pink turtlenecks were surefire attention grabbers when paired with sorbet furs trimmed with dangling miniature tails and flashy stockings. Lacroix's jackets were reversed and shown over narrow tapestry trousers; a red square-spangled trench shimmered in the light, while a long, black suede dress with studded leather insets and long streamers brought to mind hard-core chic.</p><p>At times, however, Lacroix's flights of fancy strayed off compass, and his runway became a hypnotic jumble of sequins, patchwork, ruffles and color-drenched prints that competed simultaneously for attention.</p></div>"
31,fall,2001,f2001,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro can normally be relied on to deliver chic and accessible clothes with an understated edge. This season, however, the duo aimed for a racier look, with decidedly mixed results.</p><p>Individual pieces worked just fine: A couple of bright rugby shirts spoke of casual cool; a corduroy military jacket with a drawstring waist looked great on Alek Wek. Polka-dotted turtlenecks were lighthearted and sweet, while slim trousers, pencil skirts and paillette-front tops remained sharp and to the point. It's a shame the designers didn't stay on that track: A series of leopard-print bombers, overcoats and trousers looked bizarrely out of place; vampy fur vests and asymmetric fly-away dresses failed to make a forceful statement.</p><p>By attempting to cover too much ground, Clements Ribeiro's collection lost much of its focus.</p></div>"
32,fall,2001,f2001,comme-des-garcons,"Evolution is the name of the game chez Comme des Garçons. “Everything is step-by-step,” Rei Kawakubo once told André Leon Talley. “Ten years ago, 10 years later—it’s all the same to me.” While the designer doesn’t repeat herself, she does revisit concepts. A sub-theme of Kawakubo’s Spring 2001 show, which included pieces made of fetish-y transparent plastic, was the peekaboo game of reveal/conceal. She doubled down on that idea in her Fall 2001 Beyond Taboo collection, which tackled sex—and the material manifestations of erotica—in all its corseted, cone-bra’d, satin, and lace glory.</p><p>This set critics agog. But is sex really so foreign in Kawakubo’s world? While it’s true that the designer rejects the idea that clothes must reveal the body to attract a partner, her use of transparency suggests she’s not a prude. It seems significant that the collection was shown in France, the land in which <em>l’amour</em> is a national sport and where Jean Baudrillard, the postmodern theorist, suggested that “seduction . . . never belongs to the order of nature, but that of artifice—never to the order of energy, but that of signs and rituals.” Defined thus, seduction sounds a lot like fashion, whose often outdated rules and assumptions are fuel to Kawakubo’s fire.</p></div>"
33,fall,2001,f2001,costume-national,"It's an undeniable fact that black reigns supreme this season, but at times runways are acquiring decidedly funereal overtones.</p><p>Ennio Capasa has always favored an austere silhouette, so he surely feels at home now that fashion is infatuated with everything dark. Capasa showed a plethora of jackets—oversize with extra-long sleeves, single- and double-breasted, satin-trimmed and plain—paired with an equally exhaustive range of turtleneck tops that seemed to blend into an endless parade of black. A couple of olive coats with pointed shoulders, a miniskirt or two, and several bright green satin suits did little to lighten the weighty atmosphere.</p><p>Capasa's cocktail dresses—puzzling collages of embroidered lace, satin and leather—played up the all-too-familiar juxtaposition of hard and soft fabrics that most designers are exploring for Fall, but failed to deliver an innovative twist.</p></div>"
34,fall,2001,f2001,cynthia-rowley,"With a cast of characters that included a juggler, an accordion player, a mime and an acrobat, Cynthia Rowley injected high-energy fun into New York fashion week at Manhattan's New Victory Theater.</p><p>Rowley played with cotton-candy party dresses, trompe-l'oeil detailing, outrageous plume wraps, two-toned jester skirts and mismatched stockings to create a veritable vaudeville atmosphere. Not everyone will go for the Pierrot-inspired themes, but Rowley also showed more down-to-earth pieces that included corduroy trousers and coats, merino tees, cable-knit sweaters and moleskin jeans. There were also several great pinstripe pants, jackets with sequined lions embroidered at the shoulder and a couple of sleek takes on classic tuxedos that will work well with the younger set.</p></div>"
35,fall,2001,f2001,d-g,"How to best describe D&amp;G's fabulous, over-the-top rock groupies? Think of them as nostalgic, romantic rebels.</p><p>Dolce &amp; Gabbana's younger customers are the kind of girls who are confident enough to cause a scene in beaded AC/DC concert T-shirts, Debbie Harry ""French Kissin'"" tops, sexy dresses that zip up in front and back, flashy acid-washed jeans and massive faux furs. But naughty girls need love too, and they are willing to reveal their softer side with puff-sleeved Edwardian denim jackets, chiffon blouses with streamers and the season's requisite baby-doll dresses. For quiet moments at home, there are chunky Andean jumpers and huge off-the-shoulder sweater dresses.</p></div>"
36,fall,2001,f2001,daryl-k,"Daryl Kerrigan likes her clothes lean, mean and ultra sexy, and this season she went all the way with her racy aesthetic. Wallflowers be warned: These clothes are not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Kerrigan rocked the house with diamond-tucked vamp dresses, boy blazers that hung over teensy miniskirts, silk bondage pants and a few Edwardian jackets, albeit shrunken and severely tweaked. Toying with male/female stereotypes, Kerrigan went for drab-olive military parkas accessorized by glittery embroidered shawls; a Kraftwerk-like red shirt and black skinny tie looked deadly sharp with a pleated, tight mini.</p><p>Kerrigan also explored draping with a couple of jersey dresses, but the skinny, aggressive looks were the ones that worked best.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hyh41q""></div></div><p>What does a seen-it-all downtown New Yorker wear to a shindig?

Presumably, von Furstenberg's archetypal female is a combination of Tori Spelling, Mary J. Blige and the Hilton sisters, who all lined her front row.</p><p>Longtime DVF devotees will go for the abundance of slinky jersey wraps, body-skimming turtlenecks and playful tie-shoulder tops in graphic prints. But Von Furstenberg is clearly intent on taking her line a step beyond her well-known classics, so this season she's added light tweeds with chiffon insets, laser-cut felt coats, tartan plaids, tailored suits and plenty of slim trousers to the mix. Cocktail hour was inspired by Madame Grés and consisted of asymmetric drawstring jersey gowns, short draped dresses and simple tunics that looked sexy and effortless, if a bit repetitive at times.</p></div>"
38,fall,2001,f2001,dolce-gabbana,"A moss-covered stone water fountain, flowery arches and floors strewn with autumn leaves left no doubt: Romance was in the air at Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But needless to say, the Italian duo's idea of gracious country life is far from sedate.</p><p>From a wooden farmhouse emerged glamorous desert bohemians clad in extra-long hip-hugging, double-belted distressed leather pants, billowy striped tops and dangling fox tails. The vintage feeling continued with fitted corduroy trousers and oversize blazers, flea-market suede and fur jackets, and tattered blue jeans. Dolce and Gabbana clearly had a blast mixing the old and the new; slouchy pants and oversize hobo sweaters and scarves alternated with sheer floral camisoles, sharp military coats with multiple diamanté buckles, Wild West fringed bags and tall prairie boots. In a nutshell: anything and everything a sensible girl could possibly need.</p></div>"
39,fall,2001,f2001,donna-karan,"Donna Karan is famous for her consistently feminine, wearable clothing that speaks to the great diversity of women.</p><p>This season, Karan explored less conventional avenues with a richly textured and layered collection that could best be described as savage luxe. Relying on a relentlessly monochromatic palette, Karan sent out ravaged chiffon skirts, wide-gauge knit sweaters, tribal-inspired patchwork shearling coats, spider-web crochet overlays and severely distressed slips. Evening maintained the raw-edged motif, with gilded dresses that could've been dug out of a centuries-old treasure chest.</p><p>Those who are not adventurous enough to indulge in a post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max</em> makeover will turn to Karan's take on the current equestrian theme, which included khaki cavalry jackets and wrapped riding trousers, as well as aged-leather storm coats.</p></div>"
40,fall,2001,f2001,dries-van-noten,"With spic-and-span white coats, fluffy après-ski jumpers and practical zip-up jackets, Dries Van Noten graciously stepped in to deliver a wave of color and lightness amidst Fall's sea of black.</p><p>Peach leather trenches, speckled blue jeans and gray corduroy suits with important shoulders shone bright on Van Noten's round, immaculate runway. Billowed sleeves, deep necklines and colorful poppy prints livened up long, monastic dresses; classic coats and jackets were anything but boring thanks to quilted lapels, gathered sleeves and, in one case, a built-in trailing scarf.</p><p>Van Noten's accessories underscored the designer's unflinching sense of control. Eye-catching patent pumps, tall boots, fluoro heels and quirky leather caps all effortlessly complemented his airy looks.</p></div>"
41,fall,2001,f2001,emilio-pucci,"How did newly appointed Pucci designer Julio Espada tackle the task of reviving one of the world's most beloved, instantly recognizable labels? With a subtle touch, a modern approach and, above all, lots of respect for a legacy.</p><p>Espada reworked five of Pucci's quintessential swirling floral designs, but mixed them with sharp-cut solids that reflect an urban, practical sensibility. Innovations like a miniature mosaic grid print that creates a trompe-l'oeil tweed effect, a knit Fair Isle sweater with a traditional Pucci print pattern and side-button coats with turtleneck band collars all steered the collection clear of nostalgia.</p><p>Espada was successful in reestablishing Pucci as a name to follow, giving the clothes a contemporary spin while maintaining the house's commitment to elegance with details like bright silk linings, logo-engraved pearl buttons and, of course, the rich, vivid palette that made Emilio Pucci ""the prince of prints"" more than 30 years ago.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tcdr8c""></div></div><p>It will be interesting to see whether Espada will maintain these high standards while taking more daring risks in seasons to come.</p></div>"
42,fall,2001,f2001,emporio-armani,"There were no surprises at Emporio Armani—instead, plenty of the reliable, well-made and affordable basics we have come to expect.</p><p>Everyday pantsuits were loosely cut and sometimes trimmed with white piping; easy chinos were upgraded with a short mottled fur, and optic, geometric sweaters looked casual over shiny white pants. Not everything, however, was sensible day wear: Traditional blazers were spiced up when paired with teensy bikini tops, leather dresses were decorated with diagonal ruffles and paillette tops dazzled over striped trousers. Armani also offered a side-snap black coat with an off-kilter pocket, beaded jackets with floral motifs, shimmering evening slips and an array of black-velvet minidresses.</p></div>"
43,fall,2001,f2001,fendi,"It takes a talent like Karl Lagerfeld to channel 1960s street style, reinterpret it using only black and white, and get away with it.</p><p>Fendi's Fall mod squad stormed the runway in zip-up short furs, white leather trousers and perky minidresses with Courréges-like cutouts that revealed a circular flash of skin; large contrasting zippers served as functional embellishments that ran along the back. Black coats were piped in white, knit turtleneck tops morphed into little leather skirts and silver lapels gave white jackets a bold touch. Lagerfeld only strayed from his two-tone palette to show a couple of gray sheared-fur suits, and a <em>Space Odyssey</em>–silver dress that turned model Devon into a time-warping visitor from the future.</p><p>Accessories included strict Victorian brooches, flat patent- and ostrich-leather boots, and thick, metallic belts that will be among the season's most coveted items.</p></div>"
44,fall,2001,f2001,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré's designs walk the line between fashion and architecture, combining couturelike opulence with careful tailoring and construction.</p><p>Ferré played a game of extremes, mixing and matching dissonant styles. A fur-lined motorcycle jacket, for example, was thrown carelessly over a sharp gray-flannel suit. Pedestrian jeans were decorated with elaborate tartan brocades, masculine origami-style shirts were bound with black armbands and thick-wale corduroy was put at the service of strict lace-up corsets. Ferré's dramatic evening looks veered from tight tailcoats to silver coats with metallic embroidery à la Ziggy Stardust; organza hankies whipped into bouquet tops and gathered jersey dresses that followed the body's every curve.</p></div>"
45,fall,2001,f2001,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani continued to play a game of opposites, firm in his belief that strength and femininity go hand in hand.</p><p>Armani showed short blazers worn over fluid, lightweight trousers. Double-faced caban jackets were cut slightly off the shoulder to give them an informal air. Prince of Wales and striped overcoats hit the floor, emphasizing a fluid silhouette. Armani also showed small bodices paired with full, multitiered skirts and structured dress coats that billowed at the hem.</p><p>Eveningwear was an homage to Picasso's blue period, in varying shades of navy and shimmering with paillettes. Giant sequins glistened under layers of tulle, skirts were flounced and pleated, and raised embroidery decorated spaghetti-strapped tops.</p></div>"
46,fall,2001,f2001,gucci,"Tom Ford opened his show with sharp, narrow trousers and a fitted three-button jacket—the essential Gucci laid-back uniform—making it perfectly clear that mod silhouettes are a key influence for Fall.</p><p>Things got progressively interesting as multiple leather-trimmed zippers and large patch-pockets appeared on coats and pants; ruffled sheer pink tops softened the masculine tailoring, while yeti-like furs and massive lamb coats upped the glamour ante.</p><p>The overall effect of the collection was one of assured sexiness: Short satin dresses with asymmetric necklines, basic tuxedo jackets and skimpy capelets all looked sophisticated and easy to wear. Ford also kept his accessories strong and simple: Coppery ankle-strap heels and flat boots were enough to make a powerful statement.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hsle8n""></div></div><p>For evening, Ford showed a series of sheer lingerie slips with binding brassiere overlays that most women will find less than practical for real life; his square-cut ribbon dresses, equipped with a side zipper for easy escape, were far more arresting.</p></div>"
47,fall,2001,f2001,hamish-morrow,"Amid the many off-schedule shows of London fashion week, newcomer Hamish Morrow's small but extremely powerful presentation decidedly stood out. ""I wanted to explore how ideas in fashion are consumed and discarded at an alarming rate,"" says Morrow, who was recently appointed menswear designer for Fendi and who also consults for Louis Féraud. To get his point across, Morrow used flowers as a leitmotif for his collection, ""since they are fragile and exquisite, and have such a short life span."" Mind you, these were not your typical floral housedresses, which Morrow admittedly detests. Instead, canvas jackets were hand-painted by an artist friend and then embellished with black tulle appliqués that resembled a giant gothic carnation; form-fitting, sheer lace dresses were made out of four large panels cut like petals. ""I like to start with an abstract idea and eventually end up with clothes,"" explains Morrow, who also studded a black tweed and olive green suit with ""big, obnoxious crystal beads that cascade over the body.""</p><p>In contrast to the streetwise but often unpolished designs of other emerging designers, Morrow makes his point with meticulous attention to detail and couturelike workmanship instead of flashy gimmicks.</p></div>"
48,fall,2001,f2001,helmut-lang,"Die-hard fans of sleek power dressing will find plenty of sharp, no-nonsense basics at Helmut Lang come Fall. After Spring’s sex-driven tour de force, the Austrian designer has gone for a more sober approach, referencing some of his own early work in the process.</p><p>Lang’s mostly black collection revolved around many of his well-known classics: Fitted blazers, narrow trousers and sharp-edged coats continue to work as a modern urban uniform. Lang added some eye-catching touches like plush fur linings on overcoats, policeman-like holsters that curled around the shoulder on empire slips and beaded detailing that peeked out from the edge of liquid tops. Other highlights included sexy, off-kilter after-five dresses with only one sleeve and see-through tulle overlays.</p><p>Lang also showed several muted leopard-print suits and skimpy satin dresses with puzzling circular breast pads, but the more straightforward looks were far more commanding.</p></div>"
49,fall,2001,f2001,hermes,"“When we first met,” Martin Margiela said in a 2010 interview with <em>Grazia,</em> Jean-Louis Dumas “asked me anxiously if I was going to cut the Kelly in half because, at the time, the press used the words grunge and destroy to describe my work.” In fact, fashion’s leading deconstructionist was a preservationist at heart, one who was inspired to dismantle conceptions and seams in order to rebuild: “When I recut clothes, old or new,” he told <em>Vogue,</em> “it’s to transform them. It’s my way of bringing them back to life in another form.” At Hermès, what he dismantled was the need for conspicuous consumption by creating a wardrobe of such quality and adaptability that it obviated the need for (many) more clothes.</p><p>Though the surface markers of the old French house didn’t interest him at all, Margiela had a deep understanding of its soul: craftsmanship and fine materials. As a rule, he refused to create scarf prints, but he did apply the technique of hand-rolled seams to garment finishings, and, for 2001, he finally responded to the management’s plea for a scarf with the <em>losange.</em> Long and narrow, made of a solid color of monochrome silk twill crepe with contrasting edges, this was the scarf stripped bare—and all the better for it. It appeared throughout the Fall collection paired with sleeveless blouses and men’s suits for women. If the <em>losange</em> offered a taste of luxury, Margiela’s reverse kidskin “portés par deux” (layered double coats) delivered it in a great dollop. The icing on top? Matching cross-body muff bags.</p></div>"
50,fall,2001,f2001,icarius-de-menezes,"At 25, Brazilian designer Icarius de Menezes clearly has a talent for precise cutting, which is already obvious in both his flouncy, asymmetric gowns and sharp tailoring. After his debut Paris collection alluding to the gaudy excess of beauty pageants, de Menezes whipped up a heady combination of references for Fall: Fitted white coats and bomber jackets were livened up with a red armband or a dangling streamer; body-hugging jeans and bondage-inspired trousers stood in sharp contrast to his woolly gray suits and quasi-monastic, ethereal capes. Prints on smart blouses and dresses included everything from Hermès-like motifs to magazine images and iconic drawings. Icarius graduated from Brazil's increasingly important Santa Marcelina fashion school and briefly worked at <em>Brazilian Vogue</em> before decamping to the City of Light. ""São Paulo is becoming very important in terms of design,"" he says. ""But my big opportunity, for the moment, is in Paris.""</p></div>"
51,fall,2001,f2001,imitation-of-christ,"After a long day of back-to-back shows, the fashion flock trekked uptown to the Clearview Theaters on 66th Street, where Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, known as Imitation of Christ, showed their second collection, yet again full of spruced-up secondhand clothes, this time with a focus on archly flashy eveningwear.</p><p>How could they possibly follow up last season's funeral-parlor presentation? With a faux movie premiere. After being asked to make a charity donation to Sweatshop Watch and Free the Children, guests took their seats and watched live footage of models arriving to the theater for an imaginary premiere dressed as prom queens, party girls, giddy starlets, slinky old-school divas, '30s flappers and '80s good-time girls. After the good-time girls settled in the front rows, Subkoff and Damhave showed a short movie depicting the trials and tribulations of L.A.'s gilded youth (with a bit of philosophy and a suicide thrown in for good measure), featuring appearances by Élodie Bouchez, Reese Witherspoon, and Selma Blair. In a small corner of the screen, a documentary about the harsh working conditions in Central American free-trade zones was simultaneously presented.</p><p>What of the clothes, you ask? In Imitation of Christ's world, the question seems to be rather irrelevant.</p></div>"
52,fall,2001,f2001,jean-paul-gaultier,"The invitation to Jean Paul Gaultier's show offered the first clue of what was in store: It was a puzzle that crumbled in your hands as you opened the envelope.</p><p>The moment a soundtrack of cut-and-paste snippets of famous Prince tracks blared and two girls in slashed outfits hit the runway simultaneously, it all became clear: Gaultier was embracing bricollage.</p><p>Three-piece suits took on a whole new meaning on his runway. The bottom halves of jackets were hacked off and worn as miniskirts over matching trousers; detachable sleeves hung precariously by little fastenings at the shoulder. Not one to hold back, Gaultier unceremoniously relieved plush fur coats of their entire backsides; long evening gowns were also snipped, turning them into glamorous tank top-and-skirt combos. For those fearful of do-it-yourself endeavors, there were a couple of aged leather coats, plenty of sharp trousers and a substantial array of <em>Purple Rain</em> skirts and tops.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6xws6m""></div></div><p>""The idea was to make clothes that can be made as you want,"" exclaimed an exultant Gaultier after the show, in his distinctive brand of English.

53,fall,2001,f2001,jeremy-scott,"Forget about long, drawn-out conceptualism. In less than 10 minutes, Jeremy Scott managed to not only condense his entire aesthetic into one extravagant performance, but also to send an entire room of jaded editors into a collective roar of laughter.</p><p>When the curtains of Paris' Cirque d'Hiver were drawn, they revealed a revolving floor of glamorous TV game-show winners, done up to the nines in billowing dollar-bill outfits, plush logo-embossed furs, fitted designer jeans, sequined jumpsuits and zip-up jogging ensembles. The rouge-laden, important-haired celebutantes proudly displayed their hard-earned treasures: a stationary bicycle, a comfy reclining chair, a fabulous piano and, in the case of a less fortunate darling, a humble blender.</p><p>When the show ended, a second set of curtains opened and Scott, perched upon a fluffy cloud that would've made Jeff Koons proud, shared his wealth of mock $10,000 bills and chocolate gold coins with the audience—just like any bleach-blond, mullet-coiffed, modern-day Bob Barker would.</p></div>"
54,fall,2001,f2001,jil-sander,"After being made to stand in a huddle for over half an hour in the freezing Milanese drizzle, frazzled editors were finally squeezed through a wall of thuggish security guards and into the Jil Sander showroom.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wait was not particularly rewarding: Without its founding designer, Jil Sander has not yet managed to find its stride. Austere overcoats, blazers and sheath dresses blended together in a parade of black; a series of sheared fur jackets, burgundy velvet blazers and billowy trousers tucked into mannish boots could not alleviate the monotony. While there were a few smart dresses and all-purpose coats in the mix, it is clear that what Jil Sander the label misses desperately is, quite simply, Jil Sander the designer.</p></div>"
55,fall,2001,f2001,john-galliano,"John Galliano is certainly in great form this season, and we're not talking about his newly buff physique. After his triumphant Dior tour de force, Galliano showed an inventive, sophisticated and—dare we say it?—wearable collection for his signature label.</p><p>It all started with sporty elastic-waist plaid tracksuits and billowing blousons, superwide denim trousers, cargo pants and a sensational cropped, hooded puffy jacket. Things quickly moved along with warrior-princess dresses, massive army-green skirts with red detailing and ecru coats with floral cutout patterns. Galliano then allowed himself a series of precious soft-chiffon dresses with old English floral prints that called for a perfect cup of tea—and for fabulous flat boots that could've been made with the skin of a prehistoric reptile.</p><p>This season, Galliano has channeled his considerable creative energies into focused clothes that don't just stand out from the pack—they also work in the real world.</p></div>"
56,fall,2001,f2001,julien-macdonald,"With his gold cursive initials boldly hung over red curtains in the nouveau-posh party salon of London's Le Meridien Grosvenor House Hotel, Julien Macdonald let loose an unabashed display of fashion excess at its best, or worst, depending on one's point of view.</p><p>There's absolutely nothing subtle about Macdonald's rich-bitch aesthetic: Picture an avalanche of massive furs, leopard-printed, sexed-up vamp dresses with S&amp;M caps, dominatrix-inspired leather suits, sky-high diamond heels and sequined blazers that would make Ivana Trump look positively frumpy. As if to drive his point home, Macdonald also showed lavishly embroidered matador suits and a series of barely-there lingerie gowns that could've been plucked from a racier version of the Victoria's Secret catalog.</p><p>Did it work? Absolutely. Macdonald's clothes are clearly not for everyone (Pamela Anderson and Miss Venezuela come to mind as potential customers), but the over-the-top performance was a jolt of pure fun.</p></div>"
57,fall,2001,f2001,katayone-adeli,"For the last couple of years, Katayone Adeli has been quietly cultivating a devoted following of in-the-know girls who cherish her super-slim pants and trendy tops, so it was no surprise to find Christy Turlington and Famke Janssen avidly checking off looks on their programs as the show progressed.</p><p>Adeli has successfully tapped into the need for clothes that retain an air of romantic sensuality but are imbued with a street-smart edge. In her hands, a train on an indigo-blue dress becomes a chic accessory that can be toyed with while sipping a martini, then pinned to the waist when it's time to face reality and fetch a taxi. Her leather jackets are paneled and sliced, creating an effect that's both tough and delicate; pencil skirts are ruched at the seams and paired with lacy shirts with turquoise sequin details half-hidden at the shoulder. Adeli is proving that she has some savvy tricks up her sleeve, reworking traditional notions of femininity into sexy, functional looks that are relevant to a young, urban generation of women.</p></div>"
58,fall,2001,f2001,kenzo,"""Romantic rock"" was Gilles Rosier's point of reference for Kenzo's exploration of hard-edged, dramatic silhouettes.</p><p>Rosier distilled many of the prevailing trends of the season and assembled them in a pastiche of brooding suits, pegged trousers, pleated and voluminous skirts, drop-waist jackets and flat-ankle booties.</p><p>Acknowledging the house's tradition of mixing and matching ethnic references, Rosier also showed a series of Middle Eastern-inspired prints and dainty floral appliqués that at times got lost in the mix. While several individual pieces will work fine on their own, the collection failed to create a lasting impression. The Kenzo label still has ground to cover in order to develop a strong and relevant image for today.</p></div>"
59,fall,2001,f2001,krizia-top,"Seeking to modernize their company and create a more fashion-forward image, Krizia hired Belgian designer Jean-Paul Knott. Knott, who took the reins of Krizia's most upscale line from Alber Elbaz, had previously worked for over a decade with Yves Saint Laurent.</p><p>Knott succeeded in putting Krizia Top on the map with a modern, sometimes overly enthusiastic aesthetic. Off-the-shoulder oversize sweaters, tight leather skirts, satin shirtdresses and plunging-neck chemises all oozed sexiness. Long rubber stockings tiptoed the fetishistic line, but provided a happy solution for those who crave open-toe mules and miniskirts in the dead of winter. Knott also indulged in a few skirts with a massive side buckle, which consisted essentially of fabric drawn through a giant square and then draped around the hips. More classically chic options included an impeccable camel coat, several sharp pantsuits and a series of matte sequin dresses that looked absolutely elegant and modern without trying too hard.</p></div>"
60,fall,2001,f2001,lanvin,"Cristina Ortiz went for a tougher-than-usual feeling at Lanvin, restricting her palette to black, navy blue and off-white.</p><p>To a rock-and-roll soundtrack, Ortiz sent out long coats with half-hidden belts, low-button mannish jackets, teensy black dresses with side slits and blazers with upturned, silver-studded lapels. Ortiz was intent on making a statement with sheer fabrics, unexpected cutouts and dramatic details like neck bands that trailed down the arm and reattached themselves at the cuff.</p><p>Her experiments often worked well. A petrol-blue trench was striking, and several minidresses looked sharp and sexy. On the other hand, some of Ortiz's slashed tops and self-consciously punky looks seemed a bit forced and contrived. The clean, simple silhouettes worked best.</p></div>"
61,fall,2001,f2001,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele clearly feels right at home in a season dominated by chromatic extremes; his no-frills collection was done almost exclusively in black and white. But that's not to say that it was all about bare-bones minimalism—instead, Steele played up a naive, if somewhat perverse, girl-wants-to-be-a-grown-up look.</p><p>How else to explain black, above-the-knee pleated leather skirts with a white-trimmed sailor top, Girl Scout foulards over liquid minisheaths and Empire-waist playground dresses with gathered short sleeves? Delicate ribbons trimmed fitted pullovers, Bermuda shorts loosened up severe blazers and pearl buttons adorned classic pea coats.</p><p>Steele's only concession to color came in the form of a couple of gently ruffled, sheer off-the-shoulder tops worn with black-velvet skirts, black stockings and patent double-bow Mary Janes. Add a plush black fur and you're ready to go—after all, even the nicest girls need a bit of mischief sometimes.</p></div>"
62,fall,2001,f2001,loewe,"Narciso Rodriguez took his final bow as Loewe's designer today in order to concentrate on his newly revamped signature line.</p><p>Rodriguez waved <em>adios</em> to the Spanish luxury-leather house with plenty of the strong, graphic—and saleable—clothes with which he put the label on the fashion map. There was nothing superfluous about his brief, to-the-point collection, executed in black, white and silver. Fitted leather shells toughened up flimsy georgette slip-skirts; wrap jackets and gabardine coats were tightly bound at the waist; a couple of leather coats flirted with an Empire silhouette. Metal-studded shifts looked feminine and chic rather than punky.</p><p>Rodriguez closed his show with absolutely clean white jersey-and-crepe evening skirts, flyaway tops and a couple of sequin dresses that would put a giant disco ball to shame.</p></div>"
63,fall,2001,f2001,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs delivered yet another impeccable collection for Louis Vuitton today, once again raising the ante for designers in Paris.</p><p>Jacobs acknowledged the predominantly black, moody aesthetic that has been so prevalent this season but gave it a sophisticated, playful spin that was nothing short of joyful. His felted cavalry twill coats and suits were hard and sexy—but also sweet, thanks to puffs of mink that served as buttons. Jacobs' silk jersey Empire dresses were miles ahead of the pack, relying solely on modest polka dots and precise cut for effect. His denim jeans with tiny gold zipper pulls at the pockets will bring quiet luxury to the street. Tone-on-tone plaid dresses and efficient little robes with colorful optic insets referenced mod classics but felt absolutely fresh and original.</p><p>Evening was also impeccable. Mink pom-pom T-shirts were effortlessly chic; velvet dresses and translucent silk jersey tunics were simultaneously cool and grown-up, especially when worn with high cordovan side-lace boots that are sure to become one of Fall's must-have accessories.</p></div>"

Channeling early ’70s English street style, Bartley showed tiny denim dungaree dresses, drainpipe jeans, frayed miniskirts and oversize men’s jackets. Striped shirts with matching ties, mohair duffle coats and massive bombers in suede and sheepskin showed that skinheads can appreciate a bit of luxury as much as anyone else. Accessories included massive denim patent-strap bags; all looks were shown with classic Dr. Martens combat boots.</p><p>Bartley may not be at the forefront of innovation, but her well thought-out, carefully planned collection scored plenty of hits and provided a strong conclusion to a sometimes dreary Milanese fashion calendar.</p></div>"
65,fall,2001,f2001,maison-martin-margiela,"Forget rose petals. For his Fall ’01 show, Margiela chose a location in a tunnel under Paris’s Pont Alexandre III. Models wore rock tees, thigh-high boots, silken men’s robes, and fringed dresses. It was one of his most street-inflected collections ever.</p></div>"
66,fall,2001,f2001,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Marc Jacobs is on a roll. A mere 18 hours after presenting his sophisticated and mature signature collection, the globe-trotting designer went for lightning-speed street smarts at Marc—and it worked like a charm.</p><p>Wallflowers, beware: To a blaring soundtrack by the Cure, Jacobs' girls stormed the runway wearing super-tight, faded and striped jeans, fitted military overcoats, graffiti-printed sweats and T-shirts, flocked miniskirts and no-nonsense olive parkas.</p><p>It's the kind of look that has made headlines in London for the last few seasons, but Jacobs added preppy elements to the mix, like varsity bomber jackets, rugby shirts, skinny ties and corduroy jackets, all layered haphazardly. Even the girliest clothes—cherry-print ruffle skirts, wool felt school blazers and a floral peplum dress—looked modern and tough when worn with triple-layered elastic belts and chunky ankle booties.</p></div>"
67,fall,2001,f2001,marc-jacobs,"Gone were all of Spring’s campy, sugar-coated references to the clubby ’80s at Marc Jacobs. In their stead, Jacobs went for quirkily tailored clothes that gently touched upon—and promptly subverted—fashion’s recurring ladylike motifs with playful details and an unforced spirit of innocence.</p><p>With a knowing wink to Patrick Kelly, that other famous American Francophile, Jacobs gave a lively twist to his boiled-twill suits, silk jackets, and cashmere coats using oversized, childlike buttons. The effect was that of a young girl trying on her older sister’s clothes, yet somehow making them all her own. Colorful trompe l’oeil lapels, ribbons, collars, and trims on simple georgette tops and dresses all added to the general feeling of naive elegance. With bunny-and-flower-print dresses and a stunning yellow mohair and sequin coat, Jacobs provided welcome relief from the self-consciously glammed-up evening looks that dominate most runways.</p></div>"
68,fall,2001,f2001,marjan-pejoski,"In an increasingly corporate fashion climate, Marjan Pejoski seems to be intent on just having fun. This season he turned his rose-strewn runway into a dramatic fashion aviary.</p><p>Pejoski's clothes are not exactly everyday basics—unless your idea of a go-anywhere look is a pair of fur hot pants, high boots and a bat-sleeved, wide-knit sweater with a gigantic beaded peacock appliqué. Other options included a giant net top with dangling trompe l'oeil plumage, and a bodysuit embellished with a feathery creature whose generous wingspan somehow failed to conceal the wearer's breasts. How to top off the madness? Consider an ostrichlike creation with a long neck and head that needed to be constantly held up, or Pejoski's closing outfit, which literally turned Alek Wek into a dazzling swan.</p></div>"
69,fall,2001,f2001,markus-lupfer,"Combining the best of Britain's creative energy with a self-assured sense of control, Markus Lupfer is fast becoming one of London's most important designers.</p><p>Relying on precise tailoring and a stunning sense of color, Lupfer brought to life classic wardrobe staples and gave them a modern, subtly edgy twist. Simple turtlenecks and crewnecks in primary yellow, red and blue looked fresh and youthful with ribbon-front, pleated and layered skirts; masculine jackets were softened with draped lapels then paired with flat-front trousers; cocktail dresses relied only on a slight side cinch for a shot of swagger. Lupfer's fitted corduroy jeans and body-conscious bomber jackets were full of attitude, but his shiny, printed shift dresses looked sweet and elegant. Accessories included bright, see-through plastic belts that neatly tied together his structured looks.</p></div>"
70,fall,2001,f2001,marni,"In a season marked by an absence of color, Marni designer Consuelo Castiglione bucked the all-black trend and delivered the type of sentimental yet modern clothes that will provide a welcome alternative for women who crave a romantic touch.</p><p>There was nothing heavy about Castiglione's papery dresses with loose ties, embroidered wrap skirts and flower-appliqué coats. Instead of the tight, vampy miniskirts that have taken over many runways, Castiglione showed flowing A-lines with pretty marigold prints, boxy and comfortable jackets with colorful square patterns, and lightweight, comfortable V-neck sweaters. Contrasting leather sashes, dark stockings and large circular totes worked wonderfully, though the Japanese-inspired wooden shoes Castiglione used may not be for everyone. For evening there were antique-looking dresses with distressed straps, beaded inlays and multiple see-through layers, as well as a striking champagne skirt.</p></div>"
71,fall,2001,f2001,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon's opening looks—a long, dark, loose overcoat thrown over straight pants, a military jacket and a wrap skirt with a sexy corset—announced that we were in for another rendition of the masculine/feminine play of opposites that has been so prevalent this season.</p><p>Sitbon did it well. Leather skirts with lace insets on the side, pert blazers with puffed shoulders, and safari jackets with patch pockets will be functional and eye-catching additions to any wardrobe. Dresses with spider-web embroideries, distressed sides, and tulle and paillette layers were simultaneously flirty and stone-hard. Less interesting were the red-and-black printed cocktail numbers (which came and went without leaving a lasting impression) and the overly revealing lingerie slips.</p><p>Still, as a whole, Sitbon's collection offered plenty of strong clothes that are perfectly practical yet manage to stand out from the pack.</p></div>"
72,fall,2001,f2001,matthew-williamson,"""Wonderland"" was the working title for Matthew Williamson's whirlpool of rainbow sequins, lace, mesh and fur.</p><p>Contrary to fashion's current mood of pared-down chic, Williamson showed a large selection of paillette-encrusted skirts, tops with glittery messages such as ""Drink Me,"" ruched gold clam-diggers, and cropped sweatshirts and miniskirts with shiny embroidered playing cards. There were also puzzling Playboy bunny-like leather aprons, miniature furs, ravaged tulle skirts, Jackson Pollock-inspired paint-splattered dresses, and a couple of red coats with a ladylike bow that looked lost amidst the sea of over-the-top decoration. Some of Williamson's pieces will add a whimsical and extravagant touch to staid wardrobes, but as a whole the collection seemed oddly out of sync with the fashion moment.</p></div>"
73,fall,2001,f2001,michael-kors-collection,"After Michael Kors' bold take on country luxe, there's little doubt that equestrian chic will be a recurring theme next Fall. Kors may have been inspired by life on the farm, but there was nothing rough-edged or dowdy about his thoroughbred looks. Riding britches were turned into lean, mean trousers that could be tucked into tall leather boots or worn with double-buckle boyish shoes; cashmere Aran sweaters and bright marigold, kelly green and scarlet turtlenecks looked divine under sinful, double-faced blanket coats to the floor.</p><p>Kors kept his collection sharply in focus by consistently emphasizing contrasts: Dramatic capes flowed over skinny jodhpurs and mini-shifts while crisp, colorful piping gave an architectural edge to everything from quilted field skirts to practical leather jackets. The recurring play of opposites was especially successful with the evening looks: A long, beaded bronze lace skirt looked perfect with a casual turtleneck and sporty suede jacket; an ivory sweater coat unceremoniously framed a shimmering evening gown.</p><p>It takes considerable talent and experience to pull off such a collection without stumbling onto a minefield of overworked references. It's no coincidence that this Fall marks Michael Kors' 20th anniversary of designing casual yet utterly luxurious clothes.</p></div>"
74,fall,2001,f2001,miguel-adrover,"When most people travel abroad they bring back pictures, postcards, and perhaps a trinket or two from the local tourist traps. Miguel Adrover and his creative director, Sebastian Pons, spent six weeks in Egypt, lived with a family in the countryside for 24 days, and returned to New York with enough inspiration for a full-fledged Middle Eastern collection.</p><p>Adrover’s Egyptian jaunt, which was staged in an incense-drenched market-turned-tent, included everything from floor-length caftans and coats worn with turbans and chadors to blazers with harem pants and jodhpurs, layered printed tunics and jet-black robes. Adrover also sent out several nomads carrying large packages on their heads, strict military cadets, colonial-era emissaries, and a shepherdess who was left sans sheep when the fluffy creature refused to take to the runway.</p><p>Some may argue that few women will want to wear endless layers of earth-sweeping gowns for everyday life. But it’s a pleasure to confirm that fashion is not always just about stilettos and tarty see-through tops. Those who absolutely insist on practicality can simply pass on Adrover’s more fanciful looks and concentrate on the chic trousers, smart skirts, plaid jackets and ruffled dresses that will work perfectly well in any cosmopolitan environment.</p></div>"
75,fall,2001,f2001,missoni,"Perhaps taking a cue from last season's obsession with corseted, wrapped and strapped silhouettes, Missoni toyed with a more overtly adventurous feeling than usual this season, with decidedly mixed results.</p><p>The house's well-known staples were all there: Roomy tweed trousers, long zig-zag print coats and colorful turtlenecks all looked great, as did a pale-blue corduroy pantsuit and a floor-grazing trench. Patchwork-inlaid coats, jackets and skirts added a playful spin to Missoni's traditional play of patterns. Less successful were the whalebone-cinched tops, strappy optic dresses and oversize patent-leather trousers; and the intriguing double bag designed to dangle perilously over the shoulder is a pickpocket's dream come true.</p><p>What worked best at Missoni were the looks that relied on classic design and well-assembled colors and textures for effect.</p></div>"
76,fall,2001,f2001,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada reworked at Miu Miu many of the themes she presented in her signature collection, giving them a light-hearted, dreamy feeling.</p><p>The countercultural, '50s-inspired girls of last season have now moved on to the '60s, and are wearing sheer lingerie slips, sleeveless wool shifts, short capes with front pockets and double-breasted boiled-wool minicoats. Like their more mature cousins at Prada, Miu Miu enthusiasts love black—but they can also add plenty of color to their mod look with flower-printed robes and little Empire-waisted dresses in bright green and red. Sharp denim jackets, pleated skirts and straight jeans work perfectly with crinkly cotton shirts as a hip city uniform.</p><p>Miu Miu's accessories always tie the looks together. In this case, black stockings, cracked-leather Mary Janes and low-slung tan bags all looked polished yet slightly worn—as if a fashion-savvy gamine had rifled through her mother's closet, borrowing all the right stuff.</p></div>"
77,fall,2001,f2001,moschino,"One can always count on Moschino for a good romp; playing up stereotypes with sarcastic humor is one of the label's signature touches. From the moment a sexy chambermaid stepped onto the catwalk bearing a bottle of wine and wearing an apron and a dress that said ""Maid in Italy,"" it was clear that this was no ordinary show.</p><p>A troupe of sleepy, fresh-out-of-bed housewives followed—wearing pajamalike satin camisole dresses, a pink fur bathroom robe, hair curlers and sleeping masks. Once dressed, our friends proved to be everything from gingham-clad cleaning ladies, to flower-drenched good girls, to on-the-go businesswomen. What followed was a play on fashion's current obsession with masculine and feminine roles: Girls dressed up as schoolboys, and gangsters and military cadets all turned up with their belles in tow.</p><p>There were no major fashion revelations, but Moschino provided an hour of kitschy fun that offered relief from the overly serious and self-conscious mood that has dominated the week.</p></div>"
78,fall,2001,f2001,narciso-rodriguez,"Anyone who has felt New York fashion week needed a shot of fresh energy will be glad to know that Narciso Rodriguez is back to stay after his extended Milanese stint.</p><p>Rodriguez showed one of his strongest collections in seasons, relying on deft tailoring, clean lines and meticulous attention to detail. A double-layered cotton and wool shift hugged the body and offered a peek-a-boo hint of red piping at the seams; tuxedo trousers were paired with a layered T-shirt, limpid button-down and stretch-wool jumper, all with the sleeves hacked off. A red fox coat appeared sumptuous and rich, yet faintly savage—think of the look as tough chic.</p><p>Rodriguez’s evening dresses hinted at the loose, light silhouette of the 1920s, but there was nothing retro about his dangling chains and Swarovski crystals, metallic belts and stretch wool overlays. With his short, highly focused collection, Rodriguez proved that a few well-executed ideas are far more compelling and newsworthy than predictable gimmicks and flash-in-the-pan trends.</p></div>"
79,fall,2001,f2001,olivier-theyskens,"As if to prove once and for all that he is up to the task of designing for Givenchy or any other major fashion house, <a href=""https://www.vogue.com/tag/designer/olivier-theyskens"">Olivier Theyskens</a> presented what was undoubtedly one of the strongest, most brilliant collections of the season.</p><p>With an unerring sense of proportion and color, the Belgian designer showed massive coats that folded upon themselves to become a skirt. A gigantic violet pouf was worn with a wide-knit black cardigan. His all-in-one tweed skirt-and-coat combo was a veritable feat of engineering. Theyskens’ poetic experiments did not end there: Knit fur jackets were backed with colorful linings to match their metallic buttons; an imperious strapless white dress came with a fur inset and a sweeping train.</p><p>Theyskens lightened his presentation with boxy black suits, skinny white trousers and little mint-julep dresses, proving that he can also create impeccable clothes for everyday life.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""uc377r""></div></div><p>What else could he possibly show in under 20 minutes? How about sexy, shiny underwear that’s far too fabulous to be worn in private, or sculptured heels with a coy bump in the back? Clearly, Theyskens is anything but short of ideas.</p></div>"
80,fall,2001,f2001,oscar-de-la-renta,"With a palette centered mainly around black and white, Oscar de la Renta offered a more somber take than usual on his frothy classics, but still provided a wide range of stylistic options for his faithful clientele.</p><p>For lunch at Swifty's, there were salt-and-pepper tweed suits, gently flared skirts to the knee, and wool coats with fur collars and prim leather bow belts. De la Renta's vision of casual luxury also included cashmere and boiled wool cardigan jackets, ruffled silk charmeuse blouses and even a sexy, youthful fuchsia shearling mini. Evening took a turn for the dramatic with beaded and feathered slipdresses, tapestry-print velvet trousers and gowns, and a couple of decidedly gothic black opera coats. Some of these looks will prove overwhelming for many, but steadfast Oscar fans will still be able to find plenty of their favorite ruffled skirts and sexy halter tops.</p><p>Shoe and bag fetishists will be delighted to know that de la Renta launched his signature line of accessories this season, including diamond-buckled pumps, satin slingbacks, embroidered boots and hard-frame crocodile cases.</p></div>"
81,fall,2001,f2001,pierrot,"Sometimes it takes an outsider's eye to appreciate the nuances of America. After designing Miguel Adrover's knitwear for two seasons (who can forget the breathtaking spider-web shawls?), Frenchman Pierrot has brought a Midwest backwoods aesthetic to his runway.</p><p>Inspired by his frequent visits to rural Michigan, Pierrot (né Pierre Carrilero) designed an all-knit collection that includes camouflaged hunting bodysuits, coats with dangling furry tails, a sweater that reads ""The Right to Bear Arms,"" and several Native-American-inspired ensembles. Not one to skimp on details, Pierrot also covered his New York runway with autumn leaves, interspersed a rubber animal or two among the models, and provided a stunning photo-panel forest backdrop.</p><p>In contrast to the sometimes predictable and commercially oriented Bryant Park collections, Pierrot's performance stood out as one of the truly enjoyable and original highlights of fashion week.</p></div>"
82,fall,2001,f2001,prada,"The hard-edged, almost austere look that Miuccia Prada recently championed has clearly become a major influence this season, so it's not surprising that her Fall collection continued to push forth a no-nonsense, pared-down aesthetic.</p><p>Working almost exclusively in dark gray, black and brown, Prada reworked some of the looks that first made Carnaby Street chic. Fur-trimmed, paneled coats with geometric fastenings worn over skintight leggings brought to mind a nouvelle Twiggy, as did the coquettish minidresses with bright orange trim. Steering clear of superficial connotations, Prada made sure to keep her collection varied. For every mod shift there was a long, pleated skirt, a flowing Empire-waist prairie robe or a smart capelet. A couple of copper-and-white swirl dresses, a plush everyday fur and several impeccable jackets spoke of understated cool, as did her all-important accessories. Patent Mary Janes and tall lace-up granny boots were worn with thick stockings, while enormous tan bags with extra-long straps swung nonchalantly at the hip.</p><p>By veering away from excessive decoration and facile status references, Prada succeeded in creating a perfectly fashionable anti-fashion wardrobe.</p></div>"
83,fall,2001,f2001,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"""Why is it all these girls look so soft and I look so hard?"" asked a voice-over on Preen's runway soundtrack. The rhetorical question was a perfect allusion to Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi's deftly manipulated collection.</p><p>Preen's clothes are clearly meant to stand out: Slouch tweed pants were paired with windowpane button-downs with gathered or ballooned sleeves creating the top-heavy silhouette that remained a constant throughout the collection. Thornton and Bregazzi are known for their way with hides, and this time around they went for cream leather asymmetric skirts with button-encrusted sashes; a suede jacket was generously ruffled at the side, while trousers were cut perilously low; a series of cropped fur tops brought to mind a defiantly chic cave woman. As if all this wasn't enough to make quite a statement, Preen's embellishments included dangling beaded lace appliqué's, jangles of rosaries, stitched-on buttons, and giant rosettes that trailed in the back of skirts.</p></div>"
84,fall,2001,f2001,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren tapped into fashion's current need for simplicity, referencing equestrian uniforms and making them relevant for modern urban life.</p><p>Lauren's fine-gauge cashmere turtlenecks, lush cable sweaters, cavalry twill pants, textured crocodile belts and plaid jackets with leather elbow patches will work perfectly for a casual lunch date or a weekend getaway to Greenwich, Conn. Supple espresso leather shirtdresses, fitted chocolate suede pants and generously ruffled shirts also looked practical and smart, as did the short, easygoing georgette cocktail slips lavished with beaded paisleys.</p><p>For evening, Lauren segued into long, rich velvet skirts and floor-length strapless gowns, but the real show-stoppers were a series of tuxedos that could be worn with an ivory silk shirt, a short string of diamonds, or nothing at all. As Lauren stated in his show program: ""It's thoroughbred dressing at its newest and most chic.""</p></div>"
85,fall,2001,f2001,richard-edwards,"Women who secretly raided their boyfriends' wardrobes in search of sharp-cut Richard Edwards trousers and blazers will be delighted to know that the duo have debuted a womenswear line for Fall 2001. Clean lines and an all-American feel are still the design mantra for Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick, who first teamed up in 1995 to create a small but effective line of men's clothes.</p><p>Sleek pencil skirts and trousers were worn with asymmetric wrap shirts, impeccable jackets and gathered-front turtlenecks; leather tops with ruched waistbands looked strong and sexy. Subtle details like gently gathered lapels that created a foulard-like effect on classic coats gave the collection a touch of whimsy and saved it from straying toward the conventional. Easygoing pleated dresses, an assortment of shiny knockout suits and several fabulous tomato ensembles promise that Richard Edwards will make quite a splash with Manhattan's no-nonsense power-dressers.</p></div>"
86,fall,2001,f2001,richard-tyler,"Guests were unceremoniously squeezed into a packed glass hothouse in New York's West Village for Richard Tyler's presentation of attention-grabbing couture.</p><p>Tyler's considerable tailoring skills were most apparent on a sculpted leather blazer with pointed shoulders, a pearl crepe coat with a pleated side panel, and a mannish sharkskin suit worn with a shiny button-down and matching tie. Short, pintucked empire-waist slips kept the mood light, proving that evening dressing is not always synonymous with floor-length.</p><p>While Tyler's chiffon strapless gowns, distressed embroideries and playful fringes brought to mind the carefree silhouette of the '20s, at times his enthusiasm took a turn for the excessive. A final parade of corseted dresses, deconstructed tuxedos and skimpy teddies would have made quite a splash at a Playboy mansion reception.</p></div>"
87,fall,2001,f2001,roberto-cavalli,"So much for minimalism! To say that Roberto Cavalli's show was over the top is a moot point; the designer has built his reputation precisely around his larger-than-life point of view.</p><p>The Victorian Age and Aspen in the '60s were the abstract sources of inspiration for Cavalli's pelts-and-plumage fest, which included enormous shearlings, lush lynxes and imposing feather chokers. Cavalli took a break from his hunting extravaganza with equally lavish, ravaged tapestry ensembles, beaded acid-wash denim, deer-and-eagle-printed dresses and several fitted pantsuits.</p><p>Who exactly will wear Cavalli's ode to excess? Lil' Kim and friends are a good start—but as the designer emerged from backstage, pipe in hand, for his lengthy bow, he was surrounded by a procession of girls in skimpy, somewhat more accessible versions of his outrageous dresses. Still, proceed with caution.</p></div>"
88,fall,2001,f2001,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret can always be counted on for plenty of old-school sex appeal; he can turn a few yards of fabric into a show-stopping, ultra-sexy cocktail dress with just a pinch and a tuck.</p><p>In keeping with his reputation, Mouret showed plenty of dramatic, body-skimming tops held together by nothing more than a leather rosette; goddess dresses were suspended by only a piece of glittery adhesive tape. If you can't quite picture yourself taking the subway at rush hour wearing a satin handkerchief, you'll be glad to know that there were also sensible fitted jeans and skirts with leather inlays, and a couple of tuxedolike suits and jackets.</p><p>In a world of increasingly homogenous dressing, Mouret has clearly carved out a distinctive niche for himself. Still, one wishes he would explore new territory—at times his collection was simply repetitive, and it didn't help matters that many pieces were embellished with the same glitter-trimmed holes as last season.</p></div>"
89,fall,2001,f2001,ruffo-research,"Once again Ruffo Research managed to inject a powerful dose of street smarts into an otherwise conventional Milanese fashion week.</p><p>Sophia Kokosalaki’s second and final collection for the well-known leather house gave a lesson in strong femininity. Chocolate-suede dresses edged in black leather looked simultaneously sweet and deathly cool; savage-looking braided straps, odd bits of tulle and featherlike tufts of goat skin gave a primitive edge to perfectly cut tops. But Kokosalaki also proved that she can go for classic design—with an edge, of course. Her long leather coat stands out miles from the pack thanks to a simple diagonal row of buttons; a black leather blazer is decorated with a trompe-l'oeil lapel trim, and a sharp skirt reveals a teardrop of skin at the hips. Kokosalaki also scored a hit with several divine sheared shearling coats that put the softest of furs to shame.</p><p>With its sharp eye for recognizing and nurturing new talent, Ruffo Research is proving to be not only a powerful innovator in Italian fashion, but also a key label for insiders.</p></div>"
90,fall,2001,f2001,russell-sage,"""I need money!"" said Russell Sage to his sponsor, the bank Britannic Money, who generously obliged with 10,000 pounds. The designer promptly stitched the bills into stunning rosettes on a skirt, jacket and dress. ""It's a way to comment on the economic struggles that many designers face, and also make a statement about the value of fashion,"" said Sage. ""One of my dresses is made out of 6,000 pounds. But is it worth more than that?""</p><p>We certainly think so. Sage's collection played out brilliantly, turning not only bank notes but recovered antique fabrics and even a common blanket into modern, off-kilter wonders. Linen jackets came with hand-painted details, lace insets peeked out of shirts, and a damask tablecloth became a skirt; think of it as Portobello Market chic. Sage believes that each and every one of his pieces has an important history behind it, which the buyer can make his own. As if to prove his point, he closed the show with a striking, delicately beaded white dress made out of his own mother's wedding gown, which Sage brought back to life after it had been stored for over 40 years.</p></div>"
91,fall,2001,f2001,saint-laurent,"Working almost exclusively in black, Tom Ford took confident steps toward defining his vision for Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche.</p><p>A couple of pink-and-amethyst short dresses trimmed in waffle pleats opened the show; from that moment on, Ford's only concession to color was a deep aubergine tone that surfaced sporadically.</p><p>The monochromatic scheme forced the audience to focus on the design of the clothes. Saint Laurent's famous gypsies migrated to the new millennium, their fringed skirts and off-the-shoulder peasant dresses intact but updated for urban life. Ford also provided an impressive array of fitted jackets with ruffled lapels, leader-of-the-band coats, sumptuous shearlings and stern military overcoats with epaulettes and thick belts.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gmonww""></div></div><p>The precise focus of Ford's collection extended to the accessories: The new YSL Rive Gauche thick-heeled, wide-strap heels, no-nonsense boots and graphic rectangular cases should be flying off the shelves next fall.</p></div>"
92,fall,2001,f2001,shelley-fox,"Shelley Fox has clearly understood that a strong silhouette can speak far louder than the self-consciously dramatic statements that overeager young designers sometimes feel compelled to make.</p><p>Fox's collection revolved around full-cut skirts worn over tulle layers, strict jackets with unexpected volumes and off-kilter dresses. Matte leather skirts were done in strong, graphic colors and paired with simple black tops; a shift dress, utterly devoid of embellishments, had one of its straps snapped in two; a copper top was fitted to the body, its ballooned sleeves slit at the side. Fox also showed a series of chunky knits and pale sweaters that carried through her message of relaxed, casual chic.</p></div>"
93,fall,2001,f2001,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel occupies her own fabulous fashion universe, which at times casually overlaps with the one in which the majority of mortals reside.</p><p>For fall, Rykiel's world is made up of pegged shiny trousers and colorful sweaters decorated with rhinestone trims, beaded fruit motifs and glittery messages like ""temptation."" Gold zippers crisscross otherwise conventional wool blazers, and short jersey dresses reveal geometric panels of skin through graphic cutouts. Rykiel's fox and raccoon chubby coats most closely resemble a wearable cloud dyed violet, yellow or rust—and they look sensational.</p><p>Naturally, her eveningwear couldn't possibly make less of a statement: Transparent lace cardigans and skirts with knit trims, frilly polka-dotted frocks and asymmetric pearl satin dresses evoke found treasures from a madcap vintage store.</p></div>"
94,fall,2001,f2001,sophia-kokosalaki,"Greek-born Sophia Kokosalaki left little doubt that she is here to stay as one of London's most promising young designers.</p><p>Kokosalaki continued to refine many of her signature themes—dresses and tops were painstakingly pleated and draped, then bound with leather bands and grommet straps to create a look that is both classically feminine and unflinchingly hard-core. But the big news in her Fall collection was the more austere tuxedo suits, straight trousers, piped overcoats and straight skirts, which relied only on precision of cut and subtle details like tone-on-tone piping for effect.</p><p>Subtle mixes of olive, tan and brown referenced military uniforms; a series of salmon, red and black dresses showed that, with only a few collections under her belt, Kokosalaki already has distinctive style and a highly developed and original sense of color.</p></div>"
95,fall,2001,f2001,strenesse,"Brave journalists rose with the sun (or rather, the Milanese fog) on Sunday morning in order to catch Strenesse's early-bird presentation.</p><p>Designer Gabriele Strehle showed a short, sparse collection that neatly encapsulated her minimalist approach to fashion. Using only gray, cream and black, Strehle sent out round-collar and double-lapel coats, girly Empire-waist dresses, schoolgirl cardigans, blousy tops and high-waist gathered-front skirts with double hems and delicate underlays—the type of clothes that a woman who believes in simple yet sophisticated dressing will love. Prehistoric-looking shearling coats and jackets added an edgy touch just as the looks veered toward the monotonous.</p><p>Strehle also went for the current lingerie-as-eveningwear trend—her sheer beige gathered slips with high double belts looked flirty and feminine, but never vulgar.</p></div>"
96,fall,2001,f2001,thimister,"Josephus Thimister’s show invitation announced that the designer was “back in action” after a six-month sabbatical.</p><p>Thimister celebrated by covering the floor of the Bataclan music hall with white carnations, which were promptly stomped on by rigid girls in military-inspired trenchcoats, tight pencil skirts and lace-up ankle booties. He then went on to experiment with long fur skirts, leather coats with pointy shoulders, rough-cut tops with little capes in the back, putty leather suits and snakeskin jackets.</p><p>Thimister’s main strength has always been his self-assured sense of direction, but this collection failed to present important new ideas. Still, it’s very welcome news that Thimister is once again in business; hopefully by next season he will have fully regained his stride.</p></div>"
97,fall,2001,f2001,trussardi,"Founded in 1910 as an upscale glove manufacturer, the Trussardi label always brings to mind old-school workmanship and classic elegance.</p><p>Having said that, the house is also visibly out of sync with the fashion moment. For Fall, Trussardi suggests a variety of leather-trimmed calfskin coats, suede shirts with awkwardly twisted button closures and half-velvet/half-suede cocktail numbers. Some pieces, like the thin turtlenecks, sharp leather skirts and little punched-suede dresses, will work fine as luxurious staples. But others, including blazers and wool dresses with calfskin insets, simply fall flat.</p><p>At a time when traditional labels are turning to a new generation of global-minded designers for inspiration, Trussardi could benefit from a similar jolt of adrenaline.</p></div>"
98,fall,2001,f2001,tuleh,"An imposing chandelier and dazzling cases of diamonds served as the backdrop for Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley's ""Americouture"" presentation of made-to-order designs at Harry Winston.</p><p>By all accounts, it was a stellar evening. Virtually every look that came down the runway was embellished with constellations of eye-catching stars—from the black-and-violet ruffle-trimmed leather coat that opened the show to the tone-on-tone embossed tuxedo, fly-away gypsy dresses, satin jeans and heavily beaded skirts. Things took a turn for the dramatic with a barely there translucent dress and top that relied only on a few strategically placed stars to ensure propriety; but Patner and Bradley also provided several massive furs to cover up and ward off autumn chills.</p><p>Tuleh's colorful, dramatic designs were generally festive and lighthearted; die-hard New Yorkers who can't fathom life without black will go for the short asymmetric dress with a side-swept ruffle winding its way along the hem, and the romantic, off-the shoulder Bohemian tops.</p></div>"
99,fall,2001,f2001,ungaro-couture,"Serge Gainsbourg's roué soundtrack set the perfect mood for Emanuel Ungaro's Gallic collection.</p><p>A crimson satin blouse with matching knickers, foulard, ribbon-tie heels and tilted beret called for a Pigalle after-hours cabaret and plenty of cigarettes; so did his slinky flyaway dresses and asymmetric muslin tops. Ungaro also delivered plenty of salt-and-pepper tailleurs, window-pane coats and Prince of Wales pantsuits—all rakish and slim, often livened up thanks to ruffled shirts with a solitary graphic button below the shoulder. Cocktail minidresses with gigantic candy-wrap bows, emerald-green trousers and a blinding fuchsia pantsuit reminded us of Ungaro's playful side.</p><p>The designer ended his show on a more serene note, with flowing jersey, satin, crepe and taffeta dresses embroidered with delicate little trees and flowers plucked from a Japanese garden.</p></div>"
100,fall,2001,f2001,valentino,"""I'm inspired by clothes that are worn not because they are in fashion, but because they make women feel unique and confident,"" wrote Valentino in his program notes. The statement sums up his house's devotion to a loyal clientele of over 40 years, rather than to the often whimsical shifts of the fashion moment.</p><p>All of Valentino's well-known classics turned up on his runway: elegant tailleurs, glamorous gowns and plenty of sparkle. Day wear was forceful and strong: Black crepe suits with embroidered off-white georgette shirts, pinstripe trousers and fur-trimmed vests all had a masculine air to them. Red-and-beige tweed pantsuits, long plaid skirts and fishnet tops provided more casual alternatives.</p><p>Valentino's requisite evening gowns were mostly black crepe sheaths lavished with sequins; a strass-embroidered satin gown was embellished with panthers, and long taffeta dresses came generously ruffled. But no Valentino show would be complete without a shock of red: Alek Wek dazzled in a bias-cut backless number with a pinched waist and a sprinkle of ostrich feathers on the skirt.</p></div>"
101,fall,2001,f2001,veronique-branquinho,"In fashion, the most powerful statement is sometimes understatement. Veronique Branquinho is one of those rare talents who can transform seemingly ordinary looks into absolutely poetic ensembles.</p><p>Branquinho's subtle touch made contrasting turtleneck-and-tunic combinations seem positively dreamy; perfectly proportioned tuxedos dazzled with brightly colored lapels and linings. Even the all-black segment of the show—distressed jackets, patchwork velvet dresses and knit jumpers—was serene and uplifting rather than angst-ridden. But the designer really hit her stride when she breathed new life into the most conventional wardrobe staples. With an unerring sense of color, Branquinho paired a camel pea coat with a coppery-brown turtleneck and a perfect pair of navy pants; casual overcoats came with tunnel belts that created a slight gather in the back; the tiniest drizzle of glitter on a V-neck sweater or on the cuff of a simple top spoke volumes.</p><p>Rather than scampering for attention-grabbing gimmicks every season, Branquinho is quietly and consistently turning out impeccable and sensible clothes, positioning herself as one of the most self-assured designers of her generation.</p></div>"
102,fall,2001,f2001,versace,"Gray Milanese skies greeted the tired fashion flock with marked disdain, unleashing a snowstorm of biblical proportions upon their arrival. But by the time Donatella Versace’s show began, all talk of delayed flights, traffic jams and mud-splattered Manolos had given way to the usual game of celebrity spotting as Sting, Trudie Styler, singer Goldie and a diamond-and-fishnets-clad Signora Russell Simmons made their way to the front row.</p><p>Versace played up many of the themes she explored recently with her couture collection. Graphic prints, fitted hips and corseted waistlines were all at the core of her collection, though she managed to stray from the old-school diva allure; Trompe l’oeil–denim leather jeans and fitted blazers, wide-wale corduroy blousons, plush parkas in cashmere and sable, and several blue-tinted knockabout furs all looked sensational yet casual and easy to wear. The same could not be said for a couple of cocktail dresses with leather derriere huggers and an inexplicable inability to contain the bust; fortunately, Versace offered plenty of other after-5 options that included long, flared and belted satin gowns, flirty mini coats and show-stopping lacquered lace dresses that should be turning up on plenty of red carpets in the near future.</p></div>"
103,fall,2001,f2001,versus-versace,"Boy George spun blaring tracks, the runway shone bright with millions of light bulbs and Donatella Versace's junior girls trotted down the runway at full speed.</p><p>It was the typical Versus setup: high energy, plenty of attitude and all-out clothes that included skimpy zippered corduroy miniskirts, colorfully printed one-armed dresses and acid-pink rough-and-tumble furs. An explosion of yellow and orange skirts, triple-eyelet tops and paint-swirl coats preceded a series of off-the-shoulder, beaded and sheer black dresses that often revealed more than was necessary.</p><p>The spirit at Versus was fun and cool; still, at times one wished there would've been a clearer direction. While it's certain that Donatella Versace knows her way around a sexy outfit, parts of the collection lacked her usual bravado and sense of control.</p></div>"
104,fall,2001,f2001,victor-alfaro,"Milan seems to agree with Victor Alfaro. The Mexican-American designer's glamorous collection of on-the-go chic was one of his strongest in seasons.</p><p>Alfaro opened with a few equestrian looks that included long, tan leather coats, skin-tight jockey pants and flat riding boots, but quickly moved on to more urban ensembles like suede trousers with slouchy optic sweaters, one-strap dresses and three-button suits. But Alfaro really found his groove with the more casual yet absolutely luxurious looks; distressed jeans with a chunky red turtleneck and a sinfully long fur, for example, looked fantastic. So did a huge fur-lined military-olive parka that was both street-smart and lavishly decadent; treat it as an everyday coat, or throw it over one of Alfaro's delicately layered or ruffle-trimmed sexy black dresses. After all, mixing soft, feminine clothes with hard-edged basics is one of the season's key trends.</p></div>"
105,fall,2001,f2001,viktor-rolf,"""We were inspired by black holes, which absorb all light and energy,"" explained a dead-serious, soot-covered Rolf backstage. ""We wanted to transform negative feelings into something positive and creative.""</p><p>If only everyone's stress-management techniques were as fruitful. Working exclusively in black (just ask the painted models, who were struggling with cold cream and reams of tissues after the show), and touching upon the best of masters like Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, the Dutch duo delivered one of the strongest, bravest collections of the season.</p><p>In what amounted to an exhaustive exploration of volumes, Viktor and Rolf showed everything from enormous, flared-sleeve gowns and coats to fitted shirts with massive collars that accommodated gargantuan scarves and ties. Asymmetric dresses were gently ruched at the side and paired with cropped jackets that morphed into flowing, capelike wraps; skinny pinstripe trousers looked anything but ordinary with a matching padded vest that created a top-heavy silhouette. Pleated and ruffled shirts, leather-striped jeans, sharp denim blazers and shiny shirtdresses showed that Viktor and Rolf can provide everyday clothes without sacrificing an ounce of creativity.</p></div>"
106,fall,2001,f2001,vivienne-tam,"""East West Techno Fantasy"" was the ominous title of Vivienne Tam's collection, foreshadowing allusions to <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>. Tongue-in-cheek references, however, are not enough to see a collection through. Tam's paint-drip tees, motorcycle jackets and moleskin trousers worked because they looked natural and unpretentious, but the show ran into trouble the moment Tam toyed with plush tiger jackets, gigantic and unfeasible fur-trimmed ponchos and puzzling cracked-patch skirts. Ditto for the evening looks, which included everything from feathered and beaded tunics to lotus-print dolman dresses.</p><p>On the upside, Tam showed several moleskin pants, embroidered sweaters and jersey tops that would be a worthwhile addition to any basic wardrobe. Sometimes, less is definitely more.</p></div>"
107,fall,2001,f2001,wink,"Designer Wynn Smith certainly knows his way around the hallmarks of adolescence: His fun, witty presentation felt like a guided tour of a cooler-than-thou high school <em>Who's Who</em>.</p><p>Remember the snobby seniors who never gave you the time of day? They were all there, if considerably less menacing now in their flannel coat-dresses, double-breasted navy wool coats and perky Fair Isle blouses. Also on hand were the moody Ally Sheedy types, hidden under layers of black corduroy, textured prairie skirts in need of a wash and shrunken blazers stolen from someone else's boyfriend. More outgoing types identified with the girls who dared to wear blue plastic trapeze dresses, tie-dyed tees, miniature shorts and striped turtlenecks.</p><p>Smith succeeded in mixing and matching an assortment of references into an eclectic postmodern wardrobe that evoked plenty of all-too-familiar memories but still managed to look absolutely fresh and new.</p></div>"
108,fall,2001,f2001,yohji-yamamoto,"Sporty Yohji? <em>Jamais</em>!</p><p>Think again—the Japanese master of fluid, dramatic silhouettes and couturelike craftsmanship proved that he can deliver plenty of surprises with a casual, athletic-inspired collection.</p><p>Naturally, this was no ordinary track-and-field uniform. Baseball-bomber blousons were designed to trap one of the arms of its wearer in its folds. Casual trousers came equipped with a short skirt overlay. A hooded baseball-inspired jacket was shown with a voluminous, ballooned floral-print skirt. And no Yamamoto show would be complete without artful draping: His long, amorphous coats revealed unexpected panels when least expected; asymmetric dresses exposed one arm and covered the other with a generous, flowing sleeve.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""wqm6hs""></div></div><p>Yamamoto’s accessories included visor sunglasses and velvety bags that doubled as scarves—but it’s the colorful sneakers with red soles, silver racing stripes and floral designs that will have customers lining up next Fall.</p></div>"
1,spring,2002,s2002,alberta-ferretti,"There were no major surprises at Alberta Ferretti, where frilly femininity is always in fashion.</p><p>Ferretti opened with a pleated tomato skirt, white shirt and double-breasted fitted blazer—a simple, sophisticated combination that could have been developed further. Instead, however, Ferretti quickly moved on to her signature sheer dresses, generously ruffled and gathered, some with ravaged ribbon trimmings or beaded detailing; an optical print made a brief appearance, only to recede into a sea of blush lingerie gowns.</p><p>Ferretti is known for her lyrical sense of style, but in this case, stricter pieces like her gold topstitched coat and straight trousers left a more lasting impression than the wispy dresses, which all seemed to merge into one.</p></div>"
2,spring,2002,s2002,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Femininity with a hard edge is Alessandro Dell'Acqua's trademark. The embroidered translucent dresses that have seemed so fragile on other runways looked tough and defiant here, cinched with wide, tooled belts or woven leather cords. A wispy chiffon slip looked almost threatening when accessorized with a mannish vest, a driving cap and dizzyingly high punched-suede shoe-boots. And crisscrossed lace strips on airy tops brought to mind nothing so much as a sexy gunslinger.</p><p>This collection was full of pieces that reinforced Dell'Acqua's signature vision—one-shoulder gladiator dresses, fitted suede jeans and off-kilter ruffle skirts. What it lacked was any indication of what else the designer might be capable of doing.</p></div>"
3,spring,2002,s2002,alexander-mcqueen,"""The Dance of the Twisted Bull"" was the title of Alexander McQueen's highly anticipated collection, his first since partnering with Gucci Group and deciding to show in Paris.</p><p>McQueen pulled off a bravura, Latin-themed romp. One particularly theatrical dress came equipped with <em>banderillas</em>—the long spears with which bullfighters pique bulls—that seemed to impale the wearer in order to support a long ruffled train in the back. Another, a severely deconstructed blood-red señorita dress, had part of a jacket attached at the waist, while a matador-inspired strapless gown featured a built-in sword. An assortment of polka-dotted frocks were layered over matching stockings, and cinched with corsetlike straps and holster-inspired tops.</p><p>Alongside these dramatic statements came plenty of carefully tailored, eminently wearable clothes, deftly proving McQueen's ability to mix iconoclastic statements with commercially viable product. Razored jackets were softened via seashell-like pleated skirts with gently upturned fronts; flared-sleeve eyelet shirts, layered skirts, and embroidered white jeans all looked confident, as did the cut-out dresses and sharp-as-a-tack toreador suits.</p></div>"
4,spring,2002,s2002,alexandre-matthieu,"Spread the word: Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, known collectively as Alexandre Matthieu, have decided that the era of angst-ridden conceptual clothing is over.</p><p>The duo propose a poppy, lighthearted aesthetic driven by a sense of feminine fun. Inspired by the '30s silhouettes of Madeleine Vionnet, Morgado and Bureau showed loose cocktail dresses embellished with starburst smatterings of paillettes. A single-button pearl-white cocktail dress came with trailing split sleeves, while a lightweight top looked as if it had been expertly airbrushed with a row of crashing waves across the shoulders. In a more contemporary vein, the duo also included sexy red leather trousers, a white bomber jacket with floral appliqués and a satin blazer cinched with a single delicate thread.</p></div>"
5,spring,2002,s2002,alice-roi,"For her fourth season, Alice Roi presented a pilgrim/Amish-themed show that proved her most mature and consistent collection to date.</p><p>Trading her popular '80s-inspired bubblegum-girl silhouettes for long, fluid shapes, Roi opened with ankle-length dresses featuring grosgrain detailing at the wrists and waistline; the monastic effect was offset by thoroughly downtown, old-school Reebok boots. The designer stuck with neutral raw shades like pewter and oatmeal for her flowing country skirts and monkey-print frocks, but also ventured into city chic with fitted trousers, knockabout blazers and a couple of short scalloped lace dresses. Less interesting were the puff-sleeved Victorian shirts and flamenco-inspired tiered dresses, of which we saw plenty last season. Here, they felt gimmicky and derivative.</p><p>Despite these occasional misfires, Roi's collection confirmed that she is a name to watch closely in the future.</p></div>"
6,spring,2002,s2002,an-american-view,"[Editor’s note: Predating the CFDA/<em>Vogue</em> Fashion Fund was An American View. Organized in the aftermath of 9/11, which occurred during Fashion Week, An American View was a group fashion show featuring the work of designers who had not presented their spring 2002 collections before the attack. Here Meredith Melling, who was then a market editor for <em>Vogue,</em> remembers how it all came together.]</p><p>In the immediate wake of 9/11, a lot of <em>Vogue</em> editors were reporting to the office. We were doing whatever kind of rescue and relief efforts we could; we were donating clothes to people who were working at the Twin Towers. While we were all in the office together [Condé Nast’s offices were then located in Times Square] working on these things, we were also talking about the fragility of all of these young designers whose shows were canceled. Some designers had gotten the opportunity to show, but then the rest of the week was canceled.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>We all know about the delicacy of those businesses; to have no one see your collection and potentially no orders coming in, that could make or break your business. Anna Wintour decided we should put together a show in support of these designers. The conditions would be that it would be a group show. They were identified as designers who <em>Vogue</em> saw had potential or distinction in the market, were doing something really cool and unique, were on the commercial fast track—the same way we ultimately started looking at designers for the Fashion Fund. To qualify, your show also had to have been canceled.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""n8nwr""></div></div><p>Anna reached out to Carolina Herrera, who donated her showroom as a space where we would host the show. And then the booking editor at the time reached out to all the agencies, and we got whatever models were still in town to donate their time. So the space was free, the models walked for free.</p><p>The show was nine days after 9/11, so it all happened really quickly. We held the fittings in the <em>Vogue</em> offices so that the models had one place to report to, and then the designers all came in too. The sentiment that we were encouraging and that all the participating designers were on board with was that this was about giving you visibility, this was about camaraderie, this was the industry coming together. Josh Patner of Tuleh gave opening remarks, and it was agreed that there would be no music. So it was a silent show, which was really interesting. Each designer walked with one model from their segment at the end.</p></div>"
7,spring,2002,s2002,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester has the rare ability to invest her punky, hard-edged clothes with a lovely, lyrical quality.</p><p>Slouchy, low-slung trousers and oversize jackets have always been part of the Demeulemeester repertoire, and this season was no exception—done in black and white silk, they looked the epitome of nonchalant chic. Draped dresses, extra-short miniskirts, gathered-neck shirts and wrap shirt-jackets were street-smart rather than girly, cinched carelessly at the hips with multiple-loop belts. Unstructured military jackets, distressed leather coats, and severe ankle boots rounded out the collection.</p><p>Demeulemeester deftly tackled this season’s layering theme via a series of belts that came with attached half-skirts. Worn over a short dress or skirt, they create a silhouette that is asymmetric, anarchic—and unfailingly cool.</p></div>"
8,spring,2002,s2002,anna-molinari,"Anna Molinari designer Rossella Tarabini's main strength is culling trends from the street and reinterpreting them for the catwalk.</p><p>Tarabini showed an assortment of skimpy, sheer baby-doll slips and lingerie-like tops that referenced Fall's underwear-as-outerwear obsession. Her layered minidresses, loose cardigans and antique-looking paillette tops were layered over utility cargo shorts—a look that might be just a bit much for many of the label's younger customers. The same could be said for the flapper-inspired dresses with plumed hems that closed the show.</p><p>Still, there were plenty of fashion-savvy wearable pieces to be mixed and matched. A black pleated minidress with a white beaded collar, for example, was effortlessly chic. Tarabini's cotton blazers, meanwhile, are great everyday staples, as are her striped tees, velvet jackets and flat, short boots.</p></div>"
9,spring,2002,s2002,anna-sui,"Western pioneers and prairie dwellers were the main source of inspiration this season for Anna Sui, a designer who has built her reputation on her ability to re-imagine the fashions of days gone by.</p><p>In her Art Nouveau-inspired showroom, equipped with wrought-iron mirrors, velour settees with heart-shaped backs and colored glass lamps, Sui showed antique denim dresses with embroidered hems, sheer Swiss-miss tops, and girly, dotted dresses worn with virginal white tights and ballerina flats. Spicing things up, the designer moved on to less innocent Daisy Duke-style short shorts, tight airbrushed jeans, and skimpy butterfly crepe shirts. Indigo and lace mini-frocks, floral tops and distressed cotton crochet dresses completed the collection.</p><p>Rounding off Sui's sexy update on Western saloon style were cameo brooches, turn-of-the-(nineteenth)-century necklaces and tan cowgirl boots.</p></div>"
10,spring,2002,s2002,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi reclaimed his Italian roots with a carefully staged backdrop that included a little Vespa motor scooter, an ice-cream stand and festively strewn lights.</p><p>Traditionally crafted leather and heavily worked lace—two of Berardi's favorite materials—were key to his collection. His see-through skintight trousers, razored jackets and ultraslim pants were sexy as ever (especially with the just-stumbled-out-of-bed Rapunzel hairdos on Berardi's models); textured denim jackets and jeans offered a slightly more sedate option. Die-hard fans will go for Berardi's lingerie-like party slips, which can go from the dance floor to the bedroom in the blink of an eye.</p><p>How to close such a high-powered presentation? Consider a stunning flapper-inspired silver paillette dress with a floral motif—a brave alternative to the understated simplicity that is so often championed on more conventional runways.</p></div>"
11,spring,2002,s2002,arkadius,"Think of Arkadius as the Alexander McQueen of Poland. Fully embracing the more theatrical side of London's Central Saint Martins college, the Slavic designer has, in past shows, “given birth” on the runway and brandished a rubber cast of his own severed head at the audience for a finale.</p><p>Arkadius' Spring collection, relatively low on dramatics compared to past performances, was based on a Catholic theme, the adoration of the Virgin. Beginning with a shaven-headed, bare-breasted “Mary” festooned with crucifixes and a crown of thorns, the show converted embroidery usually seen on priestly vestments into pants and dresses, while interspersing padded 3-D appliqués of the Madonna and Child and the Sacred Heart onto tops. In between, there were calmer moments where Arkadius worked with lace, georgette ruffles and paisley for party dresses with complicated cuts. Then the show reverted to a religious climax as a model paraded, in gold brocade pants, with her face inserted into an icon.</p><p>One poignant sight was the singular back view of a red jacket, with a dove of peace embroidered on the back.</p></div>"
12,spring,2002,s2002,badgley-mischka,"After spending a couple of seasons exploring the alien terrain of sensible daywear, Mark Badgley and James Mischka have gone back to their first love: the high-octane evening gowns that have made them nearly as famous as the Hollywood celebutantes they love to dress.</p><p>This season, the duo's attention-loving gowns have a decidedly antique feeling. An embroidered paisley column was lavished with candle-like drippings of translucent beads; dreamy shades of marigold, apricot, iris and tuberose gave a youthful spin to a slinky assortment of long sheaths that were generously decorated with cutouts and floral appliqués. The non-full-length department was represented by '20s-inspired Deco slips and shirtdresses.</p><p>For those few Badgley Mischka customers who venture outdoors before 6 p.m., there were several light tweed dresses and suits, including a jacket embellished with—no surprise here—a smattering of beads down the sides.</p></div>"
13,spring,2002,s2002,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière once again defined the mood of the moment, capturing the romantic, ethnic currents of this season with an exquisitely crafted Balenciaga collection.</p><p>Ghesquière started with his most elaborate pieces, showing beautiful patchwork vests, microdresses and jackets made from a collage of shimmering vintage Indian fabrics. Paired with loose, no-nonsense cargo trousers, they projected casual sophistication of the drop-dead cool variety. Ghesquière’s skimpy, ravaged pink salopettes served as a sweet prelude to his high-impact black-and-silver trousers and skirts; the final all-black, extra-loose vests and tuxedos played out like a clever deconstruction of fall’s Victorian corsets and bodices.</p><p>Ghesquière’s floating silhouettes are sure to be hugely influential next spring.</p></div>"
14,spring,2002,s2002,bally,"Inspired by the makeover success stories of labels such as Louis Vuitton and Burberry, Harvard-trained business-graduate-turned-designer Scott Fellows is determined to make Bally the next world-class luxury brand.</p><p>In these label-obsessed times, a globally recognized name is a prized asset for any fashion house. And for the last few seasons, Bally has made considerable efforts to update its prestigious history, opening revamped flagships and launching a full clothing line. After making a splash with last season's chic woven leathers, Fellows went for graphic, simple basics this time around. A white tailored pantsuit was accented with a diamond-pattern cummerbund waistband; square-ribbon skirts and shifts looked perfectly prim.</p><p>Bally's strategy is to create wearable, luxurious pieces that don't slavishly follow trends. While many of Fellows' designs fit that bill, others, like the geometric-inset leather dresses and trousers, fell short of expectations. If the label is to succeed in the competitive luxury-goods arena, the Bally team will have to flex a little more creative muscle.</p></div>"
15,spring,2002,s2002,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria went for tough romanticism this season, presenting a nearly all-white collection of sheer overlays worn with plenty of defiant attitude.</p><p>Azria's program notes promised visions of Saint Tropez and shades of the Riviera. In reality, the look was reminiscent of Zandra Rhodes' decidedly urban slashed handkerchief-point dresses. Fluid jerseys, supple suedes, dip-dye leathers and lightweight cottons were all layered, draped and wrapped asymmetrically. Leather cutout bustiers, short fitted skirts and skimpy crochet tops were all fun and youthful, though not particularly original. A short denim suit and an eggshell coat stood out as practical, everyday staples.</p><p>For his accessories, Azria reworked some of the most important fall favorites, including long macramé belts with streamers and western-inspired leather boots.</p></div>"
16,spring,2002,s2002,bernhard-willhelm,"Bernhard Willhelm has arrived as one of the most important designers of his generation, thanks in part to the sheer breadth of his creative range. In the past, he has given us everything from happy-go-lucky 80s pop chicks to naive housewives and, yes, even African dung-beetle chic.</p><p>Hundreds of tendril-like filament lights and a soundtrack by Depeche Mode set the mood for Willhelm's New Wave-influenced take on futurism circa 1983. The designer mashed together a range of pop culture references with theatrical masks and allusions to the movie ""Dune"" turning up on witty sweatshirt dresses. His postmodern tribe members can get away with wearing everything from Liquid Sky makeup to sweatsuits with slit peekaboo seams, wrap paillette skirts with computer-print faces, flowing desert smocks, clouds of tulle, and cartoon-like guardsmen coats.</p><p>Willhelm's accessories also stand out miles from the crowd. Witness a pair of perfectly flat fringed booties; a carry-all shaped like an animatronics bear (to be cradled like a baby); and a space-shuttle canvas tote.</p></div>"
17,spring,2002,s2002,betsey-johnson,"The gilded, mirrored, wallpapered and chandelier-laden salon of Manhattan’s Tavern on the Green formed the over-the-top setting for ""Muñequita,"" as Betsey Johnson dubbed her Latin-themed extravaganza.</p><p>Here is Johnson’s vision for Spring, from the bottom up. Start with cork-spike heels of vertigo-inducing heights, complete with iridescent straps; set them off with ankle-length fishnets and an ankle bracelet with a dangling cross. If you must insist on underwear, go for a demi-bra bikini set in neon colors and make sure it peeks out at all times. Next, throw on a multitiered fiesta minidress, a metallic lace-and-ribbon teddy or a cha-cha top with turquoise hot pants. Now top it all off with a jangle of gold bangles; enormous hoop earrings; an oversize ""BJ"" ring (that stands for Betsey Johnson, lest there be any confusion); shimmering makeup; hot-pink mesh gloves with the tips cut off; a tattoo or three; and a net bandanna worn over a floppy Panama hat.</p><p>Not quite enough for you? Then you might as well throw in a traditional mantilla, too—after receiving the Johnson treatment, they manage to look positively decadent.</p></div>"
18,spring,2002,s2002,bill-blass,"Lars Nilsson, now in his second season at Bill Blass, hit a home run with a collection that is sure to put the venerable fashion house firmly back on the map.</p><p>How does a Swedish-born, Paris-trained designer interpret classic American style? By staying true to Blass' legacy of simple sophistication. With witty references to masculine tailoring, Nilsson went for high-waisted trousers, immaculately cut striped blazers, and pale glen-plaid suits. The designer also demonstrated his acuity with color, via floral coats and skirts, a cravat-printed shirtdress, breezy jackets, and dresses stamped with a bold ""vegetable tree"" motif.</p><p>The evening statements, however, were the real newsmakers. Using humble, homespun fabrics like cotton piqué and linen, Nilsson whipped up extraordinary gowns and sweeping ball skirts. Erin O'Connor's final ensemble neatly encapsulated the theme of understated chic: An unassuming pale-blue linen jacket, worn with a painstakingly embroidered sunflower skirt to the floor, looked like a million bucks.</p></div>"
19,spring,2002,s2002,blaak,"Though many designers who are equipped to show elsewhere have quit the London scene this season, others are stepping into the limelight to defend the city's creative reputation. One such is Blaak, the collection by Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, who showed on the official British Fashion Council runway for the first time.</p><p>The theme was African Zulu, starting with strong pieces in ebony leather, decorated with tribal scarification patterns and festooned with belts and jewelry in wood, leather and cowrie shells by Edward Griffiths. Black jersey T-shirts with cutouts and knotted details looked great with soft skirts, but the confidence of Blaak's touch really emerged as the pair added asymmetric skirts with black and white prints, and a crumpled cotton collarless shirt.</p><p>""It was our interpretation of African,"" said Okada, ""but instead of direct, indirect. It should be something you could wear in London or New York. We wanted it to be super-tribal, super-happy, so you feel the heat."" That's an act of solidarity, not insensitivity, she added.

20,spring,2002,s2002,hugo-boss,"Now in its third season of producing women's clothing, Boss Hugo Boss is making a strong play to join the ranks of prominent international designer brands. Despite being based in a quiet suburb of Stuttgart, Germany, Boss taps into the most current trends and translates them into sleek, highly wearable collections.</p><p>Since Boss made its name in menswear, it's no surprise that its women's line is based around a core of tailored suits and trim shirts. By playing with sheer fabrics, plunging necklines and layers of featherweight fabrics, these traditionally masculine pieces deliver a real jolt of femininity. Glazed chiffon is cut into black evening column dresses with scoop necks. An airy cotton shift-dress goes beyond basic with a subtle row of intricate cross-seams down the front. And a silky navy suit turns out to be pinstriped, as shimmery silver lines catch the light.</p><p>For a reasonably priced collection (think somewhere between Miu Miu and Prada), Boss Hugo Boss uses rich fabrics and cuts them with exacting precision.</p></div>"
21,spring,2002,s2002,boudicca,"Boudicca partners Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby were both peaceful observers of the tempestuous events surrounding the G-7/8 Summit in Genoa this year, and their ""Corporate Deserters"" presentation was designed to convey some of the tension and anguish they felt there.</p><p>Boudicca's masked models stepped out to a menacing soundtrack that featured the whir of surveillance helicopters. In homage to the early British warrior queen for whom the label is named, many of the clothes were dyed woad blue—the color of the war paint that she used. The severe tailoring and complex dressmaking, meanwhile, conjured a couture vision of the '50s, as filtered through an early '80s electro-pop sensibility. Boxy shouldered jackets and trousers with squared-off box-pleat hems were juxtaposed with pencil-skirted '50s air-hostess dresses or elaborate evening gowns. The gowns, in taffeta and old-fashioned brocades (and featuring the most hard-edged use of eyelet embroidery so far this season) had the look of midcentury haute couture pieces, their elaborate construction paradoxically set off with raggedly unfinished seams.</p><p>Memories of Genoa were reflected in cryptic details—like brass name tags, or the legend ""FAULT,"" with an arrow pointing toward an arm seam—that cannot have the same resonance for those who weren't there.</p></div>"
22,spring,2002,s2002,bruce,"Nicole Noselli and Daphne Gutierrez, who make up the design team Bruce, snapped up this year's Perry Ellis Award for womenswear, and with good reason. The duo consistently produces quietly intelligent, sophisticated clothes whose apparent simplicity betrays an almost compulsive attention to detail.</p><p>Noselli and Gutierrez worked with a muted chromatic range (white, black, khaki and brick were the only colors in the collection), relying on clean, perfectly proportioned lines for effect. A pristine tab-collar cotton shirtdress was stark and immaculate, except for a copper cincture at the waist and minute pin-tucks that decorated the sleeves; dresses gently skimmed the body, shaped only by deftly applied tucks and folds. A triple layer of pleats ran across the shoulders of a prim cap-sleeve shirt; an off-kilter skirt looked perfect with an intricately constructed, asymmetric sleeveless top.</p><p>""We wanted to work with pleating, like last season, but presenting a looser, more comfortable silhouette,"" said Noselli after the show.</p></div>"
23,spring,2002,s2002,burberry-prorsum,"Just as Burberry's latest ad campaign was startlingly plaid—and logo-free—the once staid English company's Spring show broadened the scope of its style while remaining true to its London roots.</p><p>Former Gucci lieutenant Christopher Bailey has distilled the Burberry look into several core elements that offer a grown-up take on London street style. Pants come low-slung, straight and full through the calf, ending in a devil-may-care puddle well below the ankle. Skirts are cut either short around the thigh with punky grommet belts or in haphazard-looking loose drapes. Colors mainly stick to mellow hues of khaki, aubergine, black and navy, with a few zaps of jade and violet.</p><p>While crinkled blouses and loudly striped tank tops might seem a little too street for a lady who lunches (and can afford designer clothes), Bailey wisely tops off his grungier pieces with chic khaki trenchcoats and tailored pinstripe jackets. This kind of balancing act is just what the label needs to woo fickle big spenders, not just in London but in L.A. and beyond.</p></div>"
24,spring,2002,s2002,cacharel,"The Cacharel stage was decorated by illustrator Julie Verhoeven with drawings of pixie-like creatures, complemented by swirling laser projections—the perfect setting for the kaleidoscopic designs presented by Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro.</p><p>""Spanish Harlem Sunday Best meets Teenage Mall-Rat"" was how the duo described their cocktail of orchid prints, table-cloth ginghams, brushstroke floras, cartoon animals and colorful toiles de Jouy. Cacharel's renaissance has been driven by this poppy, lighthearted esthetic, and this season should satisfy young customers with plenty of cool basics like candy-colored chevron jackets, sexy jersey dresses, flower-power suits and high-impact bags and mules.</p><p>At times, however, Clements and Ribeiro's enthusiasm got the best of them. The extended parade of sugary, pretty-girl dresses and a final series of Victorian lace numbers left some hankering for a sobering shot of insulin.</p></div>"
25,spring,2002,s2002,calvin-klein-collection,"""It's not all I planned to show, but this selection encapsulates the general feeling of the collection,"" said Calvin Klein. Demonstrating New Yorkers' eagerness to get back to business as usual, Klein staged a small showroom presentation just a few days after fashion week had to be canceled.</p><p>""There's lots of boyish shapes and silhouettes,"" said Klein as the first model took to the makeshift runway. ""Jackets and coats are cut with large shoulders. Everything is big, but not too big."" Klein officially launched a new Spring favorite: the mannish, oversize white shirt, which can be thrown over snappy shorts, tucked into full, pleated trousers or worn with a hefty belt as a short, sexy dress. Pinstripe trousers matched with a half-sleeve button-down offered a playful take on traditional power dressing, while a group of aubergine and navy dresses with Deco-inspired paneling and stitching offered a more feminine counterpoint to the masculine tailoring. (""They remind me of the Chrysler building,"" said Klein.)</p><p>What about accessories? Those who are already fearing boot overload by the time March rolls around will be more than ready for Klein's no-nonsense gladiator sandals and flat patent slides. On the hunt for the perfect evening bag? A tiny, silver-beaded clutch could be just the thing—provided, of course, you never carry more than keys and lipstick.</p></div>"
26,spring,2002,s2002,carolina-herrera,"Carolina Herrera is in a lighthearted mood, focusing on soft silhouettes embellished with romantic details.</p><p>The white shirt was the central theme of her collection; it came laced up, tucked into generous skirts, delicately embroidered and worn as a camisole over pajama pants. For contrast, there were coffee-and-emerald check pants and skirts, stone poplin suits and a great silk crepe dress with a pleated flapper fringe and nude back. Herrera also showed a few leather shirts and wrap skirts, but these felt a bit cumbersome and stiff at times.</p><p>Evening was a smorgasbord of pleats. Old-school gowns and grand sweeping skirts in pearl-gray organza stole all the thunder from the charmeuse tank gowns, which offered a familiar spin on the current lingerie-dressing craze.</p></div>"
27,spring,2002,s2002,celine,"Michael Kors' sunny, low-key Celine collection was full of what he does best: pretty, practical summer staples that make an easy transition from the beach to a poolside soiree.</p><p>Though Kors' program notes talked about his Mediterranean inspiration, it was the graphic designs of '60s Scandinavian cult label Marimekko that was brought to mind by the designer's large avocado-and-paprika sunflower-print jackets, coats and skirts. Kors interspersed his flower-power looks with breezy crochet shells, crepe jersey tank dresses and multistripe canvas shorts and shirts; rounding things out were flat sandals and a roomy tote. For cocktail hour there were snappy turquoise-, amethyst- and silver-beaded dresses that looked just as relaxed as the daywear.</p></div>"
28,spring,2002,s2002,cerruti,"""The collection is about tenderness, using soft fabrics with wallpaper prints and mattress stripes, all worked into fluid shapes,"" said Peter Speliopoulos during his small showroom presentation.</p><p>Speliopoulos' collection was one of his best ever for Cerruti. Filmy peasant tops, tiered miniskirts and camisole dresses with romantic overlays projected laid-back comfort. Smart linen blazers, casual suede jeans and a great disc-studded cotton jacket fringed with shoelaces all looked as though they had enjoyed a fabulous previous life. Carefully thought-out details, like rope cinches on flared-sleeve blouses and weighty ruffled collars on boho dresses, made some of the softer pieces extra-special.</p><p>To complete this easygoing wardrobe, Speliopoulos debuted a Cerruti accessories line, featuring flat, simple sandals, large totes and a great washed-lizard clutch.</p></div>"
29,spring,2002,s2002,chalayan,"Fresh from his six-month sabbatical, Hussein Chalayan is back in business, and better than ever. After the comparatively lackluster presentations of Milan, Chalayan opened Paris fashion week with a much-needed burst of creative energy.</p><p>""The collection was based on cursing, voodoo and superstition,"" said the designer after the show, adding that he had been inspired by a book called The Dictionary of Superstition. Balancing high-concept experimentation with urban practicality, Chalayan's deconstructed panels, zippered layers and off-kilter silhouettes came together beautifully. Short, pleated skirts with streamers and asymmetric sleeveless tops looked effortless, despite their elaborate seaming and detailing. A green, tooled leather jacket with gathered shoulders and dangling cords was an exercise in sculptural precision; frayed-edge jackets, practical minis and lace-up trousers had plenty of real-world appeal.</p><p>Chalayan devotees remember that his college graduation project consisted of iron-filled paper clothes that had been buried in his garden and allowed to rust. In a reprise of that strategy, some parts of Chalayan's stunning final dresses had once again been buried and aged, giving them a timeless, almost mythic aura.</p></div>"
30,spring,2002,s2002,chanel,"The newly rakish, ultrasvelte Karl Lagerfeld was in a youthful mood, opening his Chanel show with sporty motorcycle ensembles, two-tone sneakers, collegiate messenger bags and colorful backpacks.</p><p>More traditional Chanel staples followed, in the house’s beloved black and white. Snappy little coats and sexy tunnel jackets lined in satin could be worn with fitted trousers, or on their own as skimpy minidresses. These were a prelude to more fluid, romantic silhouettes: For 2002, Chanel skirts are long and sheer, belted at the hip, knife-pleated and paired with simple cashmere tees. Muslin dresses also fall to the ankles, and can be layered under ruffled tops.</p><p>Lagerfeld accented many of his more high-powered looks with rows of Coco pearls; these also turned up as sexy straps on his kitten-heel boots and shoes.</p></div>"
31,spring,2002,s2002,chloe,"Phoebe Philo proved herself quite capable of taking over the creative reigns of a major house like Chloé.</p><p>Avoiding in-your-face rock ’n’ roll attitude, Philo blurred the distinction between day and evening wear with breezy separates inspired by ’70s Saint Tropez, Brigitte Bardot, and Talitha Getty. A sense of easygoing elegance permeated everything from fitted tops with intricately worked sleeves to lace-trimmed camisoles and fabulous monkey-appliqué bathing suits. A long suede skirt with blush gray and black panels exuded earthy chic, as did the Moroccan-style beaded bags and sandal-boots in aged gold leather.</p><p>Die-hard Chloé fans will be glad to know that there are still plenty of high-impact sexy staples to be had. The low-slung flared pants with flirty cutouts at the hips, pinafore shorts, summery minidresses and punchy T-shirts with net backs are likely to keep cash registers working overtime.</p></div>"
32,spring,2002,s2002,christian-dior,"John Galliano’s “Street Chic” collection took the form of a virtual world tour, with stops that included lavishly clad Bedouins, army recruits and girls in the ’hood.</p><p>This was not the first time Dior has gone globetrotting, but Galliano injected, as always, new energy into his ethnic excursions. His bias-cut silk and lace dresses, embroidered jackets and sheer tops will work better than ever in this season of unbridled romanticism. Python jackets and low-slung hip-hop jeans also seem right for the moment, while the more eye-popping pieces—like the glittering pantsuit embroidered with kitschy Americana motifs—are just the thing for a starlet’s weekend jaunt to Vegas.</p><p>Galliano also showed a series of great-looking patchwork and Mexican serape-print bathing suits, embellished with utilitarian canvas straps.</p></div>"
33,spring,2002,s2002,christian-lacroix,"For Spring 2002, Christian Lacroix incorporated Art Nouveau references into his opulent, romantic style.</p><p>Silk blouses were piped in leather and embroidered with graphic tulle swirls; mottled, metallic-tinted leather jackets came with corset closures and cutouts. Lacroix's dresses—always elaborate experiments in color and patching—were asymmetrically cut and often distressed, sometimes extremely so. There were several beautiful, billowy embroidered blouses, one paired with pegged tomato crepe jogging trousers. A simple trenchcoat became paparazzi-worthy when executed in embroidered red organza.</p><p>Eveningwear is Lacroix's forte, and this season his standouts are taffeta blouses with frilled and pleated necklines, jackets with knotted sleeves, and printed chiffon tunics, all embellished with a peacock motif.</p></div>"
34,spring,2002,s2002,clements-ribeiro,"Referencing ""The St. Tropez of Veruschka and Jane Birkin, San Francisco's Summer of Love and the London of Bianca and Mick Jagger,"" Clements Ribeiro traveled back to the days of haute bohemia with diagonal-panel peace-and-love skirts, off-the-shoulder prairie tops and ruffle-cascade chiffon dresses. Though these hippie classics have become overly familiar of late, several of Clements Ribeiro's pieces had verve to spare. There was a great fringed poncho dress, several naively embroidered skirts and jeans, and a series of star-studded, sporty cashmere sweaters.</p><p>Rounding out the equation were lavishly fringed sandals and totes—the first installments in Clements Ribeiro's just-launched accessories line.</p></div>"
35,spring,2002,s2002,comme-des-garcons,"What inspires Rei Kawakubo is one of fashion’s million-dollar questions. The elusive designer once told <em>Vogue</em> that her collections are built around “whatever I am feeling at that moment”; for Spring 2002 that must have been childlike. There was an airy sense of innocence to this show, which at moments leaned toward kawaii. Kawakubo made use of an adorable novelty print featuring pugs. Pugs! There was also a fabric emblazoned with large graphic numbers, like those that might appear in a youngster’s schoolbook. Moreover, plastered to the models’ heads were papier-mâché caps made of newsprint that gave them the look of old-time porcelain Pierrot dolls.</p><p><em>Naive</em> is a word critics often and perhaps too readily apply to Kawakubo’s work, which is as forthright in its deconstruction as it is complicated in conception. This show, with its bows and ruffs, seemed more straightforward than many, save for its title, Ethnic Couture. What does it mean? Could Kawakubo have been referencing Dutch Old Masters or just having fun? Whatever the answer, she made it look as easy as one-two-three.</p></div>"
36,spring,2002,s2002,costume-national,"Ennio Capasa's Costume National collection, executed almost entirely in black and white, was thankfully short.</p><p>At heart, Capasa is a minimalist who emphasizes form above everything else—he is at his best designing sharp jackets and no-nonsense trousers. Why then, would he choose to cinch most of his looks with unflattering bodybuilder belts-turned-corsets? The effect was jarring and distracting.</p><p>Worn without those unfortunate accessories, many of Capasa's clothes will work just fine as sensible everyday uniforms—the roomy overcoats, eyelet-trimmed skirts and peasant shirts are all in touch with current trends. Nonetheless, it was disappointing to see Capasa strike only one note through the entire show.</p></div>"
37,spring,2002,s2002,cynthia-rowley,"Cynthia Rowley has always been a good answer for young women in search of affordable party frocks without too much of an edge. With their distinctly American roots, Rowley's designs are reassuringly familiar, but with enough of a twist to keep them fresh.</p><p>This season Rowley jumped on the ethereal peasant bandwagon, spinning metallic lace and sweet embroidered cotton into looks fit for a Woodstock reveler. While some of the midriff-baring blouses and tight patent belts looked awkward, the bulk of this collection is ideal for Springtime patio cocktail parties from Silverlake to Sag Harbor.</p><p>The knockout number? A metallic purple lace cocktail dress with a U-shaped neckline, which is bold and rich looking without being flashy.</p></div>"
38,spring,2002,s2002,d-g,"For their Spring 2002 D&amp;G collection, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce exchanged the world of techno dance clubs—one of their recurring points of reference—for that of ballet companies, replete with satin toe shoes and a barre.</p><p>Like so many <em>A Chorus Line</em> hopefuls, models swished into the curvy show space clad in bunched and tightly layered tops, skirts, jackets and leggings, often wound up with thick satin ribbons and chiffon streamers. Giddy tutus morphed into full tiered skirts, worn with cheeky slogan T-shirts and snuggly wrapped cardigan sweaters. Washed-out tones of gray, nude and khaki played off neon-green blasts.</p><p>As with most D&amp;G shows, the piled-on look is meant to ignite flash fires of lust among teenage fashion fanatics. The good news is that, taken piece by piece, the collection is full of surprisingly wearable clothes.</p></div>"
39,spring,2002,s2002,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg is moving beyond the wrap dress. Sure, there are still plenty of those all-time favorites to choose from (this season there's even a lace one), but the designer is clearly eager to liven things up by throwing new elements into the mix.</p><p>With her West Village townhouse packed to capacity, and with the likes of Susan Sarandon, Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer and Tracey Ullman in the front row, von Furstenberg unleashed a parade of ""rebel princesses."" Plasticized miniskirts, cha-cha skirts, and chiffon boudoir chemises worn over cigarette pinstripe pants are now staples of the von Furstenberg wardrobe. A ""boss woman"" striped dress was worn with a black ruffle bikini; for evening, a formal tuxedo consisted of a cropped, navel-baring jacket and pajamalike pull-up trousers.</p><p>Of course, there were also more traditional selections to choose from. A ""floating O's"" print showed up on lightweight dancer skirts and dresses; practical safari jackets, shrunken blazers and suede trousers will work perfectly as a no-nonsense, everyday uniform.</p></div>"
40,spring,2002,s2002,dolce-gabbana,"Who better to embody Dolce &amp; Gabbana's vision of high-intensity glamour than Victoria Beckham, formerly known as Posh Spice? In her fitted top-stitched suit, oversize aviators, driving cap, spike heels and net gloves (over which was slipped a candy-sized diamond ring), Mrs. Beckham made the perfect front-row celebutante for this full-on show.</p><p>Posh surely found plenty to catch her silver-accented eye: Dolce &amp; Gabbana offered everything from perfectly tailored jackets and elephant-leg trousers to corseted frocks and ultra-feminine lace-inset dresses (worn with skimpy cardigan wraps thrown over the shoulders and tied in the front). The upbeat collection escalated into an explosion of color that included eye-popping flower-print chiffon dresses, woven ribbon jackets and miniskirts, and suede jeans with purple, gold, lavender and red leather insets. The absolute standout was a short parakeet-print dress in jungle shades, worn with a multihued woven belt and a pink-and-green carrier purse.</p><p>Accessories, anyone? Major statements included a metallic logo belt, gold D and G pendants, and a dangling set of earrings that spelled out—what else?—""Dolce"" and ""Gabbana.""</p></div>"
41,spring,2002,s2002,donna-karan,"It has not been an easy year for Donna Karan, who lost her husband to cancer just a few months ago. ""My private grief has now become part of a collective one,"" said the designer, adding that her ""collection was inspired by my husband, his art and everything he loved.""</p><p>The collection is certainly a strong one. Working with featherweight parachute silks, Karan created shimmering belted crinoline coats, cross-pleat skirts and some of the best ponchos we've seen in years (why not wear a platinum stretch silk, double-breasted, double-front poncho trench as an evening gown?). Experimenting with asymmetric seaming to create surprising volume, the designer produced intriguing structures that floated over the body, often stretched over armatures or held together with boning. The architectural motif extended to the long, hand-painted silk organza dresses, some of which were accessorized with Robert Lee Morris' sculptural wire jewelry.</p></div>"
42,spring,2002,s2002,dries-van-noten,"The folk revival has been all too common this season, but Dries Van Noten breathed new life into the overworked concept with his fluid, gentle lines and unerring sense of color.</p><p>Tie-dyed robes evoked the serenity of the Himalayas rather than the grunge of Berkeley in the 60s; floor-length camisoles, wrap blanket coats and minutely embroidered peasant shirts hit just the right note. More urban staples like blazers and trousers were unstructured and amply cut; an oversized, olive green parka looked soft and delicate when belted and bloused.</p><p>Even die-hard minimalists will be tempted to incorporate one of Van Noten’s extra-wide beaded scarves, a low-slung organic bag or a pair of colorful heels into their functional wardrobes.</p></div>"
43,spring,2002,s2002,emilio-pucci,"Designer Julio Espada is now in his second season at Pucci, attempting to revive the fashion house's glory days and make it relevant for a new generation.</p><p>Capitalizing on Pucci's bold, instantly recognizable prints, Espada showed plenty of pretty, girly shorts, scarf sundresses and crisp cotton jackets. Chic, quirky details included cork buttons on poolside robes and mother-of-pearl embroidery on little halters, frothy evening gowns and knotted handbags. The outsized prima-donna sunglasses were also a hit.</p><p>The Pucci name, however, has always stood for practicality as much as high-impact glamour. And Espada's collection, though sweet and well-executed, lacked much of the easygoing simplicity of the label's classic jersey turtlenecks and zip-up jackets. Nostalgia alone will not propel this brand into the future.</p></div>"
44,spring,2002,s2002,emporio-armani,"Emporio Armani sent a fleet of innocent smiling girls down the runway en route to a tropical paradise.</p><p>This nautically themed collection began with wavy frills and ruffles peeping out from snappy sailor jackets. Simple petticoats were embellished with vivacious kerchief hems; skirts, dresses and trousers were all trimmed with generous cascades of fringe. (The skimpy black dress Alek Wek wore was the best of the lot.) Sporty, colorful island dresses packed plenty of Hawaiian punch, as did the petal-ruffle minis.</p><p>The holiday mood blossomed into striped and floral shirts, embroidered and layered over tops and dresses. Jet beads and pearl embroideries finished off dramatic tulle evening gowns that were accessorized with half-circle earrings and black-flower leis, and fringed with the ubiquitous belt skirts.</p></div>"
45,spring,2002,s2002,fendi,"In sharp contrast to the girly aesthetic that has prevailed during these collections, Karl Lagerfeld presented the Fendi woman as strong, confident and even, at times, aggressive.</p><p>Banishing delicate pastel tones, Lagerfeld clad his nomadic warriors in every shade of brick, mauve and brown, better to complement their choppy braided hairdos and tribal tattoo eye makeup. Layers were key. Sheer smocks and subtly printed shirts wafted over fitted trousers cinched above the knee with tie-straps; trailblazer skirts, worked-leather frontier vests, ruffled frocks and minutely embellished sheer tunics were all piled atop each other with abandon.</p><p>These dramatic ensembles may not be the most practical everyday staples, but Fendi's accessories are sure to be among the season's best sellers. Lagerfeld's then-and-now studded oyster bags, tooled leather boots and distressed woven sashes all looked like they could have been transported by mule from the outback to the Via Sciesa showroom.</p></div>"
46,spring,2002,s2002,gianfranco-ferre,"Poised high on an oversize velvet pillow and surrounded by lavishly embroidered blankets, a shawl-clad figure played the sitar as guests took their seats for Gianfranco Ferré's romp through Indian style.</p><p>Ferré worked plenty of his signature architectural flights of fancy into the show. Carefully constructed white coats and caftan jackets morphed into pegged trousers accented with hand-beaded silver strips. Elaborate organza creations featured drawstring furrowings, spiral encirclings, and textured appliqués. Metallic stitching turned up on leather skirts; silk patchwork pants were worn with embroidered twinsets; and long skirts and gowns were trimmed with dangling gold coins. Ferré's finale took the form of a glow-in-the-dark series of embroidered tangerine, lemon and orange dresses.</p><p>Fans of Ferré's extravagant aesthetic were not disappointed.</p></div>"
47,spring,2002,s2002,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani had plenty to celebrate today. His presentation served as the official inauguration of the impressive Armani theater, nestled within his brand-new, 12,000-square-meter commercial headquarters designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando.</p><p>Armani presented a light, fluid collection executed mostly in black and white. Jackets were slightly squared, short and structured, paired with asymmetric-hem trousers. Off-the-shoulder, striped handkerchief tops suggested a Deauville getaway, while a series of tank dresses blended athletic chic with ballet-inspired romanticism. Transparency was the mantra for evening, with brilliantly embroidered flowers inching their way up wide-leg trousers and barely there gowns.</p><p>In an adjacent room, Armani also hosted a photographic exhibition, <em>The Making of the Pirelli Calendar 2002</em>. The behind-the-scenes photographs were taken by Peter Lindbergh while shooting the iconic calendar, which this year features Hollywood's brightest young stars wearing … Giorgio Armani.</p></div>"
48,spring,2002,s2002,givenchy,"After his awkward debut during couture week, Welsh designer Julien Macdonald is still struggling to find his feet.</p><p>The house of Givenchy has always been known for its purity of line and simplicity of design—the polar opposite of Macdonald's heavy-handed use of ruching, cord inlays and cabled trims. While some pieces were finely made—notably a striking off-white poplin dancer skirt with layered crinolines and a pink marbleized dip-dye shirt—they got lost in an overabundance of decoration. Macdonald's high-waist pegged trousers, too sheer smocked dresses and fussy riding jackets all felt contrived.</p><p>Ultimately, this collection fell short of forging the new identity that Givenchy seeks.</p></div>"
49,spring,2002,s2002,gucci,"Forget fitted silhouettes and uptight elegance. Tom Ford is ushering in a relaxed, laid-back feeling at Gucci.</p><p>Ford's new aesthetic marries hip-hop savoir faire—ultra-casual pants and asymmetrical-seam jackets were cut extra-wide—with Route 66 favorites like raw suede blazers, desert tops, and large coats that lace in the back. A stunning liquidy silk skirt was embellished with large floral cutouts; explorer shorts were worn with skimpy superfine knits. Ford showed gently gathered smocks and a double-layered black dress riveted with diminutive eyelet hooks—furthering the fresh spin on the romantic concepts he has explored of late.</p><p>While not everyone will embrace Ford's new supersized proportions, there is bound to be unanimous enthusiasm for his self-assured evening gowns: frothy Empire concoctions that fall to the floor, with draped backs that offer a voyeuristic peek at the rigorously laced corsets underneath.</p></div>"
50,spring,2002,s2002,halston,"This is Craig Natiello's fourth season at Halston, a house with a glorious past whose recent history has been somewhat tumultuous.</p><p>Today Halston is the place to turn for special-occasion dressing, particularly if you are looking for a printed or embellished column dress for a night on the town. Among the best looks from the Spring collection are a black Empire-waist floor-length dress with center-front slit, and a navy-and-white overblown silk floral.</p><p>Natiello's reign at Halston continues the long tradition of Seventh Avenue dress- and suit-makers rather than that of Roy Halston Frowick, a true innovator, whose legacy continues to have an important influence on designers today.</p></div>"
51,spring,2002,s2002,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow has officially arrived. Stepping into the London void left by Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan, who will show in Paris this season, the South African-born Morrow staged a concise, all-white collection that was imaginative, rigorous and thoroughly convincing.</p><p>The 33-year-old designer juxtaposed five fabrics in a performance that had girls walking, in white boxing boots, through a shallow vat of violet dye. Morrow worked high-tech Aertex and reflective nylon with Old World damask, organdy and voile, cutting some superb tailored jackets and romantic skirts that ended up trailing their asymmetric hemlines into the colored liquid. The spirit was that of a sporty, otherworldly warrior woman—an image crystallized by a girl in a massive shawl of shredded organdy and a pair of shorts, like some athletic archangel.</p><p>For all the complex styling, which bound elastic webbing around torsos and slung glass-bead harnesses across garments, this collection had clarity beyond the usual grasp of experimental newcomers. (Morrow, who was a contemporary of Chalayan's at Central Saint Martins and studied menswear at London's Royal College of Art, honed his skills as a freelance designer at Byblos, under John Bartlett, and elsewhere.) This is a designer expressing his own independent vision, and it looks good.</p></div>"
52,spring,2002,s2002,helmut-lang,"Mixing romanticism, sex, and science, Helmut Lang's Spring 2002 collection balanced flesh-baring cutouts and bondage-style harnesses with Great Gatsby-style femininity.</p><p>Lang played hard and soft off against each other throughout the show. Strappy body suits were worn under flapper-like dresses or paired with pleated skirts; patent and metallic leather mingled with soft, sensual materials including silk chiffon and even perch skin. The angular geometry of pleats, v-necks and mirrored minaudières, meanwhile, was countered by rounder, arched necklines and open-toed shoes.</p><p>Lang added vibrancy to a severe palette of black, white and gray via dashes of deep red and purple, as well as prints designed in-house. One of these featured wings; another, though it resembled leopard spots, was in fact a rendering of biological cells.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""34x9m""></div></div><p>Originally scheduled to be shown on the catwalk in Paris, Lang's collection is instead being presented via the Internet, CD-ROM, lookbooks and showtapes (echoing the designer's successful alternative show format of 1998). ""I am sure that everybody will understand that I have to be in New York right now,"" Lang says. ""Presenting the Helmut Lang collection here is our way of supporting business in New York.""</p></div>"
53,spring,2002,s2002,hermes,"The look <em>Vogue</em> favored from Martin Margiela’s Spring 2002 collection for Hermès was crisp and conservative. “British Empire spic-and-span” is how the magazine described the white cotton shirt, canvas skirt, and canvas and leather riding boots Steven Meisel photographed on Karolina Kurkova.</p><p>But with the exception of those boots, this collection was not at all horsey—camp shirts and khakis evoking vast Saharan prairies rather than paddocks. Adding an urban accent to the proceedings were the wide black leather bandeaux that kept the models’ hair away from their faces.</p></div>"
54,spring,2002,s2002,imitation-of-christ,"For Imitation of Christ, the designer collective of Matthew Damhave and Tara Subkoff (and creative director Chloë Sevigny), fashion is one-third clothes and two-thirds performance. In past seasons, they have lured journalists to funeral parlors and hit them up for money; this time around, they decided to switch the roles of editors and models.</p><p>With RuPaul's ""Supermodel, work!"" playing at full volume as a backdrop, editors were lined up and ushered into a makeshift runway flanked by an audience of models equipped with pad and paper. As comments like ""Move along, please!"" and ""She's gained so much weight!"" blared through the speakers, the models-turned-journalists took notes and studiously ogled the press parade. Needless to say, they were all wearing Imitation's salvaged, recycled, one-of-a-kind tiered frocks, pouf minidresses, graffiti-scribbled Bermuda shorts and lace vests. Blazers were unceremoniously slashed and reconfigured, dresses tied at the hem, and skirts draped and ruched haphazardly. Amid all the madness, Imitation of Christ managed to produce some great-looking pieces.</p><p>Most importantly, though, magazine folk now know what it feels like to be a top model. All we need now is to start making their salaries….</p></div>"
55,spring,2002,s2002,jasper-conran,"London fashion week got off to a quiet but determined start, in spite of cancellations by Paul Smith, Clements Ribeiro, Katharine Hamnett and Burberry. Jasper Conran set the tone by issuing a defiant statement of intent, saying the ""objectives of terrorism are not only to kill but also to disrupt. … It is not our intention to allow these people to prevail by bowing out of … our responsibility … to our industry and democracy.""</p><p>Conran followed with a collection that reflects the taste of the heartland of Tony Blair's new Britain—accessible, understandable dressing for grown-ups who haven't forgotten how to flirt. Working with pimento, black and white, he incorporated subtle '30s and '40s references into silk polka-dot dresses and blouses, sharpened by tailoring, sometimes in napa.</p><p>At his best, Conran proves himself a worthy successor to Jean Muir, whose remit was always beautiful jersey cut for Brit sophisticates. The element of slinkiness in his sinuous black jersey dresses showed him at the top of his form, proving why he is one of London's most commercial designers: Aside from this collection, he reaches the whole of Britain through 96 branches of the Debenhams department store, for whom he designs extensive ranges under the label ""J.""</p></div>"
56,spring,2002,s2002,jean-paul-gaultier,"Buddhist-monk chic? In Jean Paul Gaultier's ethnic potpourri of a world, the concept is not only possible—it's inevitable.</p><p>With serene models wafting onstage in extralong skirts, draped tops and flowing dresses with trains that doubled as wraps, Gaultier brought India to the Carrousel du Louvre. Skillfully blending eastern and western influences, the designer deconstructed masculine suiting to create a three-tiered silhouette of sharp blazers, skirt overlays and straight trousers. Best of all were his sunny ruffled skirts and ruched dresses, which radiated positive energy.</p><p>""I've always been inspired by different cultures, and I discovered that in Buddhism orange is the color of peace and liberty,"" said Gaultier backstage. ""I wanted to convey a positive message of global communion."" He succeeded.</p></div>"
57,spring,2002,s2002,jil-sander,"More than a year after parting with its eponymous designer, Jil Sander is still struggling to find its footing as a world-class designer label.</p><p>Milan Vukmirovic, who was appointed creative director of the house less than a year ago, provided a tepid follow-up to his Fall debut. While there were several perfectly proper, wearable pieces—a great woven-leather coat, sharply cut blazers and a smart little caftan dress with flat sandals—the overall mood of the show was that of a nonevent. Vukmirovic's leather chemises and evening halter dresses, all in muted tones, failed to convey a strong sense of emotion.</p><p>Successful minimalist design requires an extremely precise sense of rigor, one that the Jil Sander design team must carefully pinpoint in order to maintain their status as a news-making brand.</p></div>"
58,spring,2002,s2002,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart has a knack for zeroing in on the prevailing fashion trends and then translating them into affordable clothes that her youthful clientele can understand.</p><p>For Spring, Stuart played up several of last season's key themes. Bohemian romanticism was much in evidence, via flowing, embroidered robes, gauzy washed-cotton dresses, wide-knit shawls, multi-tiered, ruffled skirts, and large, fringed bags that could have been found on the set of <em>Almost Famous</em>. With distressed cotton jackets and puff-sleeve shirts, Stuart also picked up on the street-cool look that Marc Jacobs has honed with his Marc line, throwing in bondage pants and cut-off utility shorts for good measure.</p><p>What else could one possibly add to the mix? Stuart went for wide, metallic belts, and flat sandals with impossibly long, scalloped straps that crisscrossed their way up to the models' knees.</p></div>"
59,spring,2002,s2002,joe-casely-hayford,"The mere fact that Joe Casely-Hayford has had a 15-year career in London makes him some kind of a national veteran—certainly considering all those who have been in and out of business during that time. His beat has always been easy, naive clothes with an off-kilter, homespun charm, and the look still has an appealing freshness and lack of pretension.</p><p>Casely-Hayford's Spring 2002 collection, called ""Pretty Hard,"" incorporates puff-sleeve blouses, skirts with layered ruffles, and vests with cow horns studded on the back, all in a South American, tobacco-and-sand palette. While everything looks natural and almost homemade, the designer says he's working with luxury, high-tech fabric that is ""made to look low-tech""—like a pair of hand-painted smock dresses, in a mix of cotton and silk, that ended his show.</p></div>"
60,spring,2002,s2002,john-galliano,"Once again, John Galliano staged an extravagant ethnic mishmash.</p><p>An imposing checkered snakeskin zoot suit paved the way for Mexican-beaded shirts and suits, wide denim ensembles embroidered with cars, and a great knitted Andean coat. Galliano also showed some beautiful quieter pieces that were sometimes eclipsed by the flashier outfits: Standouts included a piped pale-blue blazer, side-ruched trousers and pretty tea dresses. (These could have done without their bungee-cord multiloop belts.)</p><p>Galliano is a fantastic storyteller who can meld diverse influences like few others. The insistence with which he drives this point home, however, is making it virtually impossible to distinguish his work at Dior from that of his signature line.</p></div>"
61,spring,2002,s2002,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald has joined the ranks of designers who must work two collections in two countries—a daunting task, even for some of fashion's top talents. Unsurprising, then, that signs of strain were evident in Macdonald's first collection for his own label since taking up his post at Givenchy just a few months ago.</p><p>Macdonald's show, staged in the London Science Museum, looked as if a sudden awareness of posh European fashion had descended and smothered the designer's usual brash clubbiness. References to haute Parisian fashion were all too visible—the tooled leather belts and cargo pockets Tom Ford has used; the Givenchy-esque Bettina blouse; the heavy, couturelike flowered satin; the Versace-flavor spangly minidress. Even Macdonald's own signature asymmetric near-naked disco dresses misfired, at a time when the validity of good-time clothes suddenly looks very questionable.</p><p>As a relative unknown outside London, Macdonald will have to work harder to show a world audience the difference between his hometown collection and Givenchy. Still, Alexander McQueen struggled to find his feet at Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs took several seasons to warm up at Louis Vuitton, while their own labels have occasionally wobbled under the workload. So give the boy time.</p></div>"
62,spring,2002,s2002,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli knows her customer well: hip, downtown girls who appreciate the trends but would never dream of looking like overeager fashion victims.</p><p>Adeli’s collection was focused and to the point. Black fringe tanks worn with super-skinny eyelet jeans are sure to turn up on customers’ most-wanted lists; ditto for the hand-tooled leather jackets and wide low-slung belts. Gunmetal silk jersey tops, frayed trousers and crepe dresses with sheer insets were all sexy and modern. When it looked like the collection could veer toward the predictable, Adeli wisely softened her street-tough silhouette with billowy, oversized tops, fringed cowgirl vests and casual batik skirts.</p><p>Like other designers, Adeli touched upon the Victorian and peasant aesthetics that Balenciaga and Saint Laurent have made so popular this fall, but she managed to move beyond obvious references to create an identity of her own.</p></div>"
63,spring,2002,s2002,lawrence-steele,"Known for his love of simple luxury, Lawrence Steele turned up the volume this season with a collection that evoked the formfitting sexiness of old-school Hollywood.</p><p>Steele relied on severe pencil skirts, flared at the knee, and strapless gowns to create an ultra-curvaceous silhouette. Fifties-inspired dresses swished with every turn, while stretch tops anchored large floral-print skirts. For evening, Steele turned to leopard-spot beading; his tuxedo featured a blinding gold sequin vest in lieu of a conventional shirt. Steele indulged his sense of humor by embroidering a large, cursive ""L"" (last seen on '70s sitcom <em>Laverne &amp; Shirley</em>) on loose cardigans that are meant to be worn backward.</p><p>Not everything worked, however. Several of Steele's ruched skirts and dresses looked simply old-fashioned, and there were times when the self-conscious glamour was laid on too thick. An occasional touch of restraint would have been welcome.</p></div>"
64,spring,2002,s2002,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs could not have chosen a better note with which to close the Spring 2002 collections—his Louis Vuitton show perfectly captured the dreamy, romantic aesthetic that has dominated the season.</p><p>One of the many feats Jacobs pulled off was to make snakeskin soft and demure. His gently scalloped silver python skirts and cropped jackets conveyed not a hint of aggression, while a delicate snake trim also surfaced on a mini-suit and several perky dresses. Elsewhere, Jacobs offered some of the best peasant dresses around—A-lined, swimming with delicate paisley prints, and grazing the floor. The same silhouette was used for the empire washed denim robes, which gave the humble fabric an air of grandeur. Lamé jackets with naif embroideries are just the thing to throw over any of these superb dresses.</p><p>This is clearly the season to invest in Louis Vuitton accessories. After the street-inspired (and by now ubiquitous) graffiti totes, what better change of pace than a sweet butterfly, mouse or winking owl bag?</p></div>"
65,spring,2002,s2002,luella,"It seems that prairie girls are here to stay, at least according to Luella Bartley, who decamped to New York this season. To a blaring soundtrack that included everything from “Sweet Home Alabama” to “Get Ur Freak On,” the London designer sent out a cavalcade of country gals decked out in trailblazer skirts, embroidered dresses, off-the-shoulder tops, frayed denim skirts, and Navajo-inspired wrap coats in vivid colors.</p><p>The American West motif eventually gave way to an array of candy-colored looks that included a playful pink-and-blue striped blazer, a piped rose sundress and several bright yellow knits that will be just the thing for a summer weekend in Malibu. Bartley’s accessories also hit the mark: The outrageous combination of Pocahontas leather socks, pink cowgirl boots, wide-brim floppy hats, multicolored woven belts with streamers (courtesy of Katie Hillier), dangling fur tails and feather embellishments somehow managed to make perfect sense.</p><p>If the audience’s gaze occasionally strayed off the runway, don’t blame Bartley. The sight of Venus and Serena Williams in the front row, the next day after their historic U.S. Open match, proved too much for most to resist.</p></div>"
66,spring,2002,s2002,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The fun, practical, mix-and-matchable clothes in Marc Jacobs' junior line are fast making it a style beacon for hip, plugged-in girls around the country.</p><p>Jacobs steers clear of female fashion stereotypes: Marc is not about debutantes, punk princesses or cheerleaders, but about cool girls who follow their own rules. Urban warriors will go for a shrunken, revamped military jacket or an army-green, eyelet-hook parka; retro babes will prefer the fruit-colored tops and folksy smocks; California girls can't go wrong with shorts, rainbow-striped jeans and flimsy knit tops.</p><p>Still only in its third season, Marc continues to grow by leaps and bounds. For Spring 2002 there are flirty floral bikinis, more accessories than ever, and jeans and sweatshirts for boys. Large denim totes, striped lace-up wedges, butterfly platforms and canvas sneakers make the perfect exclamation points for these energetic looks.</p></div>"
67,spring,2002,s2002,marc-jacobs,"After Marc Jacobs' high-powered presentation, it's official: Spring is all about color. Designers are staging a backlash against fall's somber mood, and Jacobs is spearheading it.</p><p>Using a long pier off Manhattan's Meatpacking District as his runway, Jacobs presented what is sure to become one of the season's most influential collections. Lilac shirts, marigold pants, dandelion sweaters, and sweet tulip-print dresses brought to mind a Berkeley student listening to Donovan or the Strawberry Alarm Clock in the late sixties—if flower children had ever displayed such a witty way with proportions and chromatic combinations. Mack-daddy suits with wide lapels, plenty of topstitching, and generous bell-bottoms were worn with pale plum shirts; a folksy collage jacket was trimmed with vivid printed bands and paired with a blueberry suede skirt. Rainbow jersey dresses, floral-print halters, and petal-embroidered shirts were simultaneously sweet and mischievous.</p><p>When the show ended to thunderous applause, a faux backstage wall magically parted, allowing guests like Sarah Jessica Parker, Gretchen Mol, Hilary Swank, Lisa Marie, Donald Trump, and Monica Lewinsky to venture into the backroom. Jacobs had created an elaborate party space overlooking the Hudson River, complete with grass-covered floors, picnic tables overflowing with fresh fruit, and even a fire boat that sprayed jets of water in the distance.</p></div>"
68,spring,2002,s2002,markus-lupfer,"The things to watch at Markus Lupfer are his twists on leather and print. This German-born designer, who trained with Clements Ribeiro, has gathered a following among editors and shoppers alike for designs that are interesting, without ever making a girl look like a freak.</p><p>This show was high on femininity, color and detail. Lupfer opened with a flouncy skirt and sleeveless top decorated with vibrantly colored and patterned paperwork, like something derived from a South American carnival. It wasn't a costume parade, though: He followed up with photo-printed cashmeres and blouses, and intricately pieced superfine leather skirts and dresses cut and made so cleverly they almost looked like fabric. Some all-white looks—right down to belts and sneakers—hit a general Summer trend, while Aertex popped up again as a fabric of the moment.</p><p>When Spring comes around, Lupfer's collection will be a place to snap up a few frills and some nice color, plus—new to him this season—belts, bags and shoes.</p></div>"
69,spring,2002,s2002,marni,"Marni designer Consuelo Castiglioni turned out a timely, finely tuned collection with a folksy, romantic feel.</p><p>Castiglioni began with her most ambitiously layered looks, then gradually pared them down as if to allow the audience to take in the abundance of details. Few labels can pull off mismatched prints better than Marni; here, striped trousers and low-slung girly skirts stood out under sweet floral tops decorated with silver paillettes. Bright blazers, frayed-edge jackets, and a great mink vest that can be reduced to half its length with the pull of a zipper all looked just right. Nomadic fashionistas, meanwhile, will be drawn to Castiglioni's large, low-slung bags laden with pins, rhinestones, dangling chains and furry tails.</p><p>Milan's news of the day: For the first time ever, Castiglioni showed several carefully crafted men's looks, providing a relaxed alternative to the strict tailoring that has dominated most recent menswear collections.</p></div>"
70,spring,2002,s2002,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon draws on an eclectic mix of sources and has consistently explored both feminized menswear and a vintage, flea-market aesthetic.</p><p>It was hardly surprising, then, when antique-looking camisoles, washed denim skirts and distressed ruffle dresses all turned up on her runway, often coupled with mannish pinstripe blazers or vests. While several individual pieces worked well—notably the ecru coats, aged suede jackets and slim trousers—the overall effect of this collection was one of frenetic aimlessness. Sitbon's straightforward jabot dresses, Edwardian smocks and velvet-trimmed bits of flounce slipped too easily into the realm of kitsch. It's one thing to reference and update the past, but quite another to look like you're on your way to a costume party.</p></div>"
71,spring,2002,s2002,matthew-williamson,"Matthew Williamson dubbed his concise, feel-good collection ""Nu-topia,"" evoking the sort of acid-house resort—think Ibiza, Goa or Phuket—where girls (and boys this season) just want to have fun.</p><p>""Today you are panthers,"" read the backstage instructions board for the models, ""sleek, strong, sexy."" In fact, his girls were more fragile than predatory, in fluttering chiffon handkerchief point dresses and tops, ombré-printed with fluorescent rainbow colors. Skintight denim jeans (worn with Christian Louboutin's coin-fringed disco sandals) were patched with quirky assemblages of golden lace and neon-bright butterfly appliqués; even All Star baseball boots were customized with embroidered patchworks made from scraps of antique Maltese lace. (Backstage, the designer was wearing a length as a necktie.)</p><p>Fringed ponchos, micro-minis, patchwork elephant-leg jeans and shredded silky knits may not have been the freshest fashion news, but Williamson's elaborate detailing and neon palette (with white, gold and bleached blue) made them very much his own. ""I thought it was fantastic—The End,"" squeaked It girl and Rolling Stones scion Leah Woods.</p></div>"
72,spring,2002,s2002,michael-kors-collection,"""I really appreciate the fact that we have all come together,"" said a newly mustachioed Michael Kors before his showroom presentation. ""Let's be cheerleaders for all that New York has to offer, because this is the most amazing city in the world.""</p><p>Kors' positive outlook was evident in a concise collection that brought to mind the best of Halston, with an injection of movie-star glamour (his update on the giant tie-strap tote bag is destined to become a collectible). Alongside beachy getaway clothes, more sophisticated urban looks included chinoiserie-inspired red lacquer cardigans and sweatshirts, georgette halter dresses, and brush-stroke skirts (upon close inspection, some of the abstract prints proved to be expressionist MK logos). Evening took a turn for the dramatic with slinky bandeau columns and stunning black-and-gold embroidered tulle shells and shifts.</p><p>Kors' practical yet lighthearted collection struck a chord that is likely to resonate throughout this season.</p></div>"
73,spring,2002,s2002,miguel-adrover,"Over the past year, Miguel Adrover has traveled several times to Egypt, bringing back with him images of flowing djellabas, loose harem pants and floor-length monastic skirts. For Spring, Adrover continued to explore Middle Eastern-inspired themes with everything from ornate skirts embellished with tassels and leather waistbands, to colorful patchwork wraps and skirts quilted with elaborate lattice patterns. Long, delicately printed desert dresses were worn under strict colonial blazers, and trouser suits were pegged at the ankle.</p><p>The ethnic journey began with serene, austere peasant tunics, but eventually gave way to a crescendo of primary colors. A tongue-in-cheek Jamaican-themed segment consisted of red, black, yellow and green suits; a long column gown was painted with an extraordinary Middle Eastern vista. Model Oluchi, enveloped in layers of multihued chiffon, resembled a nomadic tribal goddess.</p><p>Adrover's collection was very beautiful—and, as usual, long and uncompromising. Not everything will be for everyone, but at a time when cookie-cutter fashion is increasingly commonplace, Adrover’s independent spirit is more relevant than ever.</p></div>"
74,spring,2002,s2002,missoni,"With fashion designers turning to the hippie-dippy '60s and '70s for inspiration, Missoni's bold contrasting prints are enjoying a moment in the sun.</p><p>Missoni put a decadent, luxurious spin on folksy romanticism. Handkerchief tops were printed to resemble tie-dye treatments; Native American-inspired embellishments adorned jacket sleeves, carrier bags and the back of a raw tab-collar coat. A fluorescent acrylic palette of yellow and cobalt blue referenced early Bob Dylan style, as did the shredded-patchwork and loom-net skirts, shawl tops and butterfly trousers.</p><p>Missoni's eveningwear dazzled with metallic, optic swirl dresses sporting fringed hems. Baby-doll frocks, silver beaded tops and extrawide copper trousers will all look great with high-heeled espadrilles—the footwear of choice for Missoni bohemians.</p></div>"
75,spring,2002,s2002,miu-miu,"Miuccia Prada was in a romantic, youthful mood at Miu Miu, updating the prairie themes that have been so popular on other runways.</p><p>Miu Miu's take on home-on-the-range dressing was livened up by delicate ethnic touches—like Moroccan-inspired embroidery on full-bodied, pleated skirts that dance at the knee. Long, tiered skirts make the transition from country to city style when worn with peppy floral button-downs and smart little cardigans. At times, things got just a little too girly—it's hard to imagine anyone past 16 wearing a Little Red Riding Hood smock with gathered short sleeves. On the other hand, there were plenty of simpler, breezier camisoles that will work as chic, simple Summer staples.</p><p>For the practically minded, Prada included an assortment of sensible pantsuits and boyish blazers—perfect for a new generation of career girls.</p></div>"
76,spring,2002,s2002,moschino,"Designer Vincent Dare, who until recently worked at Fendi, has taken over the reigns at Moschino, presenting one of the most spirited collections that label has seen in years.</p><p>Humor has always been a key ingredient at Moschino, and Dare made the most of it. Iconic '80s Chanel diva Inès de la Fressange opened the show, wearing a whimsical reinterpretation of the signature Chanel bouclé suit. The T-shirt underneath, meanwhile, was printed with a haughty put-down from Karl Lagerfeld: ""Moschino n'est pas un style, c'est un pastiche!"" As a riposte, Dare then introduced some great ruffled skirts, lightly beaded caftans, and a great horizontal-pleat dress that had gold coins nestled within the folds. Other urban suggestions included sharp pantsuits with ribbon detailing, a paillette-trimmed trench, and a crumpled tux that looked like it had been pulled prematurely from the dryer.</p><p>Playfully recalling Moschino's prominence in the '80s, Dare also sent ex-models Lynn Koester and Violeta Sanchez down the runway. They clearly enjoyed their comeback cameos.</p></div>"
77,spring,2002,s2002,narciso-rodriguez,"In the world of Narciso Rodriguez, ""trendy"" is a dirty word. Avoiding gimmickry at all costs, Rodriguez relies on precise cutting and obsessive attention to detail to create a minimal—and lasting—elegance.</p><p>With a nod, perhaps, to the almost ritualistic pleasure of getting dressed, Rodriguez showed cotton toile jackets and poplin cutout dresses fastened by rows of tiny eyelet hooks. His version of the classic white shirt was carefully seamed and paneled, turning it, in effect, into a light, fitted jacket. Transparency and layering were important themes: a crepe de chine U-neck dress really came to life when a wrap skirt was thrown over it. Rodriguez's most dramatic statement was a stunning glass tube short-sleeve dress, which seemed to reflect every light in the room.</p><p>Anyone blessed with an accessories fetish knows that Rodriguez is currently producing some of the best shoes around. This season's sky-high, pointy ankle-strap stilettos are his best yet.</p></div>"
78,spring,2002,s2002,olivier-theyskens,"Although Olivier Theyskens has always been inspired by history, particularly the Victorian era, he uses old techniques to create clothes that are thoroughly, dramatically new.</p><p>Theysken's elaborate evening statements, in bold colors like electric green, orange crush and canary yellow, were feats of construction that incorporated imperiously ruffled, asymmetric skirts and cinched eyelet-hook corsets with a tiny shirt attached at the front. A brushed leather coat came with a bustled back, but did not look out of place among the more conventional trenches. In fact, Theyskens maintained a light, balanced mood throughout, showing sharp basics like light polo knits, a stunning gold silk skirt, and even a series of humble everyday cotton dresses.</p><p>This was a precisely conceived, consistent collection that will only further Theyskens' growing reputation.</p></div>"
79,spring,2002,s2002,oscar-de-la-renta,"Oscar de la Renta began his condensed showroom presentation by distributing American-flag armbands to editors and buyers, and making sure models wore them with his outfits.</p><p>De la Renta's vibrant, positive collection was focused on daintily embroidered linen dresses, printed silk camisoles and gypsy-like ruffled skirts. Dreamy silk muslin petal dresses, officers' khaki cotton jackets and a striking palm-print jumpsuit brought to mind the tropical chic of colonial Indochine—by way of the Beverly Hills Hotel. For evening, eyelet blouses were paired with big, dramatic tulle skirts and accessorized with diamond-trimmed satin sandals. A double-faced charmeuse tuxedo with a white linen blouse was strikingly chic in its simplicity.</p><p>""When I started designing clothes I was full of spirit and passion,"" said the Dominican-born de la Renta. ""Today, 35 years later, that joy is still there. I am glad that I came to this country and happy to be an American.""</p></div>"
80,spring,2002,s2002,philosophy,"Philosophy, Alberta Ferretti's junior line, is known for its ethereal, delicate dresses. This season, however, Ferretti imbued her lightweight frocks with a decidedly street-tough edge.</p><p>Not that there was any shortage of Ferretti's signature embellishments: In fact, practically every look seemed awash in pleats and ruffles. But the designer cut her smocks and skirts extra wide, employed neutral colors, and styled them with Mad Max verve. (Ferretti's models usually waft onto the runway; this time, they stomped in and out at breakneck speed.) Unfinished tops peeked out from cropped, ribbed cardigans; laser-cut details spruced up long, casual skirts. A frayed, pleated pale rose dress with an asymmetric hem could be just the thing a young urban warrior would want to throw on to combat a summer heat wave.</p><p>For those in search of a practical dress with plenty of attitude, Philosophy is certainly one place to turn.</p></div>"
81,spring,2002,s2002,prada,"Combining '50s notions of jet-set elegance with couturelike fabrics and exquisite ethnic references, Miuccia Prada triumphantly opened Milan fashion week.</p><p>Set to a dreamy instrumental soundtrack, Prada's show began with tailored navy skirts, trousers with built-in, low-slung belts, silvery lattice-print shirts, and kittenish Sabrina heels. Then came an exquisite homage to vintage Chanel, with belted, gold-threaded bouclé dresses—just the kind of stunning little outfits Romy Schneider would have sported in the early '60s. Prada's pajama-style chemises with Turkish motifs projected nonchalant, understated chic; the pin-tucked frilly tops and skirts trimmed with a vertical ruffle strip referenced fashion's infatuation with all things romantic, but steered clear of clichés.</p><p>As usual, Prada saved the best for last. In contrast to the dour palette that many designers have adopted lately, her runway positively dazzled. Nude tops and dresses were layered with lightweight, shimmering knits; paneled, imposing skirts glowed under crinkled gold tops and coppery brocade jackets. The result? A vision of bygone splendor that never devolved into gratuitous flash.</p></div>"
82,spring,2002,s2002,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren capitalized on fashion's current infatuation with Americana, mixing and matching romantic home-on-the-range elements with more rugged, vintage-inspired pieces.</p><p>Playing with white, sand and ivory, Lauren went for small, fitted jackets and low-rise, boot-cut trousers; flirty ruffles softened up blouses and long, full skirts. Shawls and ponchos surfaced in various forms: dramatically fringed, tied around the waist and embroidered with an assortment of flowers. Lauren did not, however, neglect his customers' need for everyday urban simplicity—his essential pantsuit came in beige wool gabardine with handpicked detailing. An ivory silk charmeuse pant and jacket ensemble provided a relaxed spin on the tuxedo.</p><p>Highlights of the collection included a beaded, scalloped camisole paired with natural deerskin jeans, and the combination of an embroidered tulle skirt, white linen shirt and distressed leather jacket that closed his show.</p></div>"
83,spring,2002,s2002,richard-edwards,"Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick, who together make up the label Richard Edwards, are clearly not about flash. They rely on precision of cut and careful details to make their confident, urban clothes.</p><p>Flounces and ruffles have been practically everywhere this season, and Bengtsson and Pavlick used some of these decorative elements in the most discreet way possible. Single ruffled trims inched their way up the side of straight trousers or around the neckline of functional, sleeveless tanks. Silk piping, satin insets and string laces dressed up everything from sexy pantsuits to understated shift dresses, while shoulder cutouts lent a touch of cool to casual everyday tops.</p><p>Bengtsson and Pavlick's minimalism extended to the show's styling. See-through ballet slippers carefully matched the outfits' muted tones, while the simple ponytails and nude makeup worn by the models ensured that nothing distracted from the clothes.</p></div>"
84,spring,2002,s2002,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli closed Milan fashion week with his customary over-the-top bravura display.</p><p>""A modern fairy tale"" was how Cavalli described his sexy, folky collection. Laser-cut leather jackets and maxi coats were aged and distressed, as were his shirred, flouncy dresses, lace micro-skirts and hyper-decorated jeans. Cavalli's beloved leopard and floral prints turned up on baroque inlaid chiffons, silks and muslins; his show-stopping evening gowns could pass as couture lingerie, with their profusion of decadent embroideries, cutouts and trimmings.</p><p>Before taking his bow, Cavalli sent out a procession of short—but equally arresting—dresses. Think of them as a slightly more approachable introduction to the designer's high-intensity, maximal vision.</p></div>"
85,spring,2002,s2002,roland-mouret,"A Frenchman working in London, Roland Mouret combines the romance of the couture tradition with the grit of his adopted city to make beautiful, edgy eveningwear.</p><p>Mouret kept his audience spellbound with a collection of black asymmetric dresses, falling from the body in rivulets of fabric, contrasted with shots of sharp, gentlemanly suiting. Upping the romantic quotient was the look of the girls, who wore no-makeup makeup with a slightly fevered sheen and ever-so-slightly tousled hair, as if caught at 3 a.m. at some fantastic ball. Luxury was also in plentiful supply: Mouret has the real thing, in the form of a new collection of rough diamond jewelry, made in association with mining company Oryx. The signature pins Mouret has always used to anchor fabric in a dress are now capped with a sugar-cube-size chunk of raw ice, while pendants and wisps of silver bracelets swing with very serious rocks. Show-stoppers? A dusty pink, huge-sleeved georgette blouse tethered to the torso with a massive wooden bead necklace; a delicate layered sheath of chiffon in cutout black flowers; and a white corseted top with a 3-D, raw-edged bouquet of fabric flowering at one shoulder.</p><p>If there are to be occasions in the future, these are the kind of clothes clued-up women will dream of wearing to them.</p></div>"
86,spring,2002,s2002,ruffo-research,"Since launching their Research line in 1998, which is entrusted to a different designer every year, Ruffo Research has become an important talent scout in Milan. This season, Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, who have already made a name for themselves with the playful collections they’ve designed under their signature label, Alexandre Matthieu, brought an infusion of lighthearted energy to the Ruffo runway.</p><p>Treating leather like fabric, the duo sent out punched-suede camisoles, perky little suits trimmed with delicate buckles, and great shift dresses with dangling chrysanthemum cutouts. The pièce de résistance was a distressed leather-strip skirt, which swished and sashayed as if it were pleated chiffon. Bureau and Morgado also devised a logo for the brand, in the form of glittery R’s that turned up on dresses and shirts.</p><p>In the past, Ruffo Research has employed talents as diverse as Antonio Berardi, Raf Simons and Veronique Branquinho, An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, and Sophia Kokosalaki. With fashion editors and clients constantly on the hunt for new ideas, the Ruffo team clearly understands that promoting innovation is not only desirable, but in some cases absolutely necessary.</p></div>"
87,spring,2002,s2002,russell-sage,"Russell Sage puts his collections together by reworking antique pieces to incorporate symbolic commentaries. This one started with a tableau of four models in short-sleeve cotton dresses with animal skins draped over them. (The show notes pointed out that the zebras and tigers on display had been shot in the 1880s and '90s.) These were followed by more dresses onto which oil paintings of John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney and Julien Macdonald had been sewn. Today's big-game trophies are fashion labels—geddit?</p><p>Sage's quip didn't exactly rock the aisles, but his show had plenty of other treasures worth looking at—all made from a haul of Victorian patchwork, hunting jackets, embroidered Chinese silk and vintage nightshirts. Underneath the asymmetrical complexities, the color and shape of the dresses—often done with intricate pleating and a romantic full-skirted silhouette—was beautiful. Standouts were the designer's neat, short evening jackets, especially one in antique damask with a black organza ruffle bursting from a lapel. It's a compliment to Sage that, despite the heritage fabrics, this looks like a believable modern collection rather than a costume show.</p></div>"
88,spring,2002,s2002,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford was in fine form at Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, sending out his most laid-back, relaxed collection to date.</p><p>The big news was the arrival—finally—of prints at YSL Rive Gauche, in the form of leopard spots. Ford paired sheer little feline tanks with rustic leather skirts dissected by minute rows of crisscrossed laces; this folksy embellishment also turned up on road-warrior trousers, sexy swimsuits and a fabulous ecru trench. Ring-studded leather jackets, unfinished suede skirts and rough-edge coats looked drop-dead cool with stacked heel sandals and large, half-oval carrier bags.</p><p>Come spring, Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche evenings will be all about unassuming glamour. Ford's new golden leopard caftan robes are worthy of the queen of the jungle—just the thing for a night of decadent mischief.</p></div>"
89,spring,2002,s2002,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel is synonymous with elegant, typically French clothes, and this season was no exception.</p><p>Rykiel started out with a couple of lean black jackets tucked into high-waist trousers, but quickly moved on to her beloved trompe-l'oeil sweaters embroidered to look like smokings or sailor uniforms; others spelled out words like <em>diamant</em> or <em>rubis</em> in glittering paillettes. Other fun-loving basics included lollipop-colored frilly dresses, striped poplin skirts and sporty everyday jackets. Rykiel's asymmetric evening dresses featured lingerie-inspired lace trims; her crumpled hooded jackets, shirts and trousers were held together with utility belts that had built-in cases which doubled as little flower pots.</p><p>Rykiel's bathing suits were some of the most original of the season. Her black bikinis and one-piece maillots were dangerously sheer, with strategically placed striped insets.</p></div>"
90,spring,2002,s2002,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki knows exactly who she is and what she is about. An Athenian working in London, it has taken her just a few seasons to develop a consistently strong, feminine aesthetic.</p><p>Kokosalaki turned to her Mediterranean roots for the first time this Summer in a collection she described as ""Minoan Pagan""—a reference to the ancient Cretan civilization of King Minos. Specific influences were the terra cotta, tan and creamy colors of Cretan wall-painting and ceramics, and the cheesecloth and macramé of Greek peasant crafts. These were incorporated into her already distinctive way with leather (delicately twisted and embroidered bustiers and seamed jackets) and draped jersey (dresses with cobwebby inserts at the front, or slung about with dangly macramé belts).</p><p>Another new element was intricate pleating, which looked great on the bodice of the best piece in the collection: a high-waisted cheesecloth peasant dress with a keyhole opening, piped in cream.</p></div>"
91,spring,2002,s2002,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney’s debut collection after leaving Chloé fell far short of expectations.</p><p>McCartney’s flashy, boisterous parade featured risqué slogans, sometimes in Cockney rhyming slang, printed on practically all of her looks. An almost pornographic dress read “Slippery When Wet;” cropped T-shirts had “Raspberry Ripple” scribbled across the chest; a long coat encouraged observers to “Spank the Monkey.” Apart from these artless wannabe shockers, McCartney offered uninspired electric blue sequined pieces, mini-slips with trailing sleeves, and dresses with dotted-face designs courtesy of artist Gary Hume.</p><p>Although some of McCartney’s T-shirts and accessories (like the hard “Wet” case) could be commercially viable, her show clearly did not live up to the technical and creative standards expected of a major Gucci Group label.</p></div>"
92,spring,2002,s2002,strenesse,"Layering was the key to Gabriele Strehle's finely tuned Strenesse collection, an exercise in minimalist luxury.</p><p>Strehle began with large, crisp white shirts that doubled as short dresses, upon which she piled comforting cashmere jumpers and cropped cardigans, almost like layers of luxurious shielding. Leggings and high-waist pants made brief appearances, but for the most part it was the oversize jackets with drawstrings, asymmetric-hem sweater dresses and tunic-like chemises that stole the show. A muted palette of white, ecru, navy and black emphasized a loose, casual silhouette that was anchored with no-nonsense flat boots.</p><p>Strehle's understated aesthetic extended to her evening dresses: short, gathered Empire slips that look as comfortable as they are chic.</p></div>"
93,spring,2002,s2002,tomas-maier,"Most women spend a lot of time putting together their basic urban outfits—suits, party dresses and weekend staples—but leave shopping for that last-minute beach getaway until, well, the last minute.</p><p>Enter Tomas Maier, the German designer who has made a career out of treating swimwear just as seriously as any other component of a woman's wardrobe. Maier's sexy swimsuits range from itsy-bitsy, fire-engine-red bikinis to black, figure-flattering one-piece suits, and are decorated with everything from a rogue flower to lavish fringe. To cover the ground between beach and hotel, Maier provides silk jersey cover-ups and caftans, sensible track suits, shorts and tees.</p><p>""My clothes are designed exclusively for moments of leisure,"" says Maier. ""There are bathing suits, comfortable things for the plane, and even a little something to open the door when you order room service.""</p></div>"
94,spring,2002,s2002,ungaro-couture,"For the first time since establishing his eponymous fashion house in 1965, Emanuel Ungaro did not take a bow at the end of his show. Monsieur Ungaro has left his ready-to-wear line in the hands of creative director Giambattista Valli, and will now be directly responsible only for couture.</p><p>Valli's first effort was heavy on high-glamour '80s references. Trousers were baggy and pegged, jeans were covered in tulle, and jersey dresses were lavished with cascades of crystal pearls or printed with faces that could have been pulled from the pages of <em>Vogue</em>. It was the simpler pieces, however, that worked best. Valli's linen pantsuits and delicately embroidered muslin dresses, for example, were far more subtle and convincing than his awkward corset ensembles.</p><p>Valli has worked with Ungaro for several seasons now, and has taken important steps to update the label. With a bit more time, he should be able to hit a comfortable, consistent stride.</p></div>"
95,spring,2002,s2002,valentino,"A rich vein of Latin American glamour ran throughout Valentino's Spring collection, which was heavily decorated with ruffles, folksy embroidery and waist-nipping corset belts.</p><p>The designer's strong palette revolved around black, with flashes of banana, coral, aqua and lipstick red. But the emphasis was clearly on the silhouette, notably in some truly elaborate, beautiful pieces like smocked taffeta dresses with beaded georgette shawls, romantic chiffon tops and long skirts accented with turquoise and salmon embroidery. A shocking pink coat, worn with a ruffled shirt and shantung trousers, was in the best Valentino tradition.</p><p>As usual, the designer saved his best for after 5. (This is, after all, the man who dressed Julia Roberts for her Oscar victory and Jennifer Lopez for her recent wedding.) Come red-carpet time, celebrity stylists will have no trouble finding plenty of scene-making gowns. Standouts? A black georgette column with bows; the combination of a ruffle-front ivory shirt and a high-waist fire-engine taffeta skirt with lace inserts; and a shirred tulle Aleutian extravaganza.</p></div>"
96,spring,2002,s2002,vera-wang,"Few designers can match Vera Wang's command of discreet sophistication. In addition to producing ready-to-wear collections and running a made-to-order atelier, she has recently completed a substantial coffee-table book answering every possible question one could have about planning a wedding.</p><p>Wang is all about couture-like elegance. While there's nothing here in the way of sensible everyday separates, there are perfect little black dresses—one short georgette number has a ruffled skirt and a detachable bolero jacket; another, with cutout shoulders, is gently cinched at one side—and some very serious full evening looks. Among the best were a floor-length halter gown with fishtail hems and a long column with elastic leather straps.</p><p>There's no shortage of color in this collection, either, thanks to some stunning cocktail dresses in frothy, fruity shades. Standouts? The melon slip with a jeweled lace border and the printed chiffon halter with sequin fringe dangling from the neckline to the floor and around the waist.</p></div>"
97,spring,2002,s2002,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho was at her best for Spring, creating the kind of precisely conceived clothes that defy flash-in-the-pan trends to achieve classic status.</p><p>This is a designer who can make basics—prim, proper blazers paired with masculine white shirts and sharply creased trousers—look exceptional, thanks to her fastidious sense of proportion and color. Even that much reviled '80s staple, the acid-washed jean, looked dignified here, paired with a sharp jacket and glittery white pumps. A street-smart, no-nonsense parka was given an intriguing twist thanks to a tunnel belt and drawstring hem, while Branquinho's unassuming skirts and dresses, with their gentle pleats and asymmetric panels, were often belted nonchalantly with a wide men's tie.</p><p>Branquinho is one of those rare talents who can make the quietest statements speak volumes.</p></div>"
98,spring,2002,s2002,versace,"Newlywed Jennifer Lopez caused a major paparazzi meltdown at Versace as she wafted onto the multihued runway in a pearl-gray goddess gown that clung to her every curve.</p><p>Versace's collection could have been designed specifically for Lopez and her fellow members of the red-hot diva society. Severely form-fitting silhouettes in striking blues, violets and reds were the norm. The focus was on sensual details like rows of circular cutouts, lace-up closures and deep-plunging backs; fire-engine-red skirts were dotted with minute eyelets, while leather tops and grommet-trimmed dresses laced up provocatively in the back. Several eggshell suits and dresses provided a momentary chromatic respite before Donatella plunged into a series of pop-print floral dresses that could have sprung from a Warhol canvas. For evening there were low-waisted skirts with shimmering net overlays, embroidered tops, and a no-holds-barred beaded pink column.</p><p>To celebrate Lopez's wedding, Donatella threw a dinner bash at her Lake Como house, half an hour outside of Milan—the perfect conclusion to her high-octane presentation.</p></div>"
99,spring,2002,s2002,versus-versace,"Donatella Versace served up plenty of defiant attitude at Versus—just the kind of thing to delight fans like Lil' Kim, who was perched in her front-row seat wearing a barely-there miniskirt, curled blond locks and tall leather boots.</p><p>Black has been banned from the Versus girl's wardrobe in favor of steely grays and peachy pinks, punctuated by stiff injections of neon pink, acid yellow and aqua green. Donatella boldly paired striped spaghetti pants with a black-and-white floral-print blazer. Graffiti-print jackets and halter dresses matched her artfully decorated runway. For extra impact, there was an orange-pink mod coat with patent detailing.</p><p>Those Versus enthusiasts for whom clubbing comes as naturally as breathing did not go home disappointed, thanks to scalloped minidresses laden with rhinestones, tiered miniskirts, flouncy tops and snazzy ankle-sock booties in assorted colors.</p></div>"
100,spring,2002,s2002,viktor-rolf,"How could Dutch duo Viktor &amp; Rolf possibly follow their triumphant, all-black fall exploration of volumes and silhouettes? How else but with an effervescent, all-white spring exploration of… volumes and silhouettes.</p><p>Huge silver organ pipes provided a stunning backdrop for prim Balenciaga-inspired 1940's boxy jackets with oversize buttons, lace dresses with built-in belts, and bow-covered suits. The tuxedo—a mandatory piece in every Viktor &amp; Rolf collection—came in white and silver brocade, with a tidal wave of ruffles crashing forth from within its lapels. A rope-piped pantsuit, several heart-printed trousers and plenty of sheer shirts looked like commercial hits, but the truly outstanding items were the immense, double-and-triple-waist pleated skirts and massively oversized shirts and jackets. These sculptural masterpieces could easily pass as extravagant bridal dresses—not to mention being mistaken for particularly sumptuous wedding cakes.</p><p>“The collection is about love and goodness and being positive—that's all we can really say about it,” said Rolf after the show. “For us, the medium is the message.”</p></div>"
101,spring,2002,s2002,wink,"Wynn Smith's Wink line has always evoked a very specific subsection of American youth—well-bred girls who, for one reason or another, have gone bad (or at least want to dress that way).</p><p>Next Spring, Smith's followers will stomp about in great-looking confetti-print crepe de chine dresses; instead of conventional suits, they will wear street-ready shrunken pinstripe blazers and long denim skirts with matching patchwork insets. Also likely to show up on hipper college campuses across the country are Smith's bias-tucked shirts, baggy linen jeans and khaki belted trenches. It's unlikely, on the other hand, that his shapeless, gauzy smocks or baggy bikini bottoms will find many takers.</p><p>Smith has consistently displayed an ability to push buttons with his confident aesthetic and irreverent sense of humor—an early collection played out as a homage to Patty Hearst, while another was titled ""No Free Love Hippie Shit Here."" Alas, this time around, the show's self-consciously grungy styling (sundress open to the navel, anyone?) and aggressive soundtrack proved more jarring than intriguing.</p></div>"
102,spring,2002,s2002,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto's cult status derives from his blending of contemporary Western tailoring with elements of traditional Japanese dress—a combination that was brilliantly explored in his collaboration with Adidas for Fall 2001.</p><p>For Spring, Yamamoto returned to some of last season's sports-inspired themes. Athletic bodysuits were worn under lightweight wrap skirts held up with thin shoulder straps; cropped, shiny zip-up blousons gave flowing gowns a streetwise appeal. Yamamoto deconstructed masculine suits by hacking off their sleeves and cinching jackets with decorative bands, or removing their back panels and replacing them with long braids of shredded fabric. Less severe were the floral-printed pantaloons, draped dresses and flowing skirts with pockets concealed in the waistband.</p><p>Yamamoto's partnership with Adidas is proving to be an extremely fruitful one. Sneaker collectors will not want to miss out on the fabulous three-stripe high-tops and scalloped-edge trainers.</p></div>"
1,fall,2002,f2002,a-f-vandevorst,"A.F. Vandevorst invited a thousand guests to a derelict cellar and jammed them together body-to-body on hard wooden benches. Then, after nearly an hour, they turned on strobes so violent people were screaming for mercy. Having successfully driven the audience to the brink of epileptic convulsion, the designers began their show. Ah, Paris! So edgy, it hurts.</p><p>Miraculously, even the application of this Belgian-style torture wasn't enough to ruin what turned out to be a good collection, once the lights were turned on. An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, a pleasant couple from Antwerp, have a distinctive way of juxtaposing formal clothes with athletic pieces and graphic knitwear. Sometimes they put things on back to front, like the excellently cut men's formal tailcoats, or silk dresses. Their yellow and black stripy and zigzag sweater dresses, tights and enormous scarves looked strong interspersed with nylon bombers and ski gilets. The eveningwear has a cool, all-black drama created by layering on sequins and fringe and finishing the look with leggings and slick over-the-knee boots.</p><p>After the show, An Vandevorst said she and her husband were inspired by honey bees. But, please, it's going too far to sting a supportive audience with all that pain.</p></div>"
2,fall,2002,f2002,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti has built her reputation on thinking pretty. Her favorite ways of expressing that are in fragile chiffon party dresses and sweetly-cut princess coats. For fall she does both, but with a hint of the Austro-Hungarian influence that has emerged as one of Milan's propositions for translating spring's folklore feeling into fall clothes.</p><p>The Austrian touches turn up in Ferretti's use of loden and brown and in details like the Tyrolean bindings on her signature coats, military frogging decorating the sleeve of a blazer or felt cutouts adorning a duffel. There are precisely-cut peacoats, pants with raised seams and Aran knits which give Ferretti's girl an ample daytime wardrobe. Come nighttime though, she's back to her fairy chiffons which this season are subjected to endless variations of asymmetric cutting with pleats, raw-edged garlands of petals, twisted shoulder straps, ribbon ties and inserts of three-dimensional flower decorations, mostly in black.</p></div>"
3,fall,2002,f2002,alessandro-dell-acqua,"""It's always images of Helmut Newton from the '70s that inspire me,"" says Alessandro Dell'Acqua. ""That sense of femininity, sensuality and strength.""</p><p>In Dell'Acqua's fall collection, that strand of design, abstracted from the tradition of Saint Laurent, turned rock'n'roll in a Milanese kind of way. His loopy black carpet-knit jackets recalled Saint Laurent's seminal 1940s collection, but were also cousins of this season&amp;'s knits at Balenciaga and Helmut Lang. Dell'Acqua's personal signatures, meanwhile—chiffon dresses and delicate underwear—showed through in handkerchief-point crinkled shifts, sheer ivory pieces scattered with silver sequins, and the lace-edged satin lingerie peeping out amongst the knits. He also merged classic tuxedo dressing with sport elements, transposing the satin ribbon of a ""smoking"" trouser onto cashmere sweat pants. The collection was at its hippest in its simpler moments, though, where Dell'Acqua applied his tailoring skills to neat shrunken jackets, A-line skirts and flares in navy blue cotton.</p></div>"
4,fall,2002,f2002,alexander-mcqueen,"Casting away all but one of his usual theatrical props, Alexander McQueen proved to Paris that his design can stand on its own dramatically erotic strengths. Showing in the shadowy medieval vaulted hall of the Conciergerie, McQueen couldn’t resist a lone, macabre trick—a vista of a pack of caged wolves, and the opening image of a lone figure clad in a purple leather cape leading a pair of dogs (who looked more scared than scary). But that was just for old times’ sake. When his models stalked out in brown tweed, tailored to within an inch of their lives, and strapped into variations on brown leather braces, it was clear McQueen was concentrating on clothes and not theatrics.</p><p>His vixenish women had tiny-waisted silhouettes done with amazing attention to cut and detail. Milkmaid necklines—far from innocent-were pushed up by leather bodices that curved down into the tightest pencil skirts, and finished off with thigh-high leather boots. McQueen moved from that Helmut Newton-esque fantasy to another—bad schoolgirls, who mixed lingerie and silver lamé ties and skirts in with their proper blazers and duffels. For a splendid finale, he brought out romantic flouncy skirts, an exaggerated puff sleeved black velvet coat and a skirt made of swags of jet beading. Best of all, he's softened his sometimes severe hand so that the idea of wearing these pieces seems not just possible, but quite appealing.</p><p>A trim McQueen took his bow in a bespoke suit made by the Savile Row tailors, Huntsman. It seemed like a coming of age. “I wanted it to be romantic, beautiful,” he said. “Power to the women! I got fit for this and I worked hard for it.”</p></div>"
5,fall,2002,f2002,alexandre-herchcovitch,"Brazilian-born Alexandre Herchcovitch followed up his strong Spring show with a walk on the conceptual side for Fall. The predominant silhouette was the voluminous skirt, puffed up with tulle petticoats and possibly inspired by Christian Dior's classic post-war ""New Look."" While Dior's aim was to create attenuated ""femme fleurs,"" Herchcovitch, in contrast, looks to deconstruct traditional conceptions of beauty. He speckled or covered his models' faces with varying degrees of black paint, hung photographs on chains around their necks and substituted sneakers for stilettos.</p><p>The step-riddled set was effective for showing the beauty of color and volume in motion (models flashed their fluorescent knee braces climbing up and down), but the self-conscious presentation often overwhelmed the viable sportswear separates slipped in among the more inflated looks. Most notable were the cargo pants, which the designer made his own with the successful addition of quilting and lingerie button detailing, and the well-tailored jackets and denim pieces that were the true stars of Herchcovitch's show-cum-installation.</p></div>"
6,fall,2002,f2002,alexandre-matthieu,"One day, you're just another pair of starving Paris designers with a miniscule business and no name recognition. The next day, Björk—the one-woman Medici of avant-garde fashion—wears your dress to the Cannes Film Festival and presto! Retailers are beating a path to your garret.</p><p>That's essentially what happened to Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau, the design duo known as Alexandre Matthieu. And while they're not exactly taking business away from Ralph Lauren—this was only their fourth formal show—the duo is establishing an idiosyncratic, artsy look in the vein of Dries Van Noten and Jean Paul Gaultier.</p><p>Fluttery silks and chiffons, some printed with what looked like Icelandic runes, were anchored by tailored pants or long coats. Green leather pieces were inset with white leaves. Of course, there was black, including a great-looking sheer sweater constructed from diagonal bands, but Alexandre Matthieu also brought in a welcome draft of color, including russet, lemon and lavender. Those retailers should drop Björk a thank-you note.</p></div>"
7,fall,2002,f2002,alice-roi,"A search for security? A return to a safer time? A meeting at the Junior League? Alice Roi's Fall collection suggested all of these things and more.</p><p>Roi's inspiration was ""the days of the debutantes""—although she clearly wasn't thinking about gin-swilling Jazz Age nymphets; hers are a more sedate group who wear Ferragamo flats and buy investment clothes. Even when showing edgier ideas, Roi has always been a strong tailor, and this collection's simple lines showed off her skill. Palazzo pants hung perfectly off the models' hips, an ankle-length ivory velvet coat had just the right flare and a wool jersey dress skimmed the body without a hitch.</p><p>The clothes did occasionally get a little too serious. A straightforward red cashmere knit dress would need to be worn with a lot of attitude—or by someone under 25—to avoid coming off as starchy, and some of the velvet pieces sat rather heavily. Roi's wit shone through, though, in the fuzzy ivory fisherman's knits: a shrunken hoody cardigan with poet sleeves, a halter dress, a sleeveless top. And the glitzy red-and-gold brocade pants worn with a skintight ivory top and red cashmere tank? Just the thing to bring out the bad girl trapped inside every well-behaved deb.</p></div>"
8,fall,2002,f2002,ann-demeulemeester,"Ann Demeulemeester has carved out a separate space in the international design landscape, and populated it with a tribe of her own cool people—men and women who look like proud survivors of the apocalypse. It's a dark vision, but goth is too crude a label to slap on Demeulemeester. Her supple, patinated leathers and drapey layers of luxurious fabrics bound with multiple thick belts have a subtle elegance that transcends lumpen adolescent angst.</p><p>Like other designers this season, Demeulemeester thought about combat pants, but hers were done in velvet or soft fabric shot with Lurex and tucked into tough, high leather boots wrapped with thongs. Her vests, jackets and floorsweeping coats sprouted savage edges of long-haired shearling on the shoulder or about the neck, like hunting trophies.</p><p>If the impression Demeuelemeester's design gives is of a group of cave-dwellers, they're a sophisticated bunch with a taste for the trappings of civilization. At night, they wear delicate ivory sequin-scattered dresses, or make an entrance to a clan gathering in a sheer dress with a hood pulled mysteriously over the face. These may be troubled times, Demeulemeester seems to be saying, but that's no excuse to skimp on style.</p></div>"
9,fall,2002,f2002,anna-sui,"Well before fashion's current love of groupie chic and punk revival took hold, rock 'n' roll was Anna Sui's chief source of inspiration. Each Sui collection reveals what's been in her CD player, and for Fall she clearly had Cream, T. Rex and Sergeant Pepper–era Beatles in heavy rotation. The result was a groovy, hippie show that wouldn't have been out of place at Woodstock—although it looked just fine on Naomi Campbell, Carolyn Murphy and all the other top models who regularly walk Sui's show.</p><p>On the bill were chiffon baby-doll tops with vivid Indian prints, appliquéd denim skirts, studded boot-cut cords, open-work crocheted tops and dresses, and wool separates embroidered with folky cross-stitch. Sui worked mostly in dark hues, with occasional forays into historically appropriate colors like purple, olive green and peacock blue. Greatest hits included a series of pretty, sheer floral-print dresses and two great embroidered Mongolian lamb-trimmed coats that screamed ""light my fire.""</p><p>Worn head-to-toe, this collection could be too trippy-hippie for the average customer. But a few pieces from Sui's '60s anthology could retune any wardrobe.</p></div>"
10,fall,2002,f2002,anne-klein,"Anne Klein, who died in 1974, was a forceful proponent of smart, fashionable, well-made clothes for working women (a philosophy she passed on to her former design assistant Donna Karan). But the past few years have seen several changes in direction for the company she founded, which has lost ground as a result.</p><p>Now, with new ownership and a new design director, Charles Nolan, the house is hoping to reclaim its rightful place in executive wardrobes. Nolan came to Anne Klein from Ellen Tracy, another bastion of career clothes, so he knows what works in a boardroom and what doesn't. No micro-minis, no sheer tops; instead, he offered a solid series of items like A-line leather skirts, short shearling jackets, crisply creased trousers and tweed three-quarter coats. Styles were fitted, but never supertight, and the color palette stuck close to tones of mocha, cream, white, black and navy.</p><p>Busy women like to look good, of course, but Nolan knows they also like to save time; to cut down on agonizing decision-making, he showed all his looks, even a slinky white jersey evening dress with black stiletto snakeskin boots.</p></div>"
11,fall,2002,f2002,antonio-berardi,"Antonio Berardi is a young designer with a British-Italian background and Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design credentials. After briefly showing as a recent graduate in the late Nineties, he vanished from the London fashion scene only to reappear in Milan. No wonder the Italians embraced his hybrid sensibility: he loves girls in eveningwear dressed to the max and never holds back.</p><p>Berardi's southern Italian roots show in his affinity for decoration, and his London upbringing in his taste for tougher, punk-influenced styling. For Fall 2002, he used patterned leather made to look like fabric, in swing-skirted dresses with corseted torsos emphasized with multiple studded belts. Berardi revved up white tailoring and black jersey with bondage straps bristling with silver hardware, and wasn't afraid to send out a pant suit in bubble-gum pink lace and leather. With his asymmetric chiffon dresses and loudly patterned lace-and-bead-encrusted boots, the designer's bravado performance was very much in the vein of John Galliano's work at Dior. For next season, he has signed a deal with Gibo which offers him the chance to develop a more personal signature.</p></div>"
12,fall,2002,f2002,as-four,"No New York fashion week is complete without at least one event that features some combination of the following: a much-hyped young talent; a mob scene at the door, complete with screaming security guards; a chaotic presentation; and, oh yes, some legitimate talent. This season, that event came courtesy of As Four, the avant-garde design collective that made its name with the ubiquitous, influential circle handbag a few seasons ago.</p><p>Scheduled for 9 p.m. at the Cooper Union theater, the show didn’t actually get underway until close to 10:30. That left ample time for the crowd to sneak cigarettes and drink the copious amounts of wine that had been supplied by the group’s sponsor, Italian company Ecco Domani.</p><p>And the collection itself? Well, there were some pretty clothes hidden underneath the perversely cut lamé outfits and string-sculpture tops, and the soft flower hats worn by some of the models were gorgeous. But however talented they are as designers, the group proved equally adept at using pretentious staging, difficult lighting and an off-putting soundtrack to obscure the fruits of their labors. If only the fashion could have flowed as freely as the wine.</p></div>"
13,fall,2002,f2002,badgley-mischka,"Into each life a little eveningwear must fall. The problem is that too often, formal dress fits into one of three categories: boring black, prom-queen redux or dowager-dowdy. Design duo Badgley Mischka are none of the above. They've built a nice business—and a hefty celebrity following—making elegant formal clothes that satisfy the demands of the Park Avenue charity circuit as well as Hollywood's red-carpet gauntlet.</p><p>For Fall, Badgley Mischka did it again. In another of the small showroom shows so popular this season, they presented 44 options for evening, from simple (a black georgette dress ornamented with ribbons and black beads) to super-siren (a scarlet gown with a lace-lined plunging neckline). In a niche used to a piling on of glitz, they mostly showed admirable restraint, relying on body-hugging cuts, sheer fabrics and a few well-placed ruffles to communicate sex appeal. Hip girls will like the ivory and black-lace tiered cocktail dress; hip moms will dig a snappy little ivory ribbon cocktail suit. Halle Berry will snag the ivory velvet gown with red beading.</p></div>"
14,fall,2002,f2002,balenciaga,"The 26 looks that Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquière showed here today at the Gagosian Gallery will be more scrutinized than Enron’s balance sheet. That’s because Ghesquière has become one of fashion’s magnate designers, able to change the look of a season with one outfit. Moving his fall show to New York from Paris added a significant jolt to fashion week, increased by the fact that getting one of the 200 tickets was well-nigh impossible.</p><p>But well worth the effort. In front of an audience that included both fashion maven Sarah Jessica Parker and Domenico de Sole, president and CEO of Balenciaga parent Gucci Group, Ghesquière breezed confidently through a collection that was inventive, original—and commercially viable. The all-black opening was tough-girl chic: variations on the motorcycle jacket, with exaggerated knit collars and worn with skintight pants or tight, flippy skirts. He showed soft, oversized sweaters and jackets, and a small group of colorful knee-length collage dresses apparently influenced by Cubist paintings. Ghesquière helped usher in fashion’s current love of artisan craft, and the dramatic, shaggy ivory coats that closed the show could double as soft sculpture.</p><p>While some designers struggle to express one theme per season, Ghesquière’s dilemma seems to be how to control his bountiful creative flow.</p></div>"
15,fall,2002,f2002,bcbg-max-azria,"Max Azria, the founder and designer of BCBG, is a man who generally keeps a finger firmly on the fashion pulse. The company has been turning out smart takes on sophisticated trends for more than a decade, making loyal customers out of women who love fashion but whose budgets don't stretch to big-ticket designers.</p><p>For his Fall collection, Azria seemed to be tuned more to a jungle beat than a style channel. With a few exceptions, every look consisted of layered, crinkled gauze or chiffon dresses, done in tones of brown, black or olive and weighted down with chains or studded leather belts. Asymmetrical hems and necklines were the order of the day, and there was enough shredding on the runway to pique the interest of the SEC.</p><p>Highlights included a black wool three-quarter coat with fur trim, some well-cut pinstripe jackets and trousers, and a suede studded skirt. And knowing how much women love options, Azria created a great boot: With parallel zippers at two heights, it goes from ankle- to knee-high in an instant.</p></div>"
16,fall,2002,f2002,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour's Fall show—her first on a runway—could literally be described as poetic. Having immersed herself in Byron, Herman Melville, A. E. Housman and Emily Dickinson for inspiration, the designer embroidered lines from each of these poets in gold thread on several of her pieces.</p><p>Sarafpour used fabrics that ranged from rich velvets to crisp cotton canvas to light-as-air georgette, and divided her show into daytime and evening looks. Unlike many designers who think their customers undergo a personality change when the sun goes down, Sarafpour's woman starts and ends her day with a sense of easy romance. The varied palette included black, navy, white, pink, plum, gray and lilac, and the silhouette was long but not skintight; Sarafpour's georgette evening dresses skimmed the body like slips. Strong tailoring was also in evidence, exemplified by a snappy blue alpaca trench worn over a black georgette blouse and low-slung velvet pants. Sweet bits of girlishness were added to several looks with streaming ribbons, subtle metal fringe or the odd floral patchwork pocket.</p><p>In short, this beautifully edited show (14 looks in all) was brief as a haiku and light as an Elizabethan sonnet.</p></div>"
17,fall,2002,f2002,benjamin-cho,"Benjamin Cho knows how to edit: His short, quiet show, held in the Japan Society’s auditorium, contained a mere 16 looks. The collection was sponsored by Shiseido, which has been backing promising new designers as a way to get their message into the mainstream.</p><p>Cho is possessed of both technical skills and a sense of humor—a happy combination. His first look was a lightweight black knife-pleated jacket worn over skinny black pants whose white lacings started at a pair of Converse high-tops and ran all the way up the leg. This was followed by a lovely black jacket with a graceful cascading ruffle at the waist. The designer’s side-lacing pieces had some S&amp;M charm, and there were clever dresses with circular inserts of gathered contrasting fabric, as well as pretty ruched tops. But ruching and lacing aren’t exactly new ideas, and—even with severe editing—the looks got repetitive.</p></div>"
18,fall,2002,f2002,bernhard-willhelm,"As a recording of the day's news from a German TV station played in the background, Bernhard Willhelm's show gave viewers a strange sensation something akin to watching a child psychology session in progress. Willhelm's subjects have reached the brink of adolescence, don't know whether to retreat into the safety of childhood or confront the scary outside world, and look like they might have made their clothes in an art-therapy group.</p><p>The healing began with girls walking out in dresses and skirts made from what looked like dinosaur-appliqued nursery curtains or bedspreads, their faces daubed with face-paint. For the next stage of treatment, the kids had been encouraged to do all sorts of things with sweatshirts and shell suits—like embroidering them with AC/DC slogans, trees, angels and dog-skeletons, and somehow throwing in their mothers' Hermès scarf print symbols. (They had also decided to sport their pencils, paintbrushes and rulers around their necks as jewelry.) At mealtime, they were out to lunch in a Ronald McDonald-meets-the-Simpsons clownish world of brash polka dots and harlequin patterns.</p><p>It's easy to laugh, but Bernhard Willhelm touches a nerve. He's a designer acutely sensitized to the weirdness and stress of being young in the contemporary world and many fashion followers of his generation understand exactly what he's saying.</p></div>"
19,fall,2002,f2002,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson has the three things that most designers struggle for their entire lives: a signature look, a solid business and a legion of devoted customers. All of which allows her to kick back at her fashion shows and concentrate on entertaining the troops—and herself. This season, the show was in her workroom, the theme was ""Sisters"" and the cutting table was her runway.</p><p>Johnson had 22 of her staff members model the collection; you'll be shocked to discover that she hires a lot of extroverts. Everyone from Jill in PR to Marcy the receptionist to Rebecca the patternmaker worked the runway like pros, shimmying to a bluesy soundtrack and eliciting big smiles from the audience—not to mention wolf whistles from the photographers. The clothes helped. There were clingy bias-cut satin ombré dresses, shirred chiffons, flapper-fringe skirts, sheer crocheted tops and an occasional pair of army-green knickers. The palette was relatively subdued; this season, Johnson's big on blues, pinks, peaches, brown and bronze, and fabrics like chiffon, charmeuse and matte jersey.</p><p>Johnson's clothes are overtly sexy, with plenty of boudoir influences—eyelet, lingerie ribbons, cleavage-enhancing lace and so forth—but always with a good-time Mae West spirit. Her sister act, while not for everyone, can be hard to resist.</p></div>"
20,fall,2002,f2002,bill-blass,"With two well-received collections behind him, Bill Blass designer Lars Nilsson is still being scrutinized by the arbiters of style. After all, the fashion industry is full of one-season wonders. And Mr. Blass, although retired, is still very much a name that matters to his devoted clients (who eagerly await his biography, due out next month).</p><p>Part of the liveliness that Nilsson has injected into the Blass label comes from his delight in color and pattern. For Fall, he was inspired in large part by the traditional textiles and handcrafts of the Amish and his native Sweden, which he worked into the Blass tradition of well-tailored sportswear. Nilsson took a leaf pattern and turned it into a colorful, oversize print for silk satin, and showed a sweeping, fur-trimmed white coat with a ladder of black stripes. There were shapely wool suits, a luxuriously cozy embroidered cashmere anorak and, for evening, a series of lovely dresses, including a rainbow-hued, hand-tinted velvet number.</p><p>Though Nilsson leaned a little too heavily on his traditional sources this time around, he continues to bring a new spirit—and a new sense of buzz—to the hallowed house of Blass.</p></div>"
21,fall,2002,f2002,blaak,"The search for escape routes out of the ""peasant"" and ""tribal"" themes of Spring—without abandoning the color and energy they brought to the scene—is becoming part of the saga of this season's collections. When Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif of Blaak took their own particular streetwise diversion off the nomad path, they ended up with a hit.</p><p>Adding a tougher edge to hippie eclecticism, Blaak put zippy bomber jackets in overdyed furnishing fabric over layered lace-edged skirts, and used shots of bright orange, turquoise and purple against military greens. And while Mexican references could be seen in a great stripy shoulder bag and the knitted shawls wound around some outfits, the real success of the collection was that it didn't look like a bunch of travelers' souvenirs. That's thanks to the rumpled treatment of washed and worn-in cotton drill and silk, the offhand sexiness of the drapey jersey tanks knotted at the shoulders, and the fact that the models swaggered in their hip-slung skirts and pants in elongated Robert Clergerie flats. No '60s hippie ever dressed like that, nor had that attitude—which is exactly what made this collection look so fresh.</p></div>"
22,fall,2002,f2002,hugo-boss,"Since its days costuming those suave, slick guys on <em>Miami Vice</em>, Hugo Boss has specialized in making traditional corporate wear look sexy. The company has gone through several evolutions since then, including adding women's wear to its repertoire, but its Fall collection showed it can still dress the new power generation.</p><p>Using body-hugging lines and stretch fabrics that look by turns crisp and fluid, Boss managed to give traditional silhouettes an appealing twist. After starting out with an all-white group (head-to-toe monochrome dressing has emerged as a major trend this season) Boss added all-black and then tones of plum, brown and smoky gray. Jackets were cut close to the body and stopped at the hip or at the top of the leg, and worn over slim or even skintight pants. Bias-cut skirts were paired with gauzy knits or turtlenecks, while lightweight, long-sleeve dresses got a touch of femininity with pin-tucking and scooping necklines.</p><p>While the fashion ideas presented weren't exactly new kids on the block, the Boss collection reflects its ultimate customer: confident and irreproachably pulled together.</p></div>"
23,fall,2002,f2002,boudicca,"The Boudicca experience is an intense one. For designers Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby, fashion goes far beyond the simple enjoyment of things to wear, and into the realms of symbolism, psychology and politics.</p><p>This show was a walk on the dark side—literally. Models walked in somber steps, following a spotlight that was dragged overhead to illuminate their way in a blacked-out studio. But if the sinister portent hanging over this collection was unavoidable, it never overshadowed the level of refinement Boudicca's work has reached. Unlike many less experienced London designers, Broach and Kirkby have a rigorous way of cutting and tailoring that produces precisely pressed and folded graphic shapes that could not have come from any other hands. A Boudicca piece—whether an asymmetric satin skirt, a kimono dress with a caped top or a dinner jacket with the lapels fused into the jacket and the tail lopped off square—is recognizable by its formality, dignity and presence.</p><p>Though these compelling qualities have spellbound many fashion insiders, outside support has been hard to come by—maybe because the label is impossible to pigeonhole by trend or category. Barneys New York is one of the few stores to carry Boudicca pieces, as was the London boutique Yasmin Cho, which has recently gone out of business. Such blows are capable of knocking small designers off-course, but by the look of this collection, Boudicca is determined to keep on following its own uncompromising path.</p></div>"
24,fall,2002,f2002,bruce,"Bruce sailed into Fall with a nautical-themed show that deftly displayed the draping and construction talents of designers Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli. This Shiseido-sponsored collection, the team's tenth, featured 15 looks that each emphasized what Gutierrez described as ""the freedom and lightness of the fabric.""</p><p>Bruce's theme was evoked with details like cording, ""sail"" belts and knot-like draping. Sex appeal was in ample supply thanks to pieces like the fine net top worn, with a black tank dress, by Caroline Ribeiro. Highlights included the black pocket pants modeled by Delfine—a trimmer, refined take on slouchy hip-hop trousers. The pairing of floaty draped pieces with more substantial, almost sporty separates such as tab jeans and a car coat kept things on an even keel, with only the voluminous, multi-cowl blouses ever threatening the balance. Jody Busby's single earrings—dangling chunks of stone wrapped with thread-thin wire—added some sparkle to the somberly colored clothes, which were all rendered in a muted palette of black, smoke, taupe and teal.</p><p>This was a collection for confident sophisticates, exuding an ease and fluidity that have been finely honed over the last few seasons.</p></div>"
25,fall,2002,f2002,burberry-prorsum,"Burberry's chief designer is Christopher Bailey, a 30-year-old Brit with an international pedigree that includes a long stint under Tom Ford at Gucci and before that a stop at Donna Karan. That experience has primed him as a brand-conscious team leader, who has already focused the disparate aspects of the Burberry London collection, rethought the house plaid and bumped up the accessories.</p><p>It's a different challenge, though, to forge a vision for the Burberry Prorsum label—the ""designer"" collection of a house whose reputation was built on a classic raincoat. For his first official show, Bailey took a younger approach than his predecessor, Roberto Menichetti, showing double-breasted coats in modernized slubby tweeds and using a paisley motif that was printed on wool shirts and embroidered or embossed as a pattern on coats and jackets. Bailey also transposed the anatomy of a Burberry mac—the belts, buckles, hooks, epaulettes and storm flaps—into punky straps and hardware on low-slung skirts, culottes and pants. Though it wasn't enough to trigger a second wave of Burberry fever, the designer did devise a treat for accessory lovers; his huge leather and tweed bags hanging from thick straps looked great.</p></div>"
26,fall,2002,f2002,cacharel,"Cacharel is the perky mademoiselle of French fashion, with roots in the Seventies ready-to-wear revolution that made snappy style affordable and available for the fillies in the street. Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro, enthusiastic believers in upholding Cacharel's value-for-money tradition, are happy to play with the pretty prints and neat separates that made the house's reputation.</p><p>For fall, they called on Celia Birtwell, the printmaker who worked with (and was married to) designer Ossie Clark in the Seventies, to create some designs for Cacharel. And from her front-row seat at the show, Birtwell watched her handiwork go by: hand-drawn leaves, flowers and cameo doodles ornamented high-waisted Ossie-like fluted dresses, silky skirts, trenches and blouses. Those were interspersed with jeans, glazed cotton bombers and little sixties-style velvet double-breasted suits trimmed with denim. Afterward, Birtwell said she thought the prints ""looked rather good."" Clements, for her part, said working in an Ossie Clark aesthetic was a dream come true. ""When I was seven, I saw Ossie in Camden market and asked him for a job,"" she said. ""He was wearing a yellow cape covered in bells and carrying a King Charles spaniel. If I'd been old enough, I'd have been a total Ossie girl.""</p></div>"
27,fall,2002,f2002,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein is one of the great zeitgeist readers of our time. His collections, like his famous ad campaigns, always reflect and amplify some aspect of the national mood, but filtered through his cool, minimalist aesthetic. And in his beautiful Fall show, Klein mirrored a sober but still sensuous attitude toward life during wartime.</p><p>Klein's first group was, like many this week, all black, starting with a fitted coat whose seams were traced in leather and followed by sweeping dresses, pleated skirts and tops done in flowing fabrics. He then introduced tones of brown, gray and navy, and worked in military references, like a taupe Eisenhower jacket and a few officer's greatcoats recut with the new, higher waistline. But while Klein's smart menswear tailoring touches were present throughout—pants cut slim but not skintight, jackets that sat just above the waist—the net effect was always feminine, helped by sexily transparent knits, floaty georgette tops and a fit that lightly grazed the body.</p><p>Klein's eveningwear is always noteworthy for its inventive cut and restrained romance, and he didn't disappoint this season. He sent out a gorgeous series of dresses assembled from diamond-shaped pieces of satin that will make even the most determined nesters long for a black-tie evening.</p></div>"
28,fall,2002,f2002,carolina-herrera,"For Fall 2002, Carolina Herrera did what jazz musicians do all the time: Take a standard and breathe new life into it. In her own riff on a series of classics, Herrera turned out a luxurious, perfectly balanced show that could easily have been titled ""Lush Life.""</p><p>Herrera's concise collection, shown to a small audience in her showroom, was built around menswear fabrics and tailoring, reworked to very feminine proportions and in a restrained palette of black, ivory, gold and gray. Crisply tailored, wide-leg pants showed up either as part of a suit—the jackets with a hint of built-up shoulder, the button-front vests worn as a top—or with sexy, silky shirts. There were glimpses of well-bred glitz throughout. A restrained gold-lamé fabric, for instance, was made day-wearable in a narrow coat or the aforementioned trousers, while some of the jackets got a whirl of gold beading on the shoulders. Plush leopard-stenciled lamb showed up in a simple belted coat, and as a jacket over a satin skirt.</p><p>For evening, Herrera sent out a series of slinky black dresses, each set off by one eye-catching detail: a flash of red lining, a cascade of ruffles or a deep plunge neckline.</p></div>"
29,fall,2002,f2002,catherine-malandrino,"After presenting her Spring collection at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, Malandrino migrated downtown to a raw space in the meat-packing district next to the infamous Hogs &amp; Heifers bar—an appropriate location for her Western-themed Fall collection, titled ""Wanted.""</p><p>The show certainly did not want for theatricality. The models made their exits with deeply smudged eyes and masses of tumbleweed hair in a variety of blouses that were shirred, tucked, embroidered, smocked and otherwise embellished. These were paired with equally elaborate trousers, the most notable of which was the signature Wanted pant: low-waisted, ruched, laced and so wide-bottomed at the foot that they swept the floor. The leather appliqué pants were strong, as were some of the coats.</p><p>Some of the looks presented (including the aforementioned pants) were from Malandrino's new limited-edition series, which she hopes customers will collect as if they were works of art. At times, though, the show was in need of less art and more reality. As much as the designer sought ""the feeling of getting lost in a wild plain,"" there were moments when it seemed as if she had ended up on the set of <em>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</em> instead.</p></div>"
30,fall,2002,f2002,celine,"Michael Kors opened his Celine show with Caroline Ribeiro walking out in a long camel coat, black silk shirt with a matching fringed silk scarf, and a pair of what he calls ""flight pants."" It signaled the mood of a collection that was about well-cut, understandable sportswear with an international spin aimed at women with a taste for modern classics.</p><p>The warm, rugged WWII flying jacket has functioned as an iconic taking-off point for many designers this season. Kors refined it into a beautiful sandblasted shearling patchwork coat and a series of variations on the bomber jacket, and extrapolated the antique leather look into skirts and almost luggage-sized hand-held totes. He also transposed elements of the classic pilot's jumpsuit—zippered pockets, military cottons—into casual pants and skirts in a soft gray waxed nylon and later into citified broadcloth.</p><p>But this was no history-of-aviation theme show. Instead, Kors concentrated on workable wardrobe options like luxe wool denim jeans with a tapering flare, turtlenecks, belted leather jackets and slim ankle-length cardigan coats in cashmere knit. But while fur shrugs and a huge wine-colored fox worn by Carmen Kass added a special touch, something was missing from this well-behaved presentation. Michael Kors is one of the wittiest characters in the fashion universe, and Paris mourns the sense of humor he's applied in happier seasons.</p></div>"
31,fall,2002,f2002,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan likes to set an intelligence test for his audience. When a lone Asian model walked on stage dressed in what was clearly a genuine ethnic costume, then stood stock-still for fifteen long minutes, there was restlessness and discomfort in the crowd. Was this some sort of silent protest? Was that a tear trickling down the poor girl’s face?</p><p>When she was joined by several other models whose costumes were increasingly overlaid by black shards of western menswear fabric, the guessing game entered a new round. First, Chalayan segued into black skirt and pantsuits done with his distinctive asymmetric cuts. The free-floating strips of fabric he’s been attaching to clothes since last season recurred, both through the tailoring and hitched to jersey dresses, which were constructed to drape, bunch up and fall in waves at the hemline. Then he turned to cotton sweat-fabric, cut raw-edged as tops over little flouncy skirts and as a plunge-front gray halter dress with a full, swingy hemline—simple but elegantly modern. Moving into brown canvas, he cut short dresses and coats with military pockets and then layered a net web over black jersey dresses.</p><p>After the show, Chalayan revealed that the ethnic costume came from a region of eastern Turkey, but refused any further explanation, saying, “Interpret it as you will.” No matter: neither enigmatic pronouncements nor symbolic gestures could obscure the fact that these were stunning—and quite original—clothes.</p></div>"
32,fall,2002,f2002,chloe,"In her second season as Chloé design head, Phoebe Philo hit a lanky, confident stride. For Fall 2002, she gave sexy vitality to leg-lengthening pants, curvy jackets, chiffon tops and refined Sergeant Pepper style military coats, while never laying the retro/vintage theme on too thick.</p><p>Philo did velvet flares, gray-washed jeans with military buttonhole details, and an easy, slouchy man’s pant. She even cut schoolboy shorts in a low-slung way that avoided any association with cutesy hot pants. And, in the teeth of competition from pretty much every designer around, she turned out the best biker pants in town. Done in worn-looking gray-brown leather and cropped just below the knee, they were shown with the spindliest stiletto-heeled pumps—the killer kicker. For the top half, Philo turned her attention to jackets and coats with something special about them, and brought new energy to Chloé’s long-held reputation for chiffon pieces. Her black military tailcoats and jackets with flowered appliqués and Indian embroideries channeled a boho-60's eclecticism without looking like dusty fleamarket finds. For evening, she added sparkle by running silver bugle beads in strips or streamers from the shoulders of layered chiffon tops and tunics in patterns inspired by Leon Bakst.</p><p>In short: top marks to Philo for staying true to her young Brit-girl instincts, while respecting—and living up to—Parisian standards of design.</p></div>"
33,fall,2002,f2002,christian-dior,"Given John Galliano's track record of whizzing an overload of a trillion colors and cultural references past his bedazzled Dior audience, it hardly seems possible to say he's settling down. But this fall collection is almost classic in its Dior-isms containing all the patterns, symbols and accessories on which Galliano has re-built the house foundations. That means ethnic color and print, love of the eighteenth century, an obsession with bias-cut dresses, a ""sauvage"" method of cutting all his own—and, of course, the constantly updated Dior saddlebags.</p><p>Galliano's girls stormed out in Peruvian knitted hats sprouting huge Mohawks, their feet bound up in fur moccasin-boots. The clothes were sexily recut from a haul of Indian, South American, Mongolian and Tibetan materials. Flouncy skirts edged in gold Indian print sometimes with bells around the hem, Indian mirrored and gold embroidery, Hungarian rose folk prints, lacquered leather paisley and Chinese quilting—they were all there in a breathless melee. Standouts were the ruffled skirts with their gilded edges, and a patchwork inside-out fur with huge shoulders, painted to run from rose red through orange on the outside.</p><p>This season's saddlebag update—fresh accessories being a crucial part of every designer business—is oversized and done in patchwork suede and fur. As a nod to Christian Dior heritage, Galliano threw in some 1940s coats worn with round-toed pumps and woolly knee socks. But we hardly need the ""roots"" reminders these days. Galliano has so thoroughly remade the house in his own image, who cares?</p></div>"
34,fall,2002,f2002,christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix can usually be trusted to whip up a kaleidoscopic color-storm for his ready-to-wear collections, but for fall he held back and delivered a muted collection full of black, bordeaux and bois de rose pink.</p><p>Judging from the German cabaret music on the soundtrack, the designer's focus seems to have shifted from the sunny south to the faded decadence of northern Europe. Always a romantic though, Lacroix cut a recurring silhouette with a full skirt and a tiny jacket—whether a bolero or biker style—on top. He showed his taste for complex textures, embellishment and print in a slew of lace, devore velvet, ruching and patchwork, all done with an antiqued, slightly distressed look.</p><p>The best moments of the collection were the delicate pinks, the pretty sparkling tulle fairy dresses and the canvas arts-and-crafts painting and embroidery on the outside of a fur-lined coat and jacket.</p></div>"
35,fall,2002,f2002,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro's hand-crafty, sweetly eccentric collections have been one of the highlights of the London shows since the mid-90's. But the stakes have now been raised for the young duo, who are showing their own collection in Paris, as well as having taken the creative reins at Cacharel. Like all independent designers they face, not just the pressure to stun people with their originality, but the toughest financial climate in years to boot.</p><p>It was a shame, then, to see this show fall several notches short of the creativity benchmark set by Paris thus far. Clements Ribeiro said they'd been inspired by <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, which meant they'd followed the folkloric path already trodden by hordes of designers this season. They did picture-book flower appliqués sewn on to sweats, track tops, coats and skirts with blanket stitching. They got into pleating in a big way, in print skirts and plisse tops, and worked a new form of appliqué by cutting out raw-edged satin flowers and hand-sewing them to georgette. A small flash of their pioneering talent showed itself in cashmere knits with a version of their signature stripes done in bands of folky pattern. Shoes and boots featuring cut-out leaves of metallic leather were eyecatchingly sexy. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to suppress the feeling that Paris expects more of them than this.</p></div>"
36,fall,2002,f2002,comme-des-garcons,"You wouldn't normally associate Comme des Garçons with chic chignons—let alone the sound of Sinatra crooning ""let's face the music and dance."" But those were the classic elements in the background of a show that designer Rei Kawakubo described as ""free knitting."" Almost completely black, save for a couple of things in gray and a tint of blue, the collection was partly about Kawakubo revisiting her own past. Mostly, though, it was an intense research project into what can be done with different varieties of wool, knitting needles and an unconventional vision.</p><p>Kawakubo began by wrapping twisted cardigan-coats around the body so that pockets were displaced at odd angles and tan-yellow buttons spiraled the torso. The color blackout, and the consistent styling device of leggings-with-everything, gave Kawakubo artistic license to go crazy, experimenting with a vast range of shapes and stitches. Knit sweatshirting, bouclé and the season's loopy textured sweaters all turned up in a beautifully elegant, off-kilter way.</p><p>It was a long show. A lull could be felt, giving the audience time to ponder the poignant significance of Old Blue Eyes' lyrics (""there may be teardrops ahead""), but it was followed by a flurry of scribbling when a twisted, tufty raven's wing-colored fake fur coat and a leather-fronted double-breasted cardigan swung by. Life may be hard—but who cares when the fashion adrenaline's running high?</p></div>"
37,fall,2002,f2002,costume-national,"Like many designers, Ennio Capasa of Costume National went dark for Fall showing a collection that was mostly black, lit here and there by some winter white ensembles and touches of gold. As somber as the palette was, these were clothes not for goths, but for well-bred girls who like to think of themselves as ""bad."" Costume's hooded coat, leather bombers and cigarette-slim pants conjured nothing so much as a twenty-first century Sandra Dee.</p><p>Capasa was on-trend with his furiously furry jackets (a major theme of this season), but generally offered individual pieces rather than a fully focused collection. Which is not to say that some of those pieces weren't highly desirable. The smoking pantsuits and the short-as-they come mini dresses cinched with masculine-style leather belts (perfect for cocktails at eight) were strong, and provided an alternative—perhaps an antidote?—to some of the tougher leather looks, which seemed more suitable for an evening of chain-smoking and high-decibel rock.</p></div>"
38,fall,2002,f2002,d-g,"Hello, cowgirl in the sand. Or, in this case, the Alps. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana went north for inspiration for their Fall D&amp;G secondary line and came back with a Tyrolean-themed collection—just the thing for a sexy, young Heidi with a great figure and a good sense of humor.</p><p>Shown against a backdrop that included two plastic cows, a milking stool and a bucket, D&amp;G sent out gossamer peasant blouses, embroidered or eyelet-trimmed and paired with super-low-rise tight jeans, loose cargo pants or pleated micro-minis. Sheer chiffon dresses and blouses were worn over brightly-colored bras—not strictly Alpine, but certainly fun. Those mountain breezes can get chilly, though, so there were plenty of close-fitting Tyrolean jackets and vests, a granny-square stole, and generously cut sweater coats and scarves to keep warm. Should Heidi head into the big city for a date, she could choose a figure-hugging cowl-neck sweater dress or a plaid bustier with wool pants. And given the high proportion of men's looks that came down the runway, D&amp;G clearly has a mate in mind for their modern cowgirl.</p></div>"
39,fall,2002,f2002,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane von Furstenberg's show has become the unofficial opening ceremony of fashion week, where socialites and industry types gather at the designer's headquarters for a high-powered Sunday-night happening. The front row this year included Susan Sarandon chatting with Ellen Barkin and tycoon husband Ron Perelman, Marisa Berenson, Cheryl Tiegs, and Jessica Alba with fiancé Michael Weatherly. Across the room, the Hilton sisters sat next to two of the Miller sisters, in a dazzling display of blonde socialite bonding.</p><p>There was plenty of commotion on the runway as well, as von Furstenberg once again pushed her identity past its wrap-dress roots. DVF's theme was ""Crosstown Traffic,"" an homage to the energy and variety of city living. For uptown girls, there were still those pretty chiffon dresses, but roughed up with graffiti or splatter prints and torn edges. Downtown types, meanwhile, might prefer the wide-leg embroidered pants paired with a gold velour T-shirt or a satin baseball jacket.</p><p>As she travels in a new direction, von Furstenberg is bound to hit some roadblocks, like this season's odd knee-length harem pants or the Obi-sleeve black-and-green closing number. But von Furstenberg has been making smart, sexy clothes for too long to let the occasional pothole slow her down.</p></div>"
40,fall,2002,f2002,dkny,"Donna Karan's secondary DKNY line is where the designer takes a walk on the wilder side. She romps through pop culture, digesting current trends and reworking them into a collection of snappy items. In a blindingly fast-paced show that mixed the women's and men's collections, the designer showed she still has the touch.</p><p>Karan is nothing if not eclectic, and here she managed to mix some seemingly irreconcilable themes. But then, who else could reconcile the urban gypsy (ruched, ruffled or patchwork leather skirts, lace-trimmed tops) with the new prepster (a monogram sweater, a fisherman knit hoody, pinstripe pants)? The subdued palette helped: There were shots of color, but Karan mostly restricted herself to brown, gray, white, navy and ivory. Also helping keep things grounded were staples of the straightforward sportswear that was DKNY's original base: snug pinstripe pants, a great pea coat, even some of the tailored jackets that Karan, a working woman herself, always includes.</p></div>"
41,fall,2002,f2002,dolce-gabbana,"For Fall 2002, Dolce &amp; Gabbana conducted a tour through their fashion heartland, pointing out everything they do best and romancing an idea Stefano Gabbana calls ""rustic glamor.""</p><p>For country lovers of the high-heeled-wearing kind, the design duo suggested sexy cords, beautiful handcrafted suede coats, Peruvian ponchos, chunky fur scarves and any number of fabulous outsize shoulder bags made of fringed wool and woven leather. Dolce &amp; Gabbana's signature masculine-feminine three-piece pantsuits looked classic yet freshly relevant, with their sharp tailoring and flattering vests (an item that's shooting up the Fall fashion charts). They also showed hip-slung bootleg or low-rider baggy cords, lingerie tops and a zillion desirable accessories—rope belts, long fringed scarves, stacks of gold bangles and bracelets and delicious boots and shoes—all corralled from a huge range of countrified textures and fabrics in shades of brown and cream.</p><p>Of course, no peasant maid would ever wear a thigh-high flirty skirt with a streetwise brown corduroy jacket bristling with buckled poacher-pockets. Or pick her way through fields in pale suede boots patterned in nail-head studs. But that's the genius of this label—total devotion to the cause of gorgeousness whatever terrain fashion happens to be passing through at the time.</p></div>"
42,fall,2002,f2002,donna-karan,"Donna Karan's new corporate culture may be French—her company is now part of the French luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH—but her heart belongs to NYC. And her Fall collection, shown to a small audience (including her new boss, LVMH head Bernard Arnault) was a love poem to her hometown. She even named it ""Manhattan Blues.""</p><p>New York can be chilly in the winter, and Karan, who loves dramatic outerwear, provided plenty of coats to choose from. The show started with a gorgeous, glistening calf number, continued through a great napa-leather trench, and closed with a cozy ivory cashmere jacquard. Next to the body, meanwhile, the designer likes a soft, silky layer—hence her series of sexy, body-skimming skirts and dresses. These were constructed from an elegant patchwork of wool and silk jerseys, satin, georgette and velvet, sometimes all in the same dress. And as if to protect her customers from the city's harder edges, Karan showed cozy oversize cashmere knit pieces made for sinking into. Even her suits—there were a few short jackets paired with slim trousers—were cut on the bias to make movement easy, and had a bit of soft fringe hanging off the arm.</p><p>After the soft and sexy feel of her daywear, the unexpected glitz of some of Karan's evening pieces felt out of sync, especially in some of the odd appliqués. Overall, though, this was a collection guaranteed to chase the blues away.</p></div>"
43,fall,2002,f2002,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten visualizes women as a traveling sisterhood who roam the world picking up pieces of local costume as they continue their endless journey from season to season. At a guess, this fall, their long march has taken them to the far reaches of Eastern Europe—or thereabouts. Wherever, it's somewhere chilly, because the diaphanous Asian things they wore in summer have turned to heavy ethnic woolens and layers of garments—say, a jacket over a skirt over bloomers over thick leggings or massive shawls, embroidered in wool with chunky fringes over swinging coats.</p><p>What this creates is an almost pyramidal silhouette that obliterates the body but suggests a kind of ceremonial grandeur. One of Van Noten's signatures is the precious looking highly decorated scarf: this season's versions are embroidered and embellished with sequined patterns, and worn displayed on the front of the body like a religious garment. Elsewhere, the strengths of this collection were in the huge flounced skirts riding low on the hips, and in Van Noten's deft mixing of subtle colors and prints. In short, plenty to please his cult following of cross-cultural fashion nomads.</p></div>"
44,fall,2002,f2002,eley-kishimoto,"Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto represent London's cheerful tendency. Known for their exuberant print work and happily naive post-WW II styling, this husband-and-wife team has a business built on charm.</p><p>Having formerly presented their wares in a chatty afternoon tea-time setting, Eley Kishimoto took a chance on showing in a bigger gallery space for Fall. As ever, though, the joy of the collection was in the way it set off memories of clunky clothes we all wore, or saw our parents wear, in the '60s through the '80s. An Eley Kishimoto girl might sport a granny-ish print coat, knit beret and knee socks, thrown together with an innocent lack of regard for sex appeal. In the spirit of good humor, she'll go for a loopy rainbow-colored cardigan that suggests a distant relationship with a homey kitchen-sink rug, circa 1969. Checkerboard, circle and patchwork prints were much in evidence, in A-line corduroy skirts and pants and pretty silk skirts and dresses.</p><p>Underlying all this loving homespun stuff, though, these designers are savvy enough to be building business links with the outside world. The models were toting vanity cases, luncheon boxes and overhead-compartment wheelie bags designed for luggage manufacturer Globetrotter, done out in prints to match the clothes. Ditto the chirpy printed sneakers, cleverly done in collaboration with Converse.</p></div>"
45,fall,2002,f2002,emanuel-ungaro,"The job of Ungaro designer Giambattista Valli is to translate the richly exotic vision of his mentor, house founder Emanuel Ungaro, onto the ready-to-wear runway. Ungaro himself still designs the house's couture line where he explores his Parisian passion for femininity, luxe and the eclectic riches of the Orient and Africa. Valli's special knack, meanwhile, is for building a bridge between the sensibility of the house's older customer, and a hipper attitude that speaks to today's generation.</p><p>In his second collection for the company, Valli filtered Ungaro's north African, Chinese and hippie-deluxe romanticism into street-wearable shearlings inspired by djellabas, delicate printed chiffon floor-length caftan dresses and chinoiserie coats without skipping the all-important edge of embellishment. Where he best reached out to a younger audience though was in a treasure-trove of accessories that cried, ""Hunt me now!"" Stack-heeled, crumple-down suede boots, huge woven leather shoulder bags loaded with swishing fringe, silk rope and tassels, necklaces strung together from chunks of coral, beaten silver hearts slung on raw leather thongs—all are up there on the trophy-hunter's list for fall.</p></div>"
46,fall,2002,f2002,emilio-pucci,"Like a classic rock band whose fans only want to hear the hits, Pucci will forever be expected to produce variations on its swirling, colorful prints. Not that that's a bad thing; few fashion statements command such instant recognition. But making a serious sportswear collection from a breezy, humorous pattern is a tough project.</p><p>In his third season at Pucci, designer Julio Espada achieved mixed results. Inspired by the smart, minimal fashions of '60s London, he kept silhouettes mostly simple and close to the body, using jersey fabrics and minimal embellishment. There were nifty dresses and poet-sleeve tops that would jazz up Fall's predominantly black palette, as well as a few sharp jackets and a new Pop-influenced print. But the generally serious mood, and some odd color combinations like yellow and burgundy or aquamarine and orange, seemed at odds with Pucci's sunny, Mediterranean personality.</p></div>"

48,fall,2002,f2002,emporio-armani,"Few collections designed for real women at accessible prices ever get into the international fashion spotlight, but Emporio Armani does. The label once had the feel of a junior second line, but now the remit of Emporio has broadened to span the everyday lifestyle needs of women across a wide age range.</p><p>For Fall 2002, Emporio showed coats for every occasion from tough, fur-edged, black jackets, through roomy macintoshes with asymmetric sporty zippers to more formal, precisely fitted wool princess coats. While a masculine theme incorporated an oversized jacket shown with slouchy wide pants and mannish vests with cutaway racer backs, it was the Emporio advance on the feminine front that came as more of a surprise. High heels—a sighting as rare as the unicorn on an Armani runway—appeared in an extensive evening section that featured easy-to-wear velvet jackets and skirts, some with paper-bag waistlines and wide-sleeved blouses cut to slide on the body. But when bare dresses with plunging necklines edged in bugle beads ended the show, the audience was in shock: sex is turning up in some very unexpected places this season.</p></div>"
49,fall,2002,f2002,fendi,"Call it barbarian deluxe. Fendi's women are a tribe of warrior goddesses storming in from the woods with the season's most-prized fur trophies slung about their shoulders. At first sight these furs, with their raggedy raw edges, wild textures and sprouting tufts might look primitive, but the techniques lavished on them are the ultimate in sophistication.</p><p>""We cut the fur to shreds and then knitted it to treat it like a fabric to give it lightness and movement,"" explained Karl Lagerfeld, about a series of shrug-on coats and huge one-armed stoles, devised to be flung around the body as easily as blankets. A fur bolero, worn back to front with pieces flying behind, was worn by Frankie Rayder; a piebald cross-bred knitted mink bobbed on the shoulders of Devon Aoki, and a vast knitted fox stole trailed dramatically from the neck of Jacquetta Wheeler. Inventing new mixes of pelts and casual ways of wearing fur was the Fendi sisters original big idea, and Lagerfeld has kept their expertise at the leading edge of fashion since the 60s. At a time when many houses are marching forward by retrieving a sense of their own past, Sylvia Fendi said,""it was a very emotional show. We wanted to go back to our roots.""</p></div>"

51,fall,2002,f2002,gianfranco-ferre,"The architect of Milanese designers, Gianfranco Ferré thinks structurally and visualizes his designs around the image of an Amazonian diva. His Fall 2002 collection hit all the signature notes of his career, both in Italy and at Dior in Paris, and bore witness to his lifelong creative obsession with white shirts, the uses of leather, innovative tailoring and Japanese-influenced details.</p><p>For day, Ferré's updates looked best in a beige, rough-textured cardigan that wrapped over a white shirt and cinched at the waist with a leather obi, shown with pants, and in a belted, black, fur-lined sweat-jacket with a tight skirt cut with a kick flounce in back. His bias-cut Prince of Wales check pantsuits, meanwhile, showed his fiercely immaculate expertise in tailoring. For evening, Ferré's operatic Italian leanings were indulged in an entrance-making white organza blouse, one sleeve blooming with a cascade of ruffles like an overblown flower. Ferré also addressed the new Fall trend for pushing knitwear into uncharted territory by converting chiffon and taffeta into yarn and knitting them into complex open-stitched evening skirts and gowns.</p></div>"
52,fall,2002,f2002,giorgio-armani,"""No to excess, no to overdone nudity; no to the obvious and commonplace, no to sensationalism""—these words are Giorgio Armani's creative response to the realities of life post 9/11.</p><p>Armani's vision has always been about melding the utilitarian practicality of menswear with the softening influence of innovative fabric as evidenced in his first sequence of gray herringbone and Prince of Wales jackets shown with fluid pants. The soft-but-strong structure of an Armani jacket is a design landmark, and he emphasized it throughout cutting neatly fitting shapes with slightly pointed shoulders. Bellboy looks, short spencers and strap-fastened jackets were all teamed with voluminous pants, and many outfits were accessorized with the designer's new bags (the best was a large, dark brown leather boxy oblong style with handles). Through over eighty looks, Armani experimented with variations on the trouser theme from harem pants to knickers to pleat-fronted styles. He even pushed the design of the baggiest pants so that they appeared as a kind of skirt caught into stirrups near floor-level.</p><p>For evening, Armani sparkled via bugle-beaded bustiers, cutaway sequin dresses over pants and—the shining standout—a silver beaded jacket with a matching flower in the lapel.</p></div>"
53,fall,2002,f2002,givenchy,"Julien Macdonald has been handed the mandate to carve out a distinct, but commercially-viable identity for the house of Givenchy. For Fall—his second collection as creative director— Macdonald brought in a few of the design ideas currently making the rounds. Patchwork, handkerchief-point chiffon dresses, biker jackets and the somewhat exhausted Casbah look all made an appearance.</p><p>Macdonald opened with a grayish-brown distressed leather patchwork parka worn with gray leather pants and stacked knee-high boots. His take on biker leathers involved cutting and seaming the jacket short and close to the body, then adding an Elizabethan-style standup collar. There were also Walter Raleigh-esque bloomers worn with swashbuckling boots, English country house tapestries fashioned into coats and bags, Gloriana-style gilded brocade jeans and a tights-and-tunic look perhaps inspired by a few late-night Errol Flynn movies.</p><p>When he exerts his skills in knitwear—his original claim to fame—Macdonald does best, as he demonstrated briefly in this collection with a huge loopy black sweater and some laddered punk knits. But he quickly returned to glitzier looks, like a lame harem jumpsuit, a gold-edged djellaba coat and some café-au-lait-toned satins for evening. It was hard to find a uniting theme other than a feeling for the Eighties. But fashion skewered that decade to death a year ago, and there is still a sense that this collection is struggling to find a raison d'etre.</p></div>"
54,fall,2002,f2002,gucci,"In her skinny, skinny satin pants, vicious pointy ankle-strapped heels, tousled hair and falling-off-the-shoulder tops, the Gucci rock-chick is here stomping on stage for her come-back gig. And why not? When Tom Ford cut his smash-hits for Gucci in the mid-90s, they were for a woman with a fearlessly rockin’ attitude and a taste for dangerous luxe. Now she’s back with an even bigger, richer lineup of killer clothes to flaunt.</p><p>Ford lavishes the luxury in new larger volumes that run from a chunky black knit with fur embedded in the seams to zigzag jacquard kimono jackets pulled in with obi belts, and a black satin blouson jacket worn with a sexy, tight pencil skirt. There are lean pants cut with a natural waist and so long they crumple at the ankle, or leg-lengthening flares that flow over the foot. The outerwear pieces, like big raincoats and oversize “boyfriend” jackets, get a touch of glam with satin trim.</p><p>Ford lists his sources as the Hollywood of the ’20s and ’30s, a touch of Goth and an antique kimono collected on a trip to Japan, but his own obsession comes through in the intense details. “This is the most worked collection I’ve ever done at Gucci,” he said. “Women are only buying amazing items now. No one’s buying anything basic.”</p></div>"
55,fall,2002,f2002,hamish-morrow,"Was it the challenge of scaling the heights of a new fashion career that inspired Hamish Morrow? Shown in the depths of an underground car park, his 16-outfit collection, entitled ""Safety, Security, Suspension,"" referenced climbing as a central theme. Harnesses studded with Swarovski crystal were clipped to pants, and real climbers' rope was lashed around skirts and torsos.</p><p>Morrow's aesthetic is in the British intellectual mode, crossing the boundaries between traditional fabrics and hi-tech materials. His skill in experimental pattern engineering was evident in asymmetrical dresses and skirts layered over jersey body pieces, accessorized with bright Nike knee socks and flat sporty shoes. Rounded, enveloping jackets with curved seaming developed the idea of clothes to protect and cocoon the body, while Morrow's free-thinking approach to color juxtaposed conservative gray menswear fabrics, like Prince of Wales and melton, with neon yellow and magenta Gore-Tex. His finale was an outfit knitted entirely of nylon rope.</p><p>After four seasons, Morrow has established support from other top-ranking industry talents like Eugene Souleiman, who dressed the girls' hair in textured off-center ponytails, and makeup artist Lucia Peroni, who dabbed splashes of bright paint on their faces and ears. But survival on the London scene is an extreme sport: So far, Hamish Morrow is inching upward without the safety net of financial backing.</p></div>"
56,fall,2002,f2002,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang’s minimal take on power dressing has become a de facto uniform for the artsy executive set—the kind of customers who need to look cool but serious while hopping time zones and board meetings. His Fall collection, done primarily in black and white, is sure to keep them happy.</p><p>Lang always cuts a mean jacket, and this season’s version has a slightly built-up shoulder and narrower waist, in keeping with the changing silhouette. (He kept the pants long and lean.) Hoods were in plentiful supply, some on his well-known narrow-fitting coats and others on soft, oversized sweaters. Slashed and layered jersey pieces, meanwhile, added a tougher edge to the looks. The best group was a series of intricately twisted takes on fishermen’s sweaters, with oversized cables and random slashes, done in black or white chunky wool.</p><p>A lot of the collection felt familiar, and there were some odd pieces, like metallic pleated skirts, that might not fly past the occasional gallery opening. But Lang’s more straightforward looks will certainly satisfy his loyal following.</p></div>"

58,fall,2002,f2002,imitation-of-christ,"After last season's turn-the-tables collection, where models and editors traded places, Imitation of Christ went to the other extreme for Fall 2002. Set in that bastion of Upper East Side elegance, Sotheby's, the show drew a crowd that included Lou Reed, Jimmy Fallon, Natasha Lyonne, and avant-garde muse Isabella Blow. The audience was given catalogs that detailed the 31 outfits, each named for a piece of contemporary art and written up as if it were going on the block. The actual garments did finally appear, on models who adopted frozen poses on a rotating stage as an auctioneer took bids.</p><p>There were some charming pieces on display: lovely Grecian-draped dresses, a fetching skirt that looked as though it were made from an embroidered tablecloth, even a kicky little black lace skirt perfect for IoC fans like Lyonne or Chloë Sevigny. But in an era full of pastiche, handcraft and ethnic references, when IoC should be at the top of its game, the clothes were unfortunately overshadowed by the heavy-handed commentary on Big Issues.</p><p>At the end of the show, the lights dimmed and green lasers began playing around the room to the strains of Pink Floyd. When one fashion editor took out his lighter and held it up, in the classic ""Freebird"" gesture, it was hard not to feel as though you were trapped in freshman year of high school.</p></div>"

60,fall,2002,f2002,jean-paul-gaultier,"Brown paper packages tied up with strings; these are a few of Jean Paul Gaultier’s favorite things for fall. His runway was wrapped up in sheeting like a Christo art piece and the models bundled and bound like parcels in transit. Hangers and Stockman dress forms—the dummies used for fitting clothes—circulated on an overhead track so the girls could take off and put on jackets and coats as they strutted.</p><p>Gaultier used the packaging motif to bisect jackets, wrap the torsos in asymmetrically hemmed tunics, and bind legs in leather, as if with packing tape. The joke continued with trompe l’oeil outfits made to look as if the models were half-submerged in mail bags or leopard-spotted women caught up in net, human versions of exotic animals traveling in the luggage hold. Gaultier’s life-preserver gilets in puffy nylon or mink, and a tailored jumpsuit under a leather bomber jacket, strung out the in-transit story. The strongest pieces he delivered are in synch with the season’s trends: the skinniest green-washed jeans, crumpled at the ankle and long enough to hide the shoe, and his tailcoat, cut as a vest with a bolero jacket on top. But cutting loose from over-themed design would modernize his presentation no end.</p></div>"
61,fall,2002,f2002,jeremy-scott,"Jeremy Scott's New York debut ended fashion week with a jolt of high energy and—in a week of monochromatic, subdued tones—vivid color.</p><p>The Missouri-born designer, who came to fame in Paris before relocating to Los Angeles, chose New York to show his largest—and most commercially viable—collections to date. And while Scott may not be ready for prime time, he certainly entertained a jaded audience.</p><p>Scott opened with a series of very mini coats and dresses in amped-up sherbet tones, all infused with his Grace Jones–meets–Judy Jetson spirit (read: sky-high collars and exaggerated, cartoonish shoulder treatments). While the silhouettes were futuristic, the fabrics were resolutely traditional: wool felt, leather and soft jersey. One coat, a sheared mink wrap shown on an otherwise naked model, was basically a furry fig leaf. And while they were wacky, the clothes were well constructed: The manufacture was overseen by a former employee of the notoriously picky designer James Galanos.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hubtbj""></div></div><p>Scott's tongue-in-cheek attitude was very apparent, but he's also showing a new maturity as a designer. After the far-out coats, he showed a group of knit dresses that were eminently wearable. But those who lean to the left of fashion center shouldn't worry that Scott, who used to end his shows with a cry of ""Vive l'avant garde!"" has sold out. He ended the presentation with a group of elaborately constructed dresses designed to resemble New York City skyscrapers. If Björk needs something to wear to the Oscars, she need look no further.</p></div>"
62,fall,2002,f2002,jil-sander,"The name Jil Sander has always been a touchstone to subtle-minded, confident women who demand rigor and sophistication in their clothes. With Milan Vukmirovic in the design seat, the label has seen an infusion of comfort and color to which its avid followers should have no problem relating.</p><p>For Fall, the essential Sander values were reflected in two immaculate white coats, one in a bathrobe shape with a knitted collar, the other cut collarless in double-face cashmere. A strong line in office-appropriate cardigan knits ran through the show sometimes matched with long ribbed scarves and beanie hats. Those desperately seeking an interesting pantsuit, meanwhile, will find it in sand-colored needlecord, tailored on the bias with a stand-up collar—a creative twist on one of fall's ubiquitous fabrics. New to this formerly stark collection is the influx of the color purple and a concentration on feminine eveningwear—most successfully in a simple black velvet knee-length dress with long gathered sleeves, and a sweatshirt worn over a narrow beaded floor-length skirt.</p><p>Vukmirovic is not an abstract thinker, but he brought a new warmth to the collection by paying attention to the ideas of the women who surround him. ""The color purple came from listening to Prince,"" he said. ""The rest was my women friends telling me they wanted the knitwear, jogging pieces and scarves we'd done in the menswear collection.""</p></div>"
63,fall,2002,f2002,john-galliano,"It would take more words than are in this entire review to fully describe any single outfit in John Galliano's thundering, swirling, multi-everything Fall collection. ""Eskimo and Mongolian hotties! Keep the fur flying!"" was the backstage prompt to Galliano's tribe as they marauded out to flaunt patchworked and rose-embroidered shearlings, extra-flouncy skirts, chiffons, bobbly striped knits and a whole load more in the delighted faces of an audience that included Lenny Kravitz and Kate Moss.</p><p>Galliano likes to tease commentators by keeping a couple of leagues ahead of their ability to document his continent-hopping inspiration, basic-to-deluxe materials and bewildering repertoire of techniques. Suffice it to say that this show included Chinese brocade and dragon-head motifs, Spanish fringe, Scottish tartan, Peruvian pom-poms, American-Indian moccasins, lace-printed denim, salmon skin, satin embroidery, rough-hewn fur, and feathers.</p><p>Galliano is amongst the small band of designers who stand up for the value of individuality in a season when color, workmanship and the confidence of singular points of view have been all too frequently stifled by commercial pressure. The irony, of course, is that single pieces from this collection will look far more seductive on a store rack than any number of black cashmere turtlenecks.</p></div>"
64,fall,2002,f2002,julien-macdonald,"It's been a long time since models took it as part of their job description to va-va-voom to the end of the runway, throw a pose and come on to the photographers in a ""fabulous me"" kind of way. So long, indeed, that the joy-starved London crowd was seized by a sudden gratitude to Julien Macdonald for putting on a show that included go-for-it girls, glitter, gold and, yes, glam rock.</p><p>In a take-no-prisoners collection, Macdonald referenced the '70s heyday of David Bowie and Jerry Hall in flashy embroidered jackets, leopard spots, shaggy fox furs, sexy knickers, jumpsuits and unbuttoned satin vests. Exaggerated Bowie quiffs, big teased hairdos and fuchsia lipstick turned up Macdonald's aesthetic to full volume, a message that will be heard loud and clear by women who also love Versace and Roberto Cavalli.</p><p>What's the difference for Macdonald between designing in London and at Givenchy in Paris? ""I can be cheeky and sexy and take risks here,"" he said. ""Paris is bourgeois; in London, it's more fun. I'm swinging back to the old days of David Bowie and Anita Pallenberg, when British celebrity ruled the world. I just wanted to show my respect for London by showing here.""</p></div>"
65,fall,2002,f2002,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe's audience descended into the perma-gloom of the Salle Wagram, a turn-of-the-century venue off the Champs Élysées. The former music hall proved the perfect setting for Watanabe's elegiac—though far from morbid—show.</p><p>Watanabe's collection was composed almost entirely of dusty-gray '30s-styled dresses in satin, cotton and velvet, often bias cut and/or backless, and always in an artful state of distress. Hems were riddled with holes, as though the gray-lipsticked wearers had walked away from some disaster in their sturdy leather biker boots and crooked, incinerated Edwardian hats. The designer used patchworked textures of black, a minute sprinkle of silver beading on an embroidered dress, and a beautiful layering of black lace to veil a silver lining. Among the drifting horde of dresses were a couple of jackets, ridged with seaming in the technique Watanabe used for denim in his Spring show, and a stellar full-length raincoat full of drama and mystery.</p><p>Watanabe, who said after the show that he ""was feeling in the dark,"" may be reacting to the current state of the world. But he's a sensitive soul, more prone to bursts of cheerfulness than angst, and the collection came across as delicate and melancholy rather than doom-laden.</p></div>"
66,fall,2002,f2002,katayone-adeli,"Unlike some of the designers she's often grouped with, Katayone Adeli doesn't attack the latest trends with a sledgehammer; she checks in with the current mood and then goes off and quietly puts her own idiosyncratic slant on it. That's what has made her a star to the hip young women who stock up on her ever-popular pants and ultra-feminine dresses.</p><p>Adeli's Fall collection was true to form. The tiny, casual presentation she did at the last minute let editors see the clothes up close—all the better to admire the intricate passementerie on a fitted black wool jacket, the delicate smocking on a brown velvet top and the whimsy of a chunky, grandma-made-it sweater coat. While Adeli tends to think in terms of items rather than collections, she did work in a few tailored jackets that, paired with those low-slung trousers, would make a top-to-toe outfit for a major occasion. But this season's star is likely to be Adeli's take on that '70s classic, the army-green parka, which she sweetened with a sepia-toned wallpaper-print lining.</p></div>"
67,fall,2002,f2002,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole's expanding womenswear business is aimed at the same young fashion lovers who've taken so well to his footwear and accessories—well enough, in fact, to make him one of the industry's more successful publicly held companies.</p><p>The designer's Fall collection will not disappoint them, ranging as it did from trim pinstripe sweaters and boot-cut velvet jeans to slim jersey dresses and low-slung pencil skirts in tweed, suede, denim and leather. Cole did well with leather—as might be expected from a shoe-making veteran—showing looks like a glossy brown double-breasted trench and a supple camel suede jacket with red topstitching.</p><p>There were a few misfires, such as the tweed cargo knickers that opened the show and the heavy, hip-length Shaker knit tunics. And the short, preachy film titled <em>September 11, 2001</em> that opened the proceedings could have been dropped. But the clothes, fortunately, were message-free.</p></div>"
68,fall,2002,f2002,lagerfeld-gallery,"If idle hands are the devil's playground, Karl Lagerfeld is destined for sainthood. There's the Chanel and Fendi jobs, not to mention innumerable collaborations, photo projects, drawings, furniture designs, books, houses—OK, he's busy. But never too busy, it seems, to play with some fashion ideas. Which is where Lagerfeld Gallery comes in. Lagerfeld Gallery started out as a group of items shown at his Left Bank art gallery (hence the name), but has since evolved into a true collection.</p><p>Lagerfeld is particularly good at taking one or two big ideas and looking at them from all sides. For Fall, he played off two of the season's favorite icons: denim and black dresses. The famously slimmed-down designer clearly wanted to share his rediscovery of all things skinny. At the heart of the collection were skintight blue jeans (created for Lagerfeld by Diesel), boot-cut or as knickers and worn with teetering heels. He paired those with fitted jackets, crisp white shirts or black knit tops—perfect dressing for a woman who likes uncomplicated style that still packs a punch. When she's feeling a bit more like playing the sex kitten, Lagerfeld's customer will change into one of his satiny, figure-hugging black dresses or skirts and add a slouchy bag from another of the season's collaborators, accessories designer Matt Murphy. Simple ideas, made new and interesting—that's how Karl keeps his fashion wheels rolling.</p></div>"
69,fall,2002,f2002,lanvin,"With his first collection for Lanvin, Alber Elbaz successfully walked the finest of lines between design panache and desirable, grown-up clothes. Leaving a chic margin of raw edge on the most luxurious of fabrics, and cutting a beautiful compromise between the fierce and the feminine, he pulled off a feat of styling that augurs well for the future.</p><p>Elbaz opened his show with a dark brown, double-face coat with an irregular cascade of sequin running down the front. It was a signal that quality would be honored, but also energized with a shot of free-form creativity. That thread was developed via wrapper coats in, for example, slubby brown tweed with an unfinished edge running down the front, and in the way he frayed the edges of what might otherwise have been a matronly combination of a camelhair cape and dress. Elbaz’s sequence of chiffon dresses in subtle washes of neutral color were beautifully done, bound with multiple leather belts and held on by effortlessly complex twists and knots in the shoulder details. With their unhemmed edges—and especially when they were shown with high, pointy distressed leather spat-boots—they channeled ballerinas and pagan goddesses (and perhaps Claire McCardell) without seeming in the least bit fey.</p><p>Elbaz spanned luxe and casual by showing how good fur can look if worn simply with a gray tracksuit and high heels. He also cleverly put immaculate oversize overcoats over matching pantsuits with a mannish cut—a subtle reference to Lanvin’s identity as a successful seller of men’s suits. This was an optimistic start to a new chapter in Elbaz’s career (he was formerly at Guy Laroche, YSL Rive Gauche, and Krizia) and he was loudly applauded for it.</p></div>"
70,fall,2002,f2002,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele, an American who has lived in Milan since he first designed for Prada in the late eighties, pulled ideas from the thirties through the seventies into a collection for shoppers who demand a shot of opulence in their fashion cocktail.</p><p>Steele hit a glam sporty note with tracksuits made of burgundy crushed velvet; for extra flash, the evening version came in a strapless gold lame. Worn with high heels and Lurex socks, and maybe a little knit cloche jammed on the head, these are clearly clothes for girls who get their workouts on the dance floor. Short printed or sheer dresses with big sleeves slid off the shoulder and were hitched at the waist with tasseled silk rope belts, while a gold Lurex turtleneck came with a long trailing scarf to match. Underscored with off-hand furs—most successfully, a rabbit bomber and a shaggy patchwork coyote coat—the overall effect was kooky-deluxe. And when Steele turned on Princess Superstar's outrageously suggestive ""Bad Babysitter"" rap, the audience had trouble hiding its blushes.</p></div>"
71,fall,2002,f2002,loewe,"Madrid-based leather goods house Loewe—owned by fashion conglomerate LVMH—is attempting to work that now-commonplace fashion strategy: hire a young, critically acknowledged designer to create a buzz-generating ready-to-wear line, thereby boosting a venerable brand into a global powerhouse (see also Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, etc.)</p><p>José Enrique Oña Selfa's maiden effort as the house designer was a decent attempt. He seemed most comfortable when he stuck to his home ground of knitwear, or played up the house's ability with skins. Simple sportswear shapes rendered in butterscotch or vanilla-toned hides and fitted shearling coats with seams detailed in contrast leather didn't break any style ground, but will certainly speak to luxury leather fans everywhere. And though Oña Selfa lost his way with awkward knee-length hobble skirts and release-pleat wide leg trousers, the creamy wide leather belts and smartly constructed bags that ornamented many of the looks could be the start of a beautiful business.</p></div>"
72,fall,2002,f2002,louis-vuitton,"At Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs found a way to surprise and delight by turning his attention to the neglected middle ground between the glamorous and the everyday. Using a delicate, almost-there color palette and perfectly calibrated details, Jacobs conjured a sense of filtered 1950’s glamour that was never so exaggerated as to become literal.</p><p>The elegant and the rumpled were literally fused in the designer’s first two outfits, trompe l’oeil dresses that joined silky tops to knee-length alpaca skirts perfectly accessorized with satin Louis heel slingbacks. A throw-it-on attitude toward the ultra-luxe was cultivated throughout, especially via herringbone tweed pencil skirts with washed silk camisoles and casual white rabbit bombers. Jacobs paid attention to the LV monogram by scattering it discreetly over a black silk bomber paired with a sexy tight skirt, or embedding it in the little metallic mesh shoulder bag— this season’s quiet, yet undisputed monogram statement.</p><p>There was room for pure luxury, too, in crinkled lamé tops or sheared mink skirts banded with silver sequins. But the measure of Jacobs’ success in holding back from overstatement was in the way he made the appearance of a deep red cashmere cardigan—or the simplicity of a deep rose lipstick—suddenly seem like the height of glamour.</p></div>"
73,fall,2002,f2002,luella,"After a brief excursion across the prairie this Spring, Luella Bartley returned to the city for Fall, with a smart collection aimed at prepsters with a rock 'n' roll edge.</p><p>Bartley clearly spent time in study hall; she has the preppy vocabulary down cold, from three-quarter coats with toggle closures to navy poplin pieces with red topstitching. Also on the syllabus were pinstripe shirts, chunky wine-colored sweaters, soft corduroys and lots and lots of denim (including the show opener, a mini-trench worn by Gisele).</p><p>Although the collection was entitled ""Some Girls"" (the Rolling Stones were featured on a CD given out to accompany the show), Bartley can clearly be mother's little helper, too. Sweet jersey dresses, a simple navy sweater that buttons up the sleeves or a swinging, boxy black-and-white jacket easily jump the generation gap. And moms with hippie inclinations will definitely want to sneak into their daughters' closets for the superfly fringed belts by Katie Hillier or the nifty white sheepskin jacket.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ym8fj6""></div></div><p>While some of the '70s references were stretched too far—like a poncho made from red leather hearts crocheted together—the collection as a whole put a fresh, modern spin on some ever-popular classics.</p></div>"
74,fall,2002,f2002,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"It's rare for a secondary line to establish its own identity as distinctly as Marc by Marc Jacobs. Now going into its fourth season, the ultratrendy label has won the hearts of Jacobs' collection customers, not to mention the retailers who've watched his creased jeans and striped sweaters fly off their shelves. Even better, Marc has become a cult brand among fashion-savvy (is there any other kind?) high school girls.</p><p>For Fall, the designer remained true to his favorite decade, the '70s. A master of the artfully mismatched, Jacobs assembled deceptively simple, layered looks in those odd '70s color combos like blue/rust and brown/purple. (He even worked in a floral thermal shirt, putting it under a short-sleeve turtleneck.) As always there was plenty of denim, although corduroy and velvet also made their presence felt in jackets, skirts and flare-leg jeans; these had a line artfully bleached out around the hem, so they looked like they'd been shortened and then let down. Rounding out the collection were knee-length skirts, close-fitting blazers, baseball jackets, zip-front cardigans, great three-quarter coats and rainbow-striped sweaters, all accessorized with long knit fringed scarves.</p><p>Worn all together on the runway, the line looked fantastic. And real-world customers who limit themselves to individual pieces—there is, otherwise, a slight risk of being mistaken for Marcia Brady—are sure to be happy.</p></div>"
75,fall,2002,f2002,marc-jacobs,"For many at Marc Jacobs' show tonight, it was hard to forget that the last time this gathering took place was September 10. And while some of the outer trappings were the same—the star-studded front row included the likes of Anthony Kiedis, Sofia Coppola, and Kirsten Dunst—a sense of how things have changed permeated the event. The colorful high spirits of Jacobs' Spring collection have gone, replaced by subdued, achingly beautiful designs that are bound to be among the season's most coveted.</p><p>This was a delicate, even ethereal collection that made judicious use of Edwardian touches—seen in the velvet skirts and sheer black tea gowns—and military details like reverse lapels and piping on tailored trousers. The silhouette was long and lean, and most looks were made up of multiple layers—a dress over a T-shirt and trousers, with a waistcoat, for example. But Jacobs balanced his fabrics perfectly, ballasting the featherweight chiffons, cashmeres, crinkly lamé and satin with velveteen, crisp cotton, brocade, and cavalry twill. The palette was limited to shades of ivory and khaki, with occasional shots of azure, wine, or crimson—mostly looks for women, with about a quarter devoted to his growing menswear line.</p><p>Like a sunny Sunday morning after a long Saturday night, the collection was lovely, if slightly tinged with melancholy. But if the silver-sequined dazzler of a dress that closed the show is any indication, Jacobs is more than ready for all tomorrow's parties.</p></div>"
76,fall,2002,f2002,marjan-pejoski,"In an effort, perhaps, to escape forever being known as the designer of Björk's Oscars swan dress, Macedonian-born, London-based designer Marjan Pejoski fled the scene of the crime, as it were, and staged his Fall 2002 collection in Paris.</p><p>While Pejoski's beaded re-creation of Indian erotica recalled the designer's Spring 2001 collection (which featured Disney cartoon characters in pornographic poses), this show was rated PG. Suede anklets and boots gave a Peter Pan feel to coats and dresses that bloomed with embroidered foliage, flowers and butterfly wings. Pejoski's signature beadwork added some flash throughout, while patchwork jackets looked like they had been crafted by a savage child with a natural gift for needlework. The collection was strongest when it combined whimsy with discipline, as in the navy man-sized, sleeveless jacket embroidered with water lilies.</p><p>Though Pejoski's collection was very much attuned to London's current <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fixation, it nonetheless marked a development in the designer's career, showing that he could deliver a signature collection without gimmicks.</p></div>"
77,fall,2002,f2002,markus-lupfer,"Markus Lupfer's collection, shown in a lofty church in Notting Hill, was inspired by woodland nymphs, fairies and elves—part of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> tendency that is surfacing here and there this season.</p><p>Lupfer may have delved into his German romantic imagination for the storybook sources of this show, but what he produces is always done with a light, accessible spin. He mixed browns, dusty pinks and soft, iridescent greens in layerings of antique leather and chiffon that moved his collection out of the ladylike mode he established in the late '90s, and into something hipper. For Fall, his emphasis was on texture and detail: pony-skin jackets, nut-brown leather skirts that showed a kick of black-and-white print in the pleats, delicate lace-printed chiffon dresses over cashmere sweaters. Standouts were his coats, especially a swinging modernized riding coat seamed to curve into the waist and a geometrically pieced brown-and-black felt patchwork overcoat studded with wooden beads. With the addition of tribal-influenced braids and leather and coin jewelry, the result was a boho look Lupfer's Portobello followers will relate to.</p></div>"
78,fall,2002,f2002,marni,"Consuelo Castiglioni is the pied piper of gentle whimsy, drawing an ever-growing crowd of followers along her personal fashion path. Marni’s clothes never seem brand new, but come across instead like a haul of pretty vintage things remade and remixed with a naïve hand.</p><p>For fall, the Marni trip is all about faded multicolored bedspread patchworks, printed silk, chiffon and plaids that have been through the wash and come out soft and crinkled. Innocent cotton smocks, ’70s-feel suede patchwork coats, tiny brown suede jackets and capes were mixed up with cropped pants and fragile blouses with trailing asymmetric hems and chiffon scarves. Marni collectors will love the childlike spontaneity of details like the random placing of a bunny-rabbit appliqué, or the fact that some of the clothes are worn inside out with the seams showing. But this collection was hardly the answer to a poor girl’s dreams. Castiglione married into a family of furriers, and she hewed to the family tradition by working in unlined mink (worn with the patchworked piecing on the outside), cropped tenuki fur jackets, a feathery striped fox coat, and raw-edged wallaby stoles that tie on with ribbons.</p></div>"
79,fall,2002,f2002,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon's stock in trade is her oh-so-Parisian ability to confidently mix disparate elements, producing all those ""How do they do it?"" outfits that make women from other cultures pine. At her best, she blends flea market chic, historic references, an urban toughness and a wispy femininity to produce pieces that are distinctive, yet don't overwhelm the wearer.</p><p>Sitbon's fall collection, done mostly in black with occasional forays into gray, ivory and lavender tones, contained a lot of those signature looks. There were strong-shouldered jackets nipped at the waist, slim trousers, a silk bomber jacket and some pretty, fluid asymmetrical skirts and dresses. True, there was no shortage of oddball pieces—like chopped-off jodhpurs with flaring cuffs or an ivory skirt with a hiked-up hem—that seemed tricky and gratuitous. But weary closets could be easily refreshed by a puckered, sheer sweater, or one of the dip-dyed, screen-printed, artsy-girl dresses.</p></div>"
80,fall,2002,f2002,matthew-williamson,"Showing in New York for the first time, Londoner Matthew Williamson presented a collection titled ""Kaleidescape"" that arrived just like a Gypsy caravan might: embellished to the max and bursting with color.</p><p>Shocking, tropical hues of rose, peach, yellow and turquoise brightened trenchcoats, minis and pants—low-slung and tapered, or wide-waled and bell-bottomed—while shredded chiffon skirts were swirling patchworks of pattern and hue. Williamson's talisman this season was the number five (marking the number of years he's been in business), which was patched onto pockets, bags, trenches and military-style jackets. The designer's favorite Eastern motifs, like paisleys and abstract florals, made their way onto the beautiful hand-embroidered coat worn by Alek Wek and the chiffon dresses (really strapless saris) that closed the evening. Less successful were his continuing experiments with activewear, especially this season's Airtex dresses.</p><p>Williamson's pretty, if somewhat predictable, show included pieces that should appeal to both his established clientele and to younger (albeit deep-pocketed) customers. It will be interesting to see if he can develop a new audience by winning over typically black-clad New Yorkers.</p></div>"
81,fall,2002,f2002,max-mara,"The camel-hair coat is an icon for MaxMara; the foundation upon which one of Italy's most successful family fashion empire was built. The exercise each fall is to find new context in which to frame that timeless piece. This season's version is a creamy, floorsweeping topper flying loose over tight, high-waisted velvet pants and a turtleneck.</p><p>MaxMara acts as a percolator for current trends, making them accessible to a city woman who spends her money on wearable investments but likes to nod to fashion. For fall, she'll find that in an Alaïa-influenced flounced skirt with a matching bomber jacket, a 70s pants suit with a neat blazer, an ethnic fur-lined gilet, or the quintessential retro brown stacked-heel knee boot. Last fall's Art Nouveau mood reappears as Klimt-influenced prints, and peacock feathers made into capelets, jackets or as decoration on dresses and blouses. That's just enough to show a general awareness of the direction of fashion but not overpower the house's classic values, which are rooted as much in the pleasure of cashmere, velvet and suede as in the practicalities of a busy woman's everyday life.</p></div>"
82,fall,2002,f2002,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors went right for the heart of his customer with a Fall show that blended elegant luxury with down-home comfort.</p><p>Inspired in part by ""the rustic glamour of Aspen,"" Kors designed a collection perfect for one of his smart urban customers who might jump on her Harley on Friday and zoom off to spend the weekend skiing at Stowe. For the trip up, she'll put on one of his tough-girl chic leather motorcycle jackets and his skintight cotton ripstop pants; once there, she'll undo the knee-to-ankle zipper to make a sharp boot-cut trouser, and throw on a quilted leather anorak and hand-painted jeans or a fluffy knee-length coyote vest to hang out in the lodge. Après-ski, she'll slip into a feather-light cashmere baby doll or a camel pointelle jersey dress for hearthside lounging.</p><p>Kors covered the work week beautifully as well, with double-face wool pieces like a generous clutch coat over a short wrap-front skirt, lightweight cashmere dresses and sweaters, or a chic suede coat and pants hand-painted in a herringbone pattern. The bonus prize? With all the smart-looking new menswear Kors showed, her boyfriend can look just as good as she does.</p></div>"
83,fall,2002,f2002,michelle-loweholder,"In an uncertain climate, some of London's new names are taking the now-or-never leap to the official runway, after several seasons of informal, off-schedule shows. One such is Michelle Lowe-Holder, a Canadian designer specializing in knitwear who made her way onto the London scene via the prestigious fashion school Central Saint Martins.</p><p>With sponsorship from London's New Generation scheme, Lowe-Holder put on a show that signaled a change in direction since her last appearance. Her asymmetrical knitwear, in a bubbly sparkle-shot chenille, made for interestingly odd-shaped, almost free-form capes and sweaters. But she also made an effort to move away from London's underground rawness to something more grown-up and chic, with flowing divided skirts in jersey, high-waisted, pleated pants and, most successfully, a full-length hooded bathrobe dress in matte gray sequin.</p><p>The strain of moving from low-key presentations to the full glare of the catwalk seemed to have put the designer under pressure to perform in a different character, leaving even some of her followers wondering who the real Michelle Lowe-Holder might be.</p></div>"
84,fall,2002,f2002,missoni,"It's a knit season and individuality has never been such a driving force in fashion. Put those two factors together and Missoni is perfectly poised to win the hearts of eclectic shoppers. Angela Missoni's talent for joining multicolored pattern and modern woman styling is the thread that runs exuberantly through this collection. She knits in references to artistic and folkloric cultures from all over the world—Peruvian stripes, a touch of the Tyrol, hints of Morocco and for a historical touch some right-on-trend art nouveau butterfly markings.</p><p>Missoni's knack is making this melee of stripes, zigzags, swirls and fringe into appealing urban clothing. There's a vertically striped multicolor ribbed dress suspended on straps and matched with a long scarf, a knit coat patterned like a swirly carpet, a djellaba cardigan with a zip front. Loopy yarn is made into a stole, while wooly South American-style fringing was a new note for one of the season's recurring themes. Pulled together with the soft browns, purples, greens and oranges of the moment and some great bags, Missoni is full of treasures for fashion's individualists to pick through and make their own.</p></div>"
85,fall,2002,f2002,miu-miu,"While Prada is designed for adult-only sexual sophisticates this season, Miu Miu is for the naughty little sister who has a saucy act all her own. This is a girl out to prove she can look provocative even in a beige raincoat, when it’s cut short and worn with head-turning hotpants and a cute sou’wester.</p><p>So what if she didn’t actually live through early ’70s? This expert young flirt makes free with quirky versions of fashions her mother knew so well. Styles like stiff culottes, doubleknit halter rompsuits, corduroy coats, chiffon blouses, and patch pockets applied in contrasting colors. All that cranberry, violet, brown, yellow and green. She adores the mumsy no-no of shiny quilting when it’s made up into a pair of nutty emerald green overalls or a nipped-in navy trench. And those cute little jackets that tie in the back to emphasize her trim curves are irresistible. But then, why should she exercise restraint? After all, life’s a blast when you’re in charge of a fab body and a pair of great legs.</p></div>"
86,fall,2002,f2002,moschino,"Like that bubbly blonde in the teen movies who manages to trump the smart alecks with one perfect aperçu, Moschino lightened up a somber fashion week with a breezy, pretty collection that left viewers smiling.</p><p>Michele Hicks opened the show with a saucy strut, her sexily mussed hair spilling onto a cool black parka and wrap dress. Much of the collection was black, but without being goth-heavy or industrial-serious; instead, flowing fabrics and trim silhouettes kept it feminine and light. Moschino creative director Rossella Jardini acknowledged the house's history by slinging a few of those gold block-letter MOSCHINO belts around the hips on her tailored looks, and by courageously, if not always successfully, mixing bold prints. There were a few overly fussy bloopers, like a droopy safari-styled jumpsuit and a surfeit of miscast ruffles. But for the most part, Jardini—like that typecast blonde—was clearly having fun.</p></div>"
87,fall,2002,f2002,narciso-rodriguez,"A few days before his show, Narciso Rodriguez said that he had taken inspiration from the work of legendary designer Cristobal Balenciaga, who combined masterful tailoring with simple but elegant designs. And in the superb collection he showed tonight, Rodriguez demonstrated his ability to bring those elements to a modern wardrobe.</p><p>Rodriguez kept the silhouette long and lean, contouring dresses and shirts to the body with clinging inset bodices and introducing an elongated tunic top. A minimalist by nature, his palette was white, black, cream, gray and gold, although there were—how shocking!—two blush-pink dresses. Boxy jackets with slightly rounded shoulders hung just to the waist of slightly flared, tailored trousers or knee-length pencil skirts; silky, fluid blouses wrapped loosely in front. Even Rodriguez's fur was restrained: He showed inky sheared mink pieces—a short jacket, a tunic, a narrow coat—that looked at first glance like particularly plush velvet.</p><p>For evening Rodriguez raised the glamour quotient a hair by simply adding a whiff of beading to a satin shirt, or offering a heavy gold pencil skirt. And as if that weren't enough, he sent out a group of satin glamour dresses, each with its own version of a ruffle at the back. Restrained, refreshing and quite beautiful.</p></div>"
88,fall,2002,f2002,oscar-de-la-renta,"No one would really have expected Oscar de la Renta to adopt the sober palette that's dominated the runways this week. But just in case there was any doubt, the designer announced his direction even before the first model appeared, projecting a mosaic of colorful photos taken at Moroccan open-air markets—fruits, flowers, spices—onto the stage front.</p><p>There was a whiff of far-flung exoticism throughout the collection, although it was grounded in city-smart sportswear. De la Renta started with nubby cashmere sweaters, limpid ruched tops and soft wool poet-sleeve blouses, paired with tailored flannel pants and skirts in gray, moss green, taupe and black. But almost every outfit got a touch of spice via embroidery, a dusting of sequins, even a cowrie-shell fringe, along with exotic belts trimmed in coins, studs or smooth horn buttons.</p><p>Beautiful, delicately decorated coats have become fixtures in de la Renta's collections, and this one was no exception: There were opulent styles, like the silk patchwork version lined with sheared mink, alongside low-key versions in black cashmere or silk twill with a light touch of embroidery or beading.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qsobc""></div></div><p>De la Renta ended, as always, with a parade of great eveningwear: simple lace dresses, densely ruffled skirts and a group of glorious, diaphanous blouses with generous poet sleeves—just the thing for midnight at the medina.</p></div>"
89,fall,2002,f2002,peter-som,"Peter Som, a Parson's graduate with a degree in art history, interned with Calvin Klein and Michael Kors before accepting a position with Bill Blass. One of the five designers singled out by <em>Vogue</em> as a member of ""generation next"" in their celebration of American fashion, Som's first show was a much anticipated event that did not</p><p>Som described the collection as ""fiercely feminine,"" and delivered on that promise with a show executed in a palette of navy and black that opened with Alek Wek in a strapped and buckled harness coat. Although the sharp-edged, hardware-embellished theme featured heavily, this confident collection was actually strongest in its softer moments. (It's hard to look at harnesses without thinking of Helmut Lang.)</p><p>Pieces like a midnight sheath worn with an embroidered obi, and a wrap skirt with floating ribbon streamers, were both pretty and sharp. Fluid slouch pants, paired with a tank and shearling vest-wrap, and a well-tailored wool smoking suit with innovative sleeve details, showcased the elegance and all-American ease for which Som is becoming known.</p></div>"
90,fall,2002,f2002,philosophy,"Last season she was a virgin. Since then, Alberta Ferretti's innocent girl has been allowed out to a couple of gigs, or maybe taken a year off to do some traveling. In any event, her summer of drifty white eyelet is over and she's turned the corner into a tougher kind of teenager. In her wardrobe now is an eclectic mix of Chinese jackets and vests, grunge-influenced plaid, and a lot of tiny smock dresses—but always worn with woolly ribbed tights and flat boots or shoes.</p><p>Ferretti's addition of menswear shirt stripes and distressed leather coats give this girl enough to wear when she wants to hang out with the cool gang, but she's still a sweetheart underneath it all. Those signature Empire-line coats and chiffon dresses are still true to her good-girl nature. Daddy, meanwhile, will be relieved to discover that his little girl's idea of great nightlife is still a pajama party.</p></div>"
91,fall,2002,f2002,pierrot,"No one could accuse Pierrot of lacking imagination. For his Fall 2002 show, the knitwear maven performed not one, but two transformations: He conjured a fairy-tale atmosphere from the dank interior of dance club Webster Hall, and he dressed just about every character from the Brothers Grimm in a nifty outfit.</p><p>Little Red Riding Hood sported a peaked hood, Snow White had a floor-length white skirt and the supporting cast of elves and toy soldiers each got snug, whimsically decorated sweaters, often paired with skin-tight knickers or ruffled skirts so short, they should rightfully be called tutus. The biggest crowd-pleaser, though, was elegant veteran model Carmen Dell'Orefice, who played Snow White's evil stepmom to the hilt, sweeping her black, spider-decorated cape across the floor as she enticed audience members with glistening red apples (no one took a bite).</p><p>For the more workaday heroines among us, Pierrot produced straightforward knitwear like sexy, body-hugging dresses, lacy crocheted knee-length skirts, puff-sleeve tops and a black sweater dress with white crocheted lace at the neck and cuffs. Pierrot is not afraid of color: The palette moved from red, white, blue and black to lavenders, green, brown and gray, before ending with—of course—a snowy white bride. Aside from a few overly heavy pieces like a cape weighed down by granny squares, Pierrot spun a pretty yarn, indeed.</p></div>"
92,fall,2002,f2002,prada,"Thank you, Miuccia Prada, for reminding us about sex. Tight skirts that show a woman’s shape, high crocodile boots, see-through macs, and models that are the antithesis of innocent waifs. All these factored into a collection that sent the fashion world spinning away from its current fixation with hippie peasant clichés.</p><p>In a show that was densely layered with references to the history of fashion, Prada cut a strong, curvaceous and erotically charged line to give grown-ups a whole new reason to buy. From the moment Eva Herzigova appeared, silhouetted in a black nylon bomber jacket with fur sleeves and a black, wickedly seamed skirt, it was obvious Prada had her sights set on a new kind of adult sophistication. High-waisted tweed skirts, bomber jackets cut to show the waist, and blouses with stiff puffed sleeves signaled her belief in the power of a new, hard chic. Revisiting structured tailoring—which is where she began in the ’90s—was only one of her ideas. She also worked in duchesse satin, gathered at the neckline to emphasize breasts, Monroe-esque silk sunray pleats, and ’30s showgirl lingerie playsuits. Great oversized rubberized raincoats with inside-out seams and a black satin jockey cardigan with knit sleeves also stood out from what was a vast inventory of must-have items.</p><p>Prada referenced many of her own past collections, from her bourgeois ladylike phase to her militaristic moments and her love of vintage lingerie. But her achievement was in making something inspiringly new out of confronting a personal taboo. “I was fed up with people saying I can’t do sexy clothes!” she stated backstage. It was said with a laugh, but the designer has done nothing less than change the fashion agenda overnight.</p></div>"
93,fall,2002,f2002,rafael-lopez,"Fur hasn't been seen on the London runway since the late Princess Margaret was a girl. But this season, it's a growing trend being pursued, unexpectedly, by some of the city's youngest designers. One of these is Rafael Lopez, a Spaniard who passed through Central Saint Martins College of Art and various jobs in Italy before returning to show his own collection here.</p><p>Lopez clearly has an appreciation for femininity and a Latin yearning for luxe: Witness his jacket made of strips of sage-colored mink, and coat of patchworked leather, suede and chinchilla. His collection looked best when he used dark-chocolate silk velvet in casual shapes—like bomber jackets or low-slung cropped pants that laced at the side of the leg—or black velvet for a slouchy sweatshirt and swishy full skirt. Other great show pieces were a sculptural suede bubble skirt and an oversized cardigan. Many of Lopez's evening dresses, pieced and patchworked in Art Deco patterns, were overly influenced by Balenciaga's ""Victorian"" collection—but that's far from a rare phenomenon this season. And while the fashion press waits impatiently for young designers to get over Ghesquière, it's allotting creative credits to those who show sparks of their own individuality. On that count—and boosted by the fact that his small Summer collection flew at retail—Lopez has officially joined the ""worth watching"" list.</p></div>"
94,fall,2002,f2002,ralph-lauren,"After his all-white Spring show, Ralph Lauren turned in a serious, elegant Fall collection that was almost entirely black. The high-ceilinged library of his Madison Avenue headquarters formed an appropriately scholarly backdrop for a show that embraced historical references—best seen in a lovely fitted, puff-sleeve Victorian top that stopped just above the waistline for a sexy glimpse of skin.</p><p>The designer kept silhouettes clean and close to the body, lending texture to his outfits by juxtaposing humble and high-scale, rough and supple: cotton cargo pants worn with a soft ruffled chiffon shirt and a supple velvet jacket, for example, or a cropped embroidered shearling jacket over a clinging velvet gown.</p><p>Jackets are making a concerted comeback, and Lauren offered a baker's dozen, each with its own attitude. Downtown hipsters will pick the cropped, fitted styles, or put the reworked chalk-stripe morning coat with a pair of jeans; uptown types will love the ladylike styles that hug the waist and flare slightly over the hips.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""i9buyi""></div></div><p>The biggest news was Lauren's new strength in eveningwear, which ranged from stay-at-home elegance—a beaded cashmere sweater and wool flannel pants—to the all-out glamour of embroidered silk gowns.

95,fall,2002,f2002,richard-edwards,"Designing duo Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick showed their first women's collection three seasons ago, having won praise and attention for their menswear line. Their haberdashery roots figured large for Fall, with classic silhouettes and simple fabrics contributing to the show's highlights. The low-slung trousers—those left devoid of tricky draping effects—as well as a few clingy black dresses and a lovely ivory wrap coat showed a talent for polished simplicity. But too many odd ideas, such as oversize cowl sweaters, rope halter dresses and pants with apron attachments, cluttered up their message.</p></div>"

Today he presented a Fall collection entitled ""Sparrow"" that showed the technical skill and romantic-goth vision that's won him a loyal—and burgeoning—fan base. ""We've carried him for the last five years, and our business just keeps growing,"" said Ed Burstell, vice president and general manager of Henri Bendel. ""It's a cult; women love the way he fits the body.""</p><p>The mood of Owens' presentation was somber—a dark, raw space and a sound track of Alice Cooper and Iggy Pop—but the clothes were gently sexy and even cozy. Not one for color (despite his indigenous climate), Owens worked in grays, chalky white, black and taupe. Long clinging dresses were paired with fuzzy ankle-length sweater coats, while soft, baggy corduroy pants looked great with the distressed leather jackets the designer is known for. Judging by a black corduroy tuxedo jacket, Owens can do traditional tailoring, but his real love is innovative draping.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""v3pvqo""></div></div><p>Owens pays as much attention to the back of a garment as its front, creating fishtail trains and clever details, like an unexpected hood made from a swell of fabric. Most outfits were topped by a monkish balaclava helmet, emphasizing the elongated, flowing silhouette and lending a cultish, otherworldly air to the proceedings.</p></div>"
97,fall,2002,f2002,roberto-cavalli,"In the world of Roberto Cavalli, nothing succeeds like excess. The highest heels! The super-est supermodels! More, more, more! The sight of Cindy Crawford and Eva Herzigova throwing curves in tight dresses, pencil-skirted suits and knock-your-eye-out prints brings back the good old eighties Italian-style.</p><p>Cavalli's ideal woman is a rock-star's wife, and it's no coincidence that his growing cult following is music business people and good-time girls everywhere who dream of a piece of the arm-candy action. Each show is like the next installment in a so-bad-it's-good soap opera, and this fall we see our heroine in possession of the keys to her first French chateau. Now she's a lady and her idea of dressing the part means slipping into a scarf-print dress or a trompe l'oeil satin blouse with a few fabulous estate jewels printed on the front. For polite cocktails, her little black dress is seamed to outline her very personal assets. Inspired by the neat old brocades in her new home, she's had some cool jeans and jackets made in the same fabric. And for those post-gig parties, she'll knock the competition dead in a brown patent leather vixen suit or maybe that white fur floor-trailing parka with the snakeskin pants. Whatever, the girl's arrived.</p></div>"
98,fall,2002,f2002,roland-mouret,"The excitement in watching Roland Mouret is the way he walks a fine line between French romanticism and the London gutter. As a Frenchman, he's obsessed with making beautiful fabrics run over a woman's body like a whispered compliment; as a guy who lives in London, he knows a Gallic cliché when he sees one.</p><p>Mouret's clothes are for women who can't stand overdressing at night, but still want to turn on the seduction. Which they can do perfectly in a chiffon dress with billowing sleeves, or a dramatically simple neck-to-floor column of black jersey that turns to show a naked back. Newer for Mouret this season is his addition of structured tailoring, like belted jackets with strong shoulders, bouclé pants and a navy trenchcoat with overstitched seaming, all with a faintly '40s air. Even more impressive is the changing backdrop against which Mouret's clothes are shown. What was once an off-schedule date in gritty Bermondsey is now an affair amongst gleaming chandeliers in Christie's. Flattery will get you everywhere.</p></div>"
99,fall,2002,f2002,ruffo-research,"Ruffo Research is a kind of nursery project for new fashion talent. Each year, an independent design company is selected to do two guest collections, enjoying the benefits of Ruffo’s extraordinary expertise in producing leather. This fall is the second and final season for Alexandre Matthieu, the French partnership of Alexandre Morgado and Matthieu Bureau.</p><p>The design duo’s signature is a young Parisian version of feminine street-chic, a vision they expressed via seamed corset tops and dresses shown over sweatshirts, and coats and pants decorated with geometric-patterned overstitching. The opportunity to experiment with Ruffo’s leather techniques produced distressed chestnut leather jackets, a long cable-stitch cardigan knitted from leather yarn, and what looked like white-painted crackled surfaces on bombers decorated with sliced fringing. The standouts were the gold leather biker coat and satchels, one of which was also gold, reminiscent of army surplus bags.</p><p>Alexandre Matthieu’s relatively quiet shows came after a succession of edgier Ruffo guest designers: Véronique Branquinho, Raf Simons, A.F. Vandevorst and Sophia Kokosalaki. Speculation on who’s been headhunted for 2003 will be settled by a formal announcement in April.</p></div>"
100,fall,2002,f2002,russell-sage,"When Russell Sage put a heap of gleaming coins center-stage at his show as payback to his mortgage-lender sponsors, Britannic Money, the audience had an opportunity to contemplate the deeper symbolism: Can UK fashion stay solvent?</p><p>If money was in the spotlight, though, talent—and lots of it—was also on display. As his first model appeared in a waisted, full-skirted dress made from eighteenth-century golden silk curtain fabric, complete with tassels fringing the hemline, Sage instantly proved the value of British designers' gloom-busting resourcefulness. He followed up with equally spirit-lifting, richly romantic one-of-a-kind pieces fashioned, Scarlett O'Hara-wise, from antique drapes. Sage's silhouettes might be vaguely outlined on 1950s couture volumes, but his crafting of materials, raw edges, arty embroideries and jigsaw-puzzle piecing are strictly 2002. And after mastering the new feeling for gilded fabric, he effortlessly nailed another major trend: brilliant chunky knits. Working with Bidyut Das, a knitwear graduate from the Royal College of Art, Sage sent out a spectacular high-waisted gray wool dress, knitted in graduated stitch to fall to the floor in sculptural waves. Wound along one arm was a huge spiral glass armlet with a $25,000 diamond embedded in it.</p><p>Cash-poor but imagination-rich, London designers like Sage still have the optimism (not to mention sponsors like the Diamond Information Centre and Swarovski) to help them face the challenge of staying afloat. ""It's really tough,"" he says. ""But I don't think I could show anywhere else. And remember: McQueen and Chalayan came out of London's last downtime.""</p></div>"
101,fall,2002,f2002,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford is very, very good at being wicked. The designer was in an adult-erotic frame of mind at Yves Saint Laurent, taking potential clichés such as black satin ribbon, taffeta, velvet, chantilly lace and fur and applying them in an offhand way to extravagant, body-emphasizing pieces that often looked as if they might fall off at the slightest pull of a bow. What, after all, could be more provocative than a woman wearing expensive clothes that look as if they were made to be undone by a lover?</p><p>The silhouette was an elaboration of the one he’d set at Gucci: a generous top and the tightest, rumpled, to-the-knee skirt, skinny pants, or the season’s first genuinely chic knickers done in black velvet. This time he worked the volume into blouses and jackets with dropped shoulders and billowing eighteenth-century sleeves—a device he used most gorgeously in a dark blue velvet coat with huge puffs, lace and mink embellishing the cuff. The show was full of amazingly detailed, sexily cut suits, fabulous coats and sweeping evening gowns delicately inserted with lace.</p><p>Ford did many riveting things with ribbons and bows. They recurred holding together the seams of a skirt, in a quilting pattern on a suede biker jacket, or as whole skirt made of strips of Chantilly lace. Best of all was a midnight blue velvet suit with a jacket slashed in the back, closed with a row of bows in black satin. It just may have been the most provocative look of the entire season.</p></div>"
102,fall,2002,f2002,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel's muse is a sexy businesswoman who knows full well that the guys are checking out her legs, but blithely seals the deal anyway. Of course, that's also Rykiel herself—a working woman who doesn't think sex appeal should be left in the bedroom.</p><p>Her Fall 2002 collection, with its fluttering bows, narrow black pants and pencil skirts, fluffy fur vests and minis, and sheer knits hit on most of fall's major trends. But Rykiel has been there, done that well before most of the designers who took a bow this week, and she knows how to make the season over in her image. For starters, there's her notoriously skinny cut, shown to advantage in numerous clingy knit tops and dresses, and her typical touch of Forties retro in the coats. And in this season of the knit, those horizontal stripes and ballerina necklines couldn't be anybody but Sonia.</p><p>Things did occasionally stray off course—especially some droopy tweeds, an interlude of acid green and a surfeit of kimono-sleeved fur coats. But when Rykiel closed the show with an eye-popping gang of models, all in brightly colored off-the-shoulder sweaters and droopy-brimmed hippie hats, it was clear that she still knows how to work a room.</p></div>"
103,fall,2002,f2002,sophia-kokosalaki,"The mob scene at the door of Sophia Kokosalaki’s Fall show was reminiscent of Alexander McQueen’s last days in London. And this time, the crowd included McQueen himself, struggling through heavies and St. Martin’s student gatecrashers to watch the greatest remaining hope of this city go through her paces.</p><p>It was certainly the most polished collection London has produced this season, even though Kokosalaki reverted from the gentleness of her Summer show back into the darker sources of her imagination. To the hard-driving, neo-industrial beats of Kraftwerk and Joy Division, she showed a collection based on black, with an intense concentration on the kind of lashed-together collage cutting seen at Balenciaga, Helmut Lang and Hussein Chalayan. Kokosalaki said she had been thinking about “typography and texture—and, without being religious, about the symbolism of crosses and runes.” Which translated into jackets and tops cut away to resemble jigsaw puzzles of fabric, then strung together with spider-web threads across the torso. The skill Kokosalaki refined during her stint at Ruffo Research, meanwhile, was amply evident in her highly desirable signature leather bombers, decorated this season with curlicued embroidery inserts. And her Greek heritage was referenced in pants that were tucked, Cretan peasant–style, into flat, black knee boots. This designer knows where she's coming from. The question is, where is she headed next?</p></div>"
104,fall,2002,f2002,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney has built a reputation on her ability to gauge what women of her generation want to wear. In her second collection under her own name, McCartney, now 30, did an about-face from her jokey, nightclubby presentation for Spring, and set off in a newly sophisticated direction.</p><p>The designer sent out gentler layerings of the turn-on pieces she's become known for starting, with satiny, slightly padded parkas featuring raw edges and a tracery of the naïve hand-stitched embroidery she's used before. The cool factor was there, but McCartney also unified the whole collection with a subtle color statement—soft, elusive tints of oyster, ivory, plaster pink, washed-out grays and mossy faded greens. Her super-narrow gray-ish jeans zipped at the ankle and combined with high-heeled, two-tone pumps with round toes provided the base on which she layered georgette dresses and some great tops. Chunky cable knits and a fashion-freak version of the classic U.S. Air Force aviator jacket looked strong, but not too street. McCartney's takes on tuxedos, high-waisted double-face cashmere coats and long chiffon gowns rounded out a collection in which she drew a line in the sand about who she is, who she's addressing, and where she's going next. The girl has grown up.</p></div>"
105,fall,2002,f2002,strenesse,"The artsy, retro wave that swept over many of Milan's collections this week—ethnic influences, girlish silhouettes and asymmetrical hemlines—seems to have crested with the Strenesse collection. Strenesse designer Gabriele Strehle has always injected a little downtown gallery-owner attitude into her commercially appealing sportswear; but this season it looks like she bought a loft in SoHo, c. 1985, and has Laurie Anderson coming over for dinner.</p><p>Strehle showed a mostly black collection heavy with Japanese references such as kimono sleeves, torso-wrapping obi belts, and the rosy-toned print that leavened the monochrome palette, showing up in loose blouses and fluid, knee-length dresses. While there were good-looking pieces with appeal to any serious fashion follower—a generously cut black trench and some gleaming, feminine black satin dresses—Strehle stuck too close to a bygone—albeit important—fashion era.</p></div>"
106,fall,2002,f2002,valentino,"With a bounce of their blow-dried, lacquered hairdos, a crowd of blonde bella donnas stepped out on the runway, decked head-to-gold-booted-toe in Valentino's vision of uptown chic. The designers' classic themes were out in force in a collection that played on his reputation for ultra-feminine tailoring, and paid homage to his rich archive of eveningwear.</p><p>For day, Valentino's coats, prettily cinched at the waist and full in the skirt, were trimmed with deep bands of fur. He showed city-proper tweed and camel and added excitement to suits with long, fluid pleated skirts by slitting them to show a flash of leg. He even nodded to the biker trend of the season by cutting the most curvaceous leather jackets in town. But Valentino's woman is no streetwise toughie. She prefers to shine at all times, which is why her accessories—boots, bags, gloves and metallic leaf-shaped belts—came in gold, gold and more gold. For dinner, she loves a black lace blouse with poetic sleeves, a cute tiered taffeta smock and a lovely high-waisted coat, fastened under the bust with a black satin bow. She's even happier when given license to go all out for grand evening events. Valentino is at hand to offer every glam option in the book, from floor length gold-sequined gowns, through stately black taffeta, right up to the eye-popping classic red dresses that closed his show in the time-honored fashion.</p></div>"
107,fall,2002,f2002,vera-wang,"Vera Wang became a household name putting women into white dresses. But as her all-black fall 2002 collection made clear, she has a sophisticated dark side, too.</p><p>Wang's strength has always been in evening wear, and her fall collection was a kind of historical survey of luxurious glamour. There were Victorian touches, including handwork-intensive details like pintucking and beading, high-necked furry capelets, and corset references. The Thirties were referenced via bias-cut silk charmeuse or an occasional flurry of ostrich feather decoration. A fitted, quilted top that Wang called a ""fencing jacket"" paired with a matching mini looked distinctly 60s-era Mod, and one knee-grazing dress sported a shades-of-the-Eighties pouf. There were also plenty of skin-baring separates like a chiffon halter over lacy boot-cut trousers, which were thoroughly up-to-the-minute.</p><p>Wang has been on a roll this year, publishing a book about weddings as well as launching her first fragrance in a bid to expand her business. But this collection makes it clear that she's still got a firm grip on her first priority: beautiful clothes for gala-filled lives.</p></div>"
108,fall,2002,f2002,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho has a remarkable talent for treading lightly through the season's important trends while never showing a single piece that could be called ""trendy."" Take lamé or collage and contrast fabrics or trompe l'oeil dresses. Or then again, take knit-art, velvet, satin, military, men's wear influences, and all those indescribable nuances of pale, dusted-to-nothing tones of pink, misty grays, oyster and fawn. Branquinho has it all, and still emerges looking like no one but herself.</p><p>The gold lamé came muted and antiqued—and excused of all vulgarity—in a long sleeved peasant dress with a square bib of brocade. The knits included jacquard turtlenecks, patterned like Victorian wallpaper and fluted dresses with full, striped skirts. Branquinho showed khaki bombers sometimes with her signature gathered yoke, and new versions of the coats with the tiny puff in the shoulder line she originated in the late '90s.</p><p>Branquinho's approach encompasses both a non-wimpy sense of poetry and real wearability. She cuts a flattering mannish pant, a fabulous tailored velvet jacket and has the kind of stacked narrow-heeled boots that will make absolutely everything in a woman's wardrobe work for fall. She's also got the skill to experiment on classic and even frumpy ideas, tipping them into avant-garde territory. Her versions of Chanel tweed suits, cut narrow and with the edges left frayed, are certain to wield star influence next season.</p></div>"
109,fall,2002,f2002,versace,"The video walls exploded in a kaleidoscope of color, and Amber Valletta, grown-up and gorgeous, strode onto the runway in a swinging psychedelic print cashmere coat shrugged over a white turtleneck and pants. It was the opening shot in a collection in which Donatella Versace proved herself in supreme control of a powerful new classiness.</p><p>Color and sexiness are to be expected—even demanded—at Versace. But the surprise was how Donatella delivered on that while showcasing outstanding, couture-standard clothes with a five-star wearability rating. ""I wanted to do quality and tradition—but with fun,"" said the designer. Versace coats are some of the most gorgeous of the season, impeccably cut and with embroidery, quilting or edgings and inserts of leather expertly deployed to emphasize shape. There was casually luxurious fur, sheared inside and out to look like corduroy. Some of the best looks were the collection's most spare: a neon yellow cashmere tank with black flares and a huge black bag, a candy pink double-face coat paired with a tank and lilac pants, even a restrained, oversized black coat, its buttonholes edged in satin, thrown over a plain black pantsuit. There were great bright micro-flower print dresses and the obligatory slit-up-to-there red-carpet evening gowns. But Donatella's knockout punch was putting glamour, color, excitement—and, believe it or not, simplicity—into an adult woman's day.</p></div>"
110,fall,2002,f2002,versus-versace,"Unlike the '70s and '80s references that have populated the runways lately, Donatella Versace referenced a more recent decade for Versus in a brightly colored upbeat collection inspired by the '90s and acid house culture. That might seem a bit off the mark even in today's accelerated retro cycle, but never mind. It worked just fine.</p><p>Carmen Kass kick-started the show in a sky-blue rabbit fur coat and skintight jeans that stretched down over the shoes. Those jeans, some ruched down the outside seam, others splashed in purple, orange and blue came in cotton velvet and washed cord and showcased Donatella's savvy about what girls really want to wear. She used a hoodie sweatshirt as one of the core pieces layering in cut-off, raw-edged skirts over pants and adding in T-shirts, bomber jackets and fur.</p><p>And when mad clashing flower prints on T-shirts got thrown into the mix alongside baby-blue shaggy shearlings and jeans appliquéd with frayed patches spelling out the word VERSUS, Donatella brought in an optimism and energy that's very welcome right now, no matter what the decade. For evening, the dress code recalled another recognizable zone of Versace's celebratory universe. The black leather corset dresses inset with lace looked like a reworking of Gianni Versace's legendary sex-bomb designs from the heydays of the '90s.</p></div>"
111,fall,2002,f2002,viktor-rolf,"Viktor &amp; Rolf enigmatically named their collection ""long live the immaterial."" It was hard to decipher precisely what that meant since the collection was full of rather heavy materials—wool, pinstripes, fur, velvet, crochet. The designers' talent for earnest experimentalism with traditional elements was funneled into a single device this season; they highlighted all-black outfits with bits of vivid royal blue so that the epaulettes, collars, bib shirt fronts and belts popped out in radiant color.</p><p>The designers showed a bit of their playful side with jackets ornamented by absurdly-inflated cargo pockets. But otherwise, the collection had an almost disturbing degree of bourgeois propriety about it. Harlequin patterns of the sort normally seen on golf sweaters were blown up for patchwork fur and wool skirts and big mufflers. Paisley showed up on soft brown wool pants suits, and then in a stately blue velvet gown topped by an enormous coat with matching paisley lining.</p><p>Perhaps the show's title referred more to the backdrop—aerial photos of the Manhattan skyline at night, Texas oil fields, cotton fields, and traffic. For a charming, if unfathomable finale, the designers appeared in matching blue pajama suits while their disembodied heads floated among stars on the screens.</p></div>"
112,fall,2002,f2002,warren-noronha,"Sexy pinstripes may sound like a contradiction in terms, but that's Warren Noronha's contribution to the new interest in tailoring that is taking off in London. In a slick show on a mirrored runway, Noronha struck a blow for the much neglected pantsuit, recutting it without any of the uptight corporate connotations it’s attracted over the past decade.</p><p>Erin O'Connor set the tone when she strode out wearing a pinstripe bustier with a foulard flounce at the front and matching pants—not exactly career dressing, but drop-dead elegant from head to toe. Other versions had jackets, again with bias cutting falling in subtle folds in front. Noronha said he'd persuaded Savile Row tailors to get him the best menswear material to work with. ""I'm trying to make old things fashionable,"" he said. ""You can do anything if you cut it outrageously enough."" Noronha, an ex-assistant of Antonio Berardi, also believes in dresses. For this show, some were also done in pieced pinstripes, with corseted midsections, others in silk draped to fall in dippy asymmetrical hemlines. A kimono theme featuring ultrawide sleeves slightly overwhelmed some pieces but, in all, this was a collection that showed conviction and growing accomplishment.</p></div>"
113,fall,2002,f2002,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto's riffs on sport-meets-couture-meets-Japanese-asymmetry have lasted a couple of seasons now. But even though other designers have been coming up on the outside with zippy track suits, hoodies and parkas this season, Yohji is still out in front.</p><p>As is his wont, Yamamoto mixed street sport pieces with military drab, denim, knit, biker leathers and traditional suit and coat fabrics. He started out with trompe l'oeil biker jackets which were fused with skirts to look like coats, then cut up denim to layer over zipped sweats and long, elegant black pleated skirts. Oversized men's suits stumbled on the asexual side, but the designer's 20-year obsession with the formal structures of Western couture put him back on track. He cut tailcoats in khaki and worked graphic leather patches into black jackets and suits. A navy melton peacoat and a long coat cut with three-quarter-length puffed sleeves bordered on modernist Balenciaga.</p><p>Ultimately, this show was a bit of a marathon complete with some uphill moments. And when Yamamoto reached the finish line via parkas and nylon jackets with wings painted on the back, it wasn't certain whether he was conjuring heavenly seraphims or Hell's Angels. Either way, the audience cheered.</p></div>"
114,fall,2002,f2002,zac-posen,"How hot a ticket was Zac Posen's first independent show? Hot enough to get major models to walk the runway, Manolo Blahnik to do the shoes and first daughter Barbara Bush to sit in the front row. Even more impressively, the 21-year-old New Yorker lived up to the hype, delivering a strong, if not terribly commercial, message.</p><p>But then Posen is not aiming to be the next Ralph Lauren. His inspiration is '30s fashion—the sort of outfits Jean Harlow might have sported at a cocktail party. Pushing that notion of glamour to the extreme, Posen built his collection around dresses, mostly bias-cut with provocative necklines, which declared a fierce devotion to the female form. The designer incorporated '30s design elements like contrasting insets, fitted bodices, fluttering ruffles and fishtail trains, and used movie-star fabrics like satin and crepe, but also worked with cotton, leather and mesh. (While many of the looks were entrance-makers, there were also some quietly wearable pieces, like a blush mesh top and a long, mitred tweed coat.) And in a week of muted, monochrome palettes, Posen's 32 looks were a riot of color: orange, purple, blue and yellow, along with the occasional black and white.</p><p>The models, including Karen Elson, Eleonora Bose, Liberty Ross, Teresa Lourenco and the actress Paz de la Huerta, were clearly given a mandate to act up, and they did, vamping for the cameras like seasoned starlets.</p></div>"
1,spring,2003,s2003,a-f-vandevorst,"In the deconstructive ’90s, <em>glamour</em> was a dirty word. But now there is a real thrill to be had in watching a rising generation reclaim the term as their own. Few are doing it better than the Belgian husband-and-wife team An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, who sent out a stellar collection that took ’50s-flavored dressiness into exciting new territory.</p><p>A series of raincoats, in a range of colors from silver-and-white brocade to vivid red, shown with great cropped narrow pants and strappy silver heels, signaled A.F. Vandevorst’s intent to make grown-up clothes cool again. That goal only became more appealing as the couple displayed a sequence of knee-length dresses, some with sunburst-pleat skirts, others flowing toga-style over one shoulder. The elegance was in the deceptive simplicity; setting aside theoretical tendencies, they cut to the chase with something as easy as a silver Lurex tank worn over a white T-shirt dress and cinched with a chrome dragon belt.</p><p>After superb combinations of white with ecru chiffon in sheer blouses and aprons, the pair came up with a pink silk floral fabric—something between a ’50s evening brocade and an Indian sari—which they wrapped into bustiers and cut as a perfectly beautiful dress with twisted straps and a small flounce rippling to the hem. Now it's official: glamour is the new edge.</p></div>"
2,spring,2003,s2003,alberta-ferretti,"Snip! Snip! Snip! Scissors have been working overtime in Milan this season, and miles of redundant skirt fabric have hit the cutting-room floor. Even the perpetual romantic Alberta Ferretti caught the fever for shortening everything up to here.</p><p>She started with little shift dresses that had a distinct ’60s flavor, in colors like olive, buff, pale blue and silver, some woven through with strips of chiffon made to look like raffia. She then showed a group of tiny chiffon, ruched and puckered formfitting pieces, which were part ’50s swimsuit, part dress. Some of them came with minute flips of frill at the hem or with a matching pair of micro shorts—great clubwear for the cellulite-free under-25s. Ferretti thought of her more mature bohemian customers as well, though, sending out sheer embroidered skirts to wear over the body dresses for a modicum of modesty.</p></div>"
3,spring,2003,s2003,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell’Acqua plucks the trends from the Milanese air, musses them up and makes them appealing to a girl who likes her clothes on the skimpy side. His spring collection blended Italy’s current obsessions—utility clothing, satins and chiffons, chinoiserie, and a range of muted colors—with his personal affinity for lingerie touches.</p><p>The season's combat element showed up in a loose bottom garment that looked like a cross between jodhpurs and Zouave pants, tied somehow with drawstrings just below the knee. Dell’Acqua topped the style with chiffony flyaway pieces (including a sheer deconstructed cheongsam blouse) that blow open at every opportunity, showing plenty of flesh. Better ideas—for those of perfect leg, anyway—were vintagey lace-edged rose satin underwear converted into cute shorts and a coolly casual sage-green belted bush jacket with short shorts. When the same themes were sent out in somber black, however, it only served to underscore how the eye craves something prettier for summer.</p></div>"
4,spring,2003,s2003,alexander-mcqueen,"Alexander McQueen, showman, bad boy, where are you now? After joining Gucci Group and losing 30 pounds, the designer has shed his famously macabre show tactics. The most shocking things about his summer presentation were its stripped-down, old-fashioned romance and solid commercial appeal.</p><p>Against a giant screen projection of underwater scenes and <em>Blair Witch</em>–style haunted woods, McQueen unfolded a sartorial narrative that began with pirates and drowned maidens and ended in the rainforest. The odd journey took in brown leather corset vests and minis, worn with creamy chiffon ruffles, drapey knicker-length shorts, and Elizabethan doublets and ruffs. After a diversion into a largely redundant black sequence, McQueen burst out with prints and colors, and some major showstoppers in the form of floaty dresses in vibrant tie-dyes and jumpsuits in lime and electric blue. His crescendo was a rainbow-colored floor-sweeping gown with tulle ruffles and some spectacular boleros made of what looked like bird-of-paradise feathers.</p></div>"
5,spring,2003,s2003,alexandre-herchcovitch,"A sort of Brazilian Karl Lagerfeld, Alexandre Herchcovitch is a fashion superstar in his country of origin, where the prolific designer produces no fewer than four collections per season—his own signature label (which he also now shows in Paris), two jeanswear lines and a collection for the CORI company.</p><p>Herchcovitch is a consummate showman, and his presentations sometimes compete with the clothes for attention. For Spring, however, he was right on target, projecting colorful bull's-eyes onto the floor, which he intended to evoke ""the little waves produced when you drop a stone into a lake."" The designer's typically colorful collection incorporated a range of current trends, from ruffles and layering through beach and surf references (tie-dyes and bikinis). By far the most effective element, though, was Herchcovitch's take on active sportswear—especially his colorful athletic jackets and a lovely red drop-waisted dress of georgette silk with racing stripes. (The stripes, made of rainbow zippers developed exclusively for the designer by YKK, appeared throughout the show.)</p><p>Herchcovitch's easy command of color and cultures, and his irrepressible energy, are sure signs that his little waves will eventually break on far larger shores.</p></div>"
6,spring,2003,s2003,alice-roi,"As much as she’s a groovy downtown hipster, Alice Roi is entranced by the Watergate-era wasp wardrobe, with its proper proportions, clean lines and sporty allusions—somewhere between Tippi Hedren in <em>The Birds</em> and Sigourney Weaver in <em>The Ice Storm</em>.</p><p>Roi’s spring collection succeeded in bringing that demure esthetic firmly up to date. Her well-edited show included some brisk dresses and suits in low-key colors—grey, white, houndstooth check—cut from stiff fabrics that stood away from the body (a refreshing change in a week when most garments couldn’t get close enough to the female form). She showed sweetly sexy crocheted cardigans and dresses and some cozy, oversize velour hoodies. And after a rather abrupt group of shiny green and silver spandex bodysuits (scuba lessons at the country club, anyone?), the designer’s sexy little black cocktail dresses closed the evening on a high note.</p></div>"
7,spring,2003,s2003,ann-demeulemeester,"The most compelling designers working now are those who do so out of genuine personal conviction, and Ann Demeulemeester is certainly one of them. She has stayed true to her punk-out Patti Smith vision for 15 years, gathering many faithful followers along the way.</p><p>To fashion insiders, however, Demeulemeester's onward march seemed samey and relentless this season. Apart from some great silver leathers, the collection showed little awareness of mainstream trends—or even the idea of summer itself, which doesn't exactly cry out for black washed-leather biker coats and pants. Rebel-hearted fans, of course, won't have cared about that, preferring to zoom in on the messages on her T-shirts, which spelled out encouraging words like <em>life, sin</em> and <em>wilder.</em> And her fans should have been more than happy with the new Demeulemeester accessory, a dangling wraparound leather neck piece, which looked thrillingly like barbed wire.</p></div>"
8,spring,2003,s2003,anna-sui,"Whatever the current trends, count on Anna Sui to find the appropriate soundtrack. This season, it was the Ramones from beginning to end, providing a high-energy backdrop for her punchy spring collection.</p><p>Sui started out with kicky plaid pleated minis; hip-length, boxy, tight trousers trimmed in bright ribbon; and Carnaby Street-inspired striped shirts. She quickly moved out of the dance club and into the country club with a series of dresses, skirts, tops and jackets inspired by organized sports: piqué golf skirts embroidered with frogs, short white tennis dresses that mixed athletic mesh and lace, football jerseys shrunk for a more feminine fit, cropped baseball jackets, prepped-out sweaters and fuzzy cardigans. From there, she went fragile (though <em>Blitzkrieg Bop</em> continued to pound out of the speakers), closing the show with a series of lacy, neon-bright baby-doll dresses worn with clunky Frye boots. There were some cute, compelling pieces mixed into the outfits, like a ruffled floral windbreaker and some short silk floral dresses. But Sui's ability to translate street trends into great items was not as much in evidence as it has been in past seasons.</p></div>"
9,spring,2003,s2003,anne-klein,"Anne Klein designer Charles Nolan faces a tricky fashion dilemma: how to take a venerable, commercially powerful name and give it a new lease on life, without alienating a faithful clientele.</p><p>For spring, Nolan rose to the challenge by adding a touch of tough chic to the sportswear classics for which the label is known. Skintight trousers were paired with generous deerskin motorcycle jackets, while pencil skirts and short shorts came with neat cotton blouses or soft jersey tops. He kept the fabrics lightweight—parachute silk, crisp cotton, seersucker, taffeta—and the color palette predominantly white, khaki, toffee, gray and black, with shots of red and pink. The handkerchief-point hem has embedded itself deeply into spring's collections, and Nolan showed his own version, using striped fabrics in bias-cut skirts that just grazed the knee.</p><p>Sportswear is all about easy comfort, and, as far as Nolan is concerned, that notion extends to evening as well: He sent out tiny jersey dresses paved with coin-size paillettes and rhinestone-studded sweatshirts that were simultaneously soft and sparkly.</p></div>"
10,spring,2003,s2003,antonio-berardi,"Shrinking violets, seek your spring wardrobe elsewhere. The last thing Antonio Berardi's brazen young things want to do is melt into the background. With their wild tresses flowing and their skirts climbing ever skyward, these girls make tossing propriety to the wind an Olympic sport.</p><p>But it's all in good fun. Berardi designed his spring line in spun-sugar colors: lavender, pale yellow, sky blue and apricot, tempered with some ivory, white and black to keep the insulin levels in check. Using attention-grabbing fabrics like gleaming charmeuse and breezy gossamer silks, he cut skintight dresses, short-short skirts and pants tight enough for a rock star. Those trends have gotten plenty of airtime in the spring collections, though, and Berardi didn't bring much news to the table. Where he really shows his hand is with jackets: He cinches in the waists, blows out the shoulders to Thierry Mugler-esque proportions and piles on embellishments like beading or bits of lace. Berardi may not be the go-to guy for the working women of the world, but he'll always have the It girls.</p></div>"
11,spring,2003,s2003,badgley-mischka,"If the soundtrack of a show is any insight into a designer's state of mind, Badgley Mischka are feeling reflective. The duo, who've made their name by putting a modern spin on traditional glamour, opened their spring collection with Patti Smith's <em>Dancing Barefoot</em>, a beautiful but pensive ballad about letting go.</p><p>That mood translated into a toning down of Badgley Mischka's pile-it-on beads and baubles approach, making way instead for pastels, muted paisley prints, trailing handkerchief hems, whisper-light chiffons and lots of lace. There was also a new edge to the collection, by way of some short, flirty dresses and sexy blouses paired with skinny white pants. The models, with their mussed hair and mod clear-Lucite heels, looked softer and more approachable than last season's sirens.</p><p>That's not to say Badgley Mischka are stepping away from the sparkle and sex appeal that have made them famous—especially with another red carpet looming this Sunday at the Emmys. There were clingy, curvy, photo-op dresses aplenty (a good thing, with <em>Sex and the City</em>'s Kristin Davis in the front row). But with this collection, the designers definitely steered a new course by shedding some unnecessary glitz. And that's never a bad thing to let go of.</p></div>"
12,spring,2003,s2003,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière’s distillation of sport influences put Balenciaga far out in front of everyone else. Instead of scoring easy points by throwing in the inevitable track pant or tank, the designer used technical wizardry and intense research to transform surfing, diving and baseball references into streamlined city dressing.</p><p>Everything in his spring collection was body defining—cut short, sculpted to the torso and calculated to outline every curve—without losing sight of what the Balenciaga brand is all about: fantastic pants and jackets and distinctive decoration. Tiny dresses, seamed like scuba suits, had patched-in zones of bright Hawaiian surfer prints on the front or shoulder—a slick advance in Ghesquière’s exploration of collaged fabric. Other dresses were bound about with drapery that was stitched flat to the body. The crucial Balenciaga pant, which Ghesquière cut with a high waist for the past season, was this time done in stretch fabrics, shaped with complex seaming.</p><p>The standout look, certain to send copy artists into overdrive, was worn by Gisele Bündchen; the striped T-shirt with padded shoulders and ribbed skintight pants was about as un-literal a reference to baseball as you can imagine. When it comes to absorbing and recasting influences, Ghesquière is fashion’s champion left fielder, and that’s what puts him in a different league.</p></div>"
13,spring,2003,s2003,bcbg-max-azria,"BCBG Max Azria is based in Los Angeles, the city of eternal sunshine. And with his pretty, feminine spring collection, it seems the designer was doing his best to translate those blue skies and golden rays into clothing.</p><p>Fall's gloomy Goth looks have been banished in favor of Easter egg colors, skimpy dresses, A-line skirts and lingerie details, done in clingy lightweight fabrics like chiffon and silk jersey. Azria's silhouette follows the female form without stalking it, and he plays up the flirty aspects of his clothes by adding lacy trim; making deeply plunging necklines; and cutting dresses with layers of ruffly chiffon that swirl out at the knee.</p><p>There were a few smartly cut sportswear pieces, like a sharp chalk-white trench coat and a taupe pantsuit, to round out the collection. And, for those rare occasions when it gets chilly, Azria's short gold leather jacket will provide a little nighttime shine.</p></div>"
14,spring,2003,s2003,behnaz-sarafpour,"After her fall show, with its simple materials, pared-down shapes and erudite poetic references, Behnaz Sarafpour could easily have been labeled an egghead designer. But her expanded spring collection showed she's not looking to spend her Saturday nights in the library.</p><p>Yes, Sarafpour has an intellectual bent, demonstrated this time by a group of distinctly Japanese, crisp black-and-white wool minidresses that wrapped and tied intriguingly. But she also demonstrated a playful side, via canvas jeans, dresses and miniskirts hand-painted with chromatic bursts of color, and gold chain-link vests worn over washed silk separates (shades of Paco Rabanne). A couple of smartly cut canvas pieces with generous patch pockets traced their American sportswear heritage directly back to Bonnie Cashin.</p><p>She may not be a bookworm, but Sarafpour has clearly taken one famous motto to heart. With a mere 25 looks, her finely edited show left the smiling audience convinced that brevity is indeed the soul of wit.</p></div>"
15,spring,2003,s2003,betsey-johnson,"Betsey Johnson's spring 2003 collection was titled ""My Blue Heaven,"" but it could just as well have been called ""Infectious Enthusiasm."" For Johnson, festive dressing is an everyday affair, and <em>joie de vivre</em> a driving principle.</p><p>This season, though, there were a few changes in the routine: Johnson showed the collection on August 10 at her East Hampton home, as the centerpiece of a daylong party that also celebrated her 60th birthday and her company's 24th year in business. The poolside show featured some reworkings of her greatest hits: tight jersey dresses printed with big, cheerful cabbage roses, corset tops and candy-colored lacy tulle petticoats, as well as a few punkette slashed pieces for the bad girls. Everything was tight, sheer or micro-short—the bathing suits could have embarrassed a Brazilian—but under Johnson's guidance, good cheer overwhelmed any whiff of potential sluttiness.</p><p>Johnson claims she's hit a milestone in her life and that now is the time to step back and let daughter Lulu take over much of the daily business. Whether that really happens remains to be seen, but one thing is inevitable: Wherever she ends up, Johnson will be spreading the love.</p></div>"
16,spring,2003,s2003,bill-blass,"In his fourth season as creative head at the house of Bill Blass, Lars Nilsson has established a few of his favorite things. The Swedish-born, Paris-trained designer loves folklore-inspired patterns, handcrafted details and—in an industry that consistently returns to black—vivid color. Part of the challenge for him at Blass is to incorporate these elements into the label’s tradition of sparely elegant sportswear.</p><p>There were moments when Nilsson achieved just the right balance: a bold chevron sweater, a creamy silk taffeta shirtdress, a simple white shirt paired with an A-line skirt embroidered in heavy silver bars. He used whispery silk seersucker to make pretty blouses and a pouf-sleeve shirtdress that will look great rippling in the spring breezes. But some of the looks he sent out, like a hip-length navy pinstripe blazer with emphatic shoulders, or elephant-leg trousers, seemed out of step in a season where pants are cut lean and jackets are generally short and swingy.</p><p>There’s no question, though, that Nilsson knows how to delight the eye: He closed his show with a torrent of tropical-toned evening wear, from flamingo pink to hibiscus red, that's sure to have all his customers yearning for their summer vacations</p></div>"
17,spring,2003,s2003,blaak,"Blaak, the <em>nom de mode</em> of Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif, is a label that has established its identity by creating accessible, on-trend streetwear. This season, following the prevailing currents, the designers have moved from peasant remixes to a sporty ’80s approach full of references to the first great London fashion boom, circa 1984, when Katharine Hamnett and Body Map ruled the runways with their combat and dancewear clothes.</p><p>The designers played the trend with a collection of white and neutral tones punched up with metallic and neon touches, all done in washed cotton, mesh, satin and leather. Add in a lot of layering—tank tops under bombers, skirts over pants—plus cutaway, casual shapes, and you get the general picture.</p><p>Blaak’s best pieces are the elastic-waist bombers and vests that curve in back, tracksuit style. And the perforated white leather with solid banding on the seams was a snappy offering for summer’s fashion workout.</p></div>"
18,spring,2003,s2003,boudicca,"Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. Their Boudicca presentations are symbolic, troubling experiences, drawn from sources so deep inside their heads there ought to be a handbook with footnotes. But then again, who needs explanations? Even at the far reaches of the avant-garde, fashion isn’t—or shouldn’t be—that complicated.</p><p>Boudicca’s Spring spectacle left viewers groping for meaning once again. The stage was set with a black-painted skeleton, a stuffed black swan, bowls of black-painted apples and digital clocks that the models punched into action as they passed, in the same clothes, over and over again. It was surreal, painfully slow and much like being trapped in a looping dream—exactly the vibe the designers intended.</p><p>Did the clothes mitigate the torture-by-conceptualism? Almost. There were beautiful asymmetric jersey dresses as well as elegant one-sleeved taffeta gowns. A normal woman could wear these statuesque, graceful clothes without being an involuntary walking art manifesto. In the end, it’s as simple as that.</p></div>"
19,spring,2003,s2003,burberry-prorsum,"Thirty-year-old Christopher Bailey is the designer charged with inventing a convincing identity for Burberry Prorsum—and solving the riddle of how to make that legendary plaid cool again. Now in his third season, he’s finding his stride, contributing a young, casual British feel to the collection without losing sight of the need to appeal to a sophisticated international audience.</p><p>Bailey picked up on the military/sport theme that has surfaced on so many other runways for spring, but managed to make something quirkily different of it. He matched cashmere jog pants and knickers, as well as leather biker pants, with sporty jackets—some made in mesh—and showed a macintosh, the mainstay of the house, in dark-green canvas with exposed zippers—a neat compromise between quality and cool. Against this solid background came a few injections of personality, like ’60s-inspired checkerboard patterns on sweaters and a light version of a college scarf, shot through with a bright lamé stripe. The new Burberry check, meanwhile, came scaled up, in soft green, on a shrunken jacket that had been distressed to look like a favorite personal piece. It worked.</p></div>"
20,spring,2003,s2003,cacharel,"Under the direction of British design team Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro, Cacharel has become a cheerful playground of zippy, youthful ideas. While the line might not make the earth move for a serious fashionista, its rediscovered verve produces at least one respectable, commercially viable idea per season.</p><p>For pring, Clements and Ribeiro combined elements of Carnaby Street, the San Fernando Valley circa 1983, and sunny St. Tropez. They showed oversized jersey tops and dresses; short skirts and overalls with bold floral appliqués; shrunken polo shirts, sometimes with crisp, skinny pants; and tiny chiffon tops and dresses. Not so different from other collections this season, except that the duo gave those pieces a blast of energy with giddy patterns and bracing colors—big tomato-red stripes, dizzy polka dots, soft madras plaids and paisleys, and gentle cherry blossom prints. Though there was the potential for mayhem, the overall effect was of happy chatter rather than chaotic shouting. And in a season when the main message is straight-out seduction, Cacharel's teenage innocence felt like a fresh breeze.</p></div>"
21,spring,2003,s2003,calvin-klein-collection,"Calvin Klein’s collections can have a hypnotic effect. Avoiding bells and whistles, he sends out utterly simple clothes that, through cut, color and drape, lull the watchers—who this season included Sandra Bullock and Gwyneth Paltrow—into a willing state of desire.</p><p>The designer’s darkly monastic fall collection, with its military overtones, is a thing of the past. Using a palette of teal blue, ivory, taupe, shell pink, white and black, he sent out a spring line that was as gentle as a sea breeze on a summer day. Luxury fabrics—supple viscose, fluid silk charmeuse, crisp linen, buttery glove leather and sheer chiffon—took the tailoring into a new realm and emphasized Klein’s command of understated sex appeal. (This is a designer who can turn a humble basic like a tank top or a knit camisole into a seductive tool, just by placing the neckline precisely so it strokes the model’s collarbone.) A more overt sexiness was also in evidence, via bra tops and corsets paired with severe tailored trousers, skinny low-slung skirts and tight black jersey dresses. The sportswear front was equally well represented, with crisp shirts and shirtdresses, oversize leather jackets with quilted or channel-stitched collars, and a sweeping suede camel trench. Klein ended the show, like a good day at the beach, with a feast of sweets: pretty, pastel dresses detailed with sunbursts of pintucking or bands of ruching, and a generous serving of vanilla-colored silk jersey dresses replete with cascading ruffles.</p></div>"
22,spring,2003,s2003,carolina-herrera,"In a testament to Carolina Herrera’s finely tuned sense of balance, her spring show contained equal measures of youthful nerve and sophisticated maturity.</p><p>Though Herrera's clothes never scream ""trendy,"" she knows how to drop in an up-to-the-minute reference to keep things fresh. With workwear all the rage, she added subtle details like D-rings and tab pockets and showed a slim-cut safari jacket atop a fluttery paisley chiffon skirt. Charmeuse is turning up on a lot of runways; Herrera used it sparingly but to good effect in long, cool dresses of vivid green and aquatic blue. Her butter-soft pink leather suit, with its knee-length skirt and patch pockets piped in brown, was luxuriously proper without being hard-edged. Elsewhere, the designer added romantic volume to her curve-hugging jersey dresses with a classic poet's sleeve, cut on an angle. And she gave that standard voluminous ball skirt a frisky new attitude simply by sitting it on the model's hips and pairing it with a crisp, sheer organza top.</p></div>"
23,spring,2003,s2003,celine,"Runway collections do many things: showcase intellectual experiments, play out designers' obsessions, display ideas for photographs—sometimes even present clothes that women might wear. The last on the list is, curiously, the rarest sighting of all. But Michael Kors certainly hasn't forgotten it at Celine. He turned in a spring collection that could actually come under the heading of true ready-to-wear—in the way an average person might understand it.</p><p>Kors brought a splash of ethnic color and handwork from India, added a sprinkling of the '60s, a soupçon of military, and rooted it all in uncomplicated clothing. You want something to get about town in? You're—dare we mention it—going to work? And you're taking a holiday at some point? In his methodical American way, Kors checked off all the boxes for spring and summer, lending just enough trend to keep the clothes current.</p><p>It was a tricky feat, and he handled it by choosing a vibrant palette of hot pink and orange against white, green and spice colors. Indian-influenced materials brought in shine and luxury via silver-embroidered duchesse satin, made into coats, pencil skirts and skinny pants. He toned it down for citywear, using floppy crinkled cotton for light trenches and little jackets and studded suede for slim skirts. Kors went on a bit too long with the swim and psychedelic-print beach pieces, but the collection was a statement of commerciality so unusual as to seem almost…brave.</p></div>"
24,spring,2003,s2003,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan joined a band for the night. He stood next to a five-piece avant-garde combo called the Brood, picked up a red Fender and plucked away on a single chord during his show. The significance of it all was, as always, an unexplained Chalayan-esque puzzle. Did it have something to do with the fact that the clothes he put out were shorter, stretchier and more colorful than before? Not really. Though his layered jersey dresses came with complex cutouts and bottom-hugging miniskirts, the collection didn't rock 'n' roll.</p><p>For spring, the designer revisited his obsession with construction and deconstruction; the clothes were shredded and cut away to expose layers of fabric and outline zones of flesh. Ironically, though, Chalayan is at his best when he veers away from academic complexity and his design emerges as recognizable garments and trends. The pieces he executed in drapey black—the shirt with wide armholes paired with a wrapped-waist skirt and the halter vest over pants—were beautifully cut and ready to be worn anywhere. There were exquisite layers of diaphanous pleats in a beige dress and fluted tunic, and there were a few pieces in lingerie pink and dusty greens that related to current fashion. As to what it all ""meant""—that's a mystery likely to remain locked up in Chalayan's head.</p></div>"
25,spring,2003,s2003,chloe,"Chloé designer Phoebe Philo understands the first law of provocation: never act like you're trying too hard. For spring, she trod a long-legged, high-heeled path through a collection that turned on the sex appeal without resorting to trashiness.</p><p>Philo also knows how to undercut the polished taste of a French house, via a smart young woman's way of putting things together. She used conventionally proper materials like navy chiffon, pale suede, black satin and a Spanish-influenced print to make little dresses with a lot of impact. Some were decorated with silver bobbles, to shiver as the wearer walks, others prettily embellished with brass flowers. Instead of being tartily clinging and revealing, Philo's tops were fluted and flew open at the neckline in a subtly undone way. She handled the obligatory leg-show with cuffed shorts and with low-slung skirts in gauzy fabrics, while the signature Chloé swimwear came in dressed-up two-pieces, tied around the body with beaded strings and trailing flirty little scarves.</p><p>Feminine and coolly accessorized with matching bags, this was a collection cleverly calculated to make men want to tear the clothes off a girl—in the nicest possible way, of course.</p></div>"
26,spring,2003,s2003,christian-dior,"The method to John Galliano’s Dior madness is no longer in debate. The designer has re-branded the legendary Parisian house via high-octane couture shows that broach the wilder shores of creativity and are then filtered down to instantly recognizable ready-to-wear pieces for Christian Dior addicts.</p><p>Galliano’s spring show stayed true to his now well-established formula, as slinky cargo pants, fanny-hugging mini parachute dresses with voluminous tops, Hollywood-showgirl frocks and amped-up bikinis rolled effortlessly off the production line. He displayed accessible versions of the gargantuan leather jackets, strap-bound leather tubes and plunging goddess dresses that appeared in his July couture show, sending a current of new fluorescents, khakis and metallics down the runway.</p><p>There were some pulse-racing moments—the loud little Dior-printed dresses and a sexy gold bikini with a touch of screen-siren ruching in the bra—and some change in direction, as ethnic references were discarded in favor of all-out glamour. But there is now a sense of familiarity to this process and a feeling that Galliano’s poetry is getting lost in the machine.</p></div>"
27,spring,2003,s2003,christian-lacroix,"Fifteen years after his house was founded, Christian Lacroix continues to earn accolades and to add new strings to his bow. Appointed only months ago as creative director at Emilio Pucci, he was named last week as a chevalier in France's Legion of Honor.</p><p>In lieu of a pring show at the Carousel du Louvre, Lacroix scaled back and showed pieces from his signature jeans and Bazar lines, as well as some of his vintage couture designs, at an intimate dinner. All his signatures were in evidence: corsets, ethnic prints and metallic leathers, all joyously layered, many featuring embroidery and beading and worn with outsized jewelry and stunning gold warrior sandals.</p><p>At times, the styling—masks for the models, socks worn with evening shoes, bathing suits peeking out from under denim jeans—seemed at odds with the classic creations on view. Still, anything that helps reposition Lacroix as a versatile modern master, as opposed to the producer of the pouf skirt, is to be commended.</p></div>"
28,spring,2003,s2003,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo, undisputed high priestess of the avant-garde, has an unpredictable, ahead-of-the-pack mind-set that lends her shows a must-see quality. For spring, she set herself a new challenge: to decorate her clothes without using any external embellishments. She extended the fabric of her cotton garments by yards, tying and braiding the extra cloth to form bunchy plaits and rosettes, and the project resulted in a bulky silhouette constructed of boleros, long skirts and tunics festooned with outcrops of chunky 3-D effects. It made for one of Comme des Garçons’ more theoretical collections, which die-hard Kawakubo fans will no doubt wear as an act of art appreciation.</p><p>The designer is not completely disconnected, though, from mainstream seasonal thinking. She experimented with intense color and produced an amazing combination of fuchsia and candy pink among the olives, whites and black. And there at the center of it all was the cargo pant—the summer trend <em>sans frontière.</em></p></div>"
29,spring,2003,s2003,costume-national,"If fashion designers were each assigned a signature car, Costume National’s Ennio Capasa would undoubtedly end up with a sleek, dark Ferrari. Capasa strips trends down to their essential elements without taking away the slick sex appeal, and the result for spring was a collection with both visual and commercial clout.</p><p>The predominantly black palette was a bit heavy for a spring show, although it was leavened with white, gray, and occasional bits of apricot and mauve or beading and embroidery. Capasa kept it skinny (tight pants, slim skirts), mini (the briefest dresses, skirts and shorts) and bare (lots of spaghetti straps and sheer chiffon, including some tops worn over puzzling strappy bondage pieces reminiscent of Helmut Lang). It wasn't a groundbreaking show, but there was plenty to appeal to that trend-hungry customer who wants her clothes to look as cutting edge as she is.</p></div>"
30,spring,2003,s2003,d-g,"After a jaunty trek through the Tyrol for their fall D&amp;G collection, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana took the secondary line back to familiar territory—sunny southern Italy—for spring. The show combined local pride, classical references and modern moxie, all bound together with a healthy dose of sex appeal.</p><p>Touristy T-shirts printed with various Rome-related slogans and the D&amp;G logo were a mainstay of the line. But in the hands of the designers, what could have been airport souvenir fare was morphed into fashion: slashed, cropped and shredded to within an inch of <em>Flashdance</em>. The pieces appeared alone as very mini dresses, or came paired with baseball jackets cropped bust-high, vividly colored sheer chiffon ponchos and shredded tight jeans. Other looks on offer included tiny bras and loose, drapy silk tops, combat microshorts and ruffly minis. There were glamorous oversize glasses and gold baseball caps to ward off those intense Mediterranean midday rays and, for strolling around town, what must surely be the season's cheeriest footwear: sneakers on built-up rainbow platform soles worthy of '70s funkster George Clinton.</p></div>"
31,spring,2003,s2003,diane-von-furstenberg,"Diane Von Furstenberg got her start as a working woman's designer. Granted, with her aristocratic European pedigree, she wasn't exactly punching a clock. But those just-feminine-enough jersey wrap dresses were a godsend for fashionable career women fed up with the rules of <em>Dress for Success</em>.</p><p>Thirty years later, DVF—now with the help of creative director Nathan Jenden—is outfitting a new generation, for whom things have loosened up a bit. Her career-minded customer still wants work-friendly clothes, but she wants them to have some spirit, too. And she'd also like a couple of sexy party dresses or a silky, skin-baring blouse for her equally hectic after-hours activities. Von Furstenberg, intent on keeping her loyal customers satisfied, aims to meet all those needs and then some with her expanding collection. This season, she dropped some of the eccentric cuts and brash color schemes of her fall show, softened her silhouettes and mixed in plenty of pretty prints and floaty chiffons. The line ran from sweet, sheer bias-cut dance dresses to sexy, tight pinstripe suits and sporty denim pieces.</p><p>It was a lot to take in—but then again, women's lives have gotten a lot busier over the last three decades. And if there were any doubts about DVF's appeal to the modern working woman, the hearty applause from her power-heavy front row—Diane Sawyer, Ellen Barkin, Julianne Moore, Candace Bushnell, Natasha Richardson, Bianca Jagger—should lay them to rest. Right next to the shoulder pads.</p></div>"
32,spring,2003,s2003,dkny,"Donna Karan's DKNY shows are like flash dispatches from the trend trenches. Flippy pleated minis! Retro-tinged dresses! Cargo capri pants! Short shorts and pencil skirts! Mixed and matched by Karan's inimitable hand, they zing by in her high-energy shows.</p><p>Karan laid out the basic components of her spring vision with her opening group, done in giddy bubblegum pink: a balmacaan raincoat over a polka-dot top; a soft sweater worn with a full skirt; and a lightweight jacket worn over short shorts. From there, she added in a few retro-spirited dresses, like a loose-cut navy polka-dot chiffon shift worn over cropped trousers, in the style of the new mod girls. Skirts are Karan’s new favorite item, and she showed plenty: knee-length pleated versions, mood-altering minis with pep to spare, slim pencils that sat low on the hip. And since jackets are always important to Karan's stylish working customer, she threw in a few variations on that theme: curvy fitted styles, boxy denim versions and cropped bombers.</p></div>"
33,spring,2003,s2003,dolce-gabbana,"The glamazons were out in force at Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Eva Herzigova, Naomi Campbell, Amber Valletta, Stephanie Seymour and Gisele Bündchen blasted into the room, walking proof that power-womanhood is not extinct on planet Fashion. And what do these ultra-women wear? Dolce &amp; Gabbana—who are at their best when turning women into stars. This season's collection laid out the full repertoire.</p><p>The list of influences is rather disparate—astronauts, Paco Rabanne, Sid Vicious, sailors and ancient Rome. Don’t worry too much about how all that hangs together. They were merely the channels for the line's enduring themes: curvaceous dresses, hourglass suits, masculine and feminine tailoring, amazing embellished coats and jeans.</p><p>The punk idea brought out S&amp;M crisscross lacing in the satin corseted dresses, straps and buckles on trousers, a new oversize jacket in the house's signature mannish suits, and heavy studwork on leather jackets and bags. Space-age was a way to work silver (Milan’s current favorite) as zippered foil coats, jackets and pants, while M. Rabanne got a nod by way of jackets made from bands of chinchilla and chain mail. The most uplifting moment, though, was the sight of Ms. Seymour in a shirred, black jersey dress, looking like an ’80s-era sex-on-legs goddess. It was just like old times, in more ways than one. The dress turned out to be Dolce &amp; Gabbana’s own—vintage.</p></div>"
34,spring,2003,s2003,donna-karan,"After several seasons spent voyaging inward, Donna Karan is clearly in the mood to go out and get down. Her New Age woman has left the ashram and is now on the hunt for a cold beer and some hot jazz.</p><p>Karan opened with a series of very businesslike jackets and coats whose built-up shoulders, brass buttons and stitching details recalled the exaggerated power-woman suits of the ’40s. But she quickly softened the mood with pretty jersey wrap dresses bound with generous sashes and knee-length skirts that either hugged the body or swirled out in circles. While most of the collection stuck to black, cream, navy and nude, Karan threw in some bold prints and bright colors—she even called one her ""celebration print""—to spice things up. Her eyelet pieces, in poppy-red or blue on a cream background, were perfect for spring.</p><p>Karan's customer is bound to be tired after a day in the boardroom and a night at the club, but this is not a woman who wears sweats around the house. She'll wrap herself up in the sweeping black-and-white satin kimono that the designer used to close the show, before she drifts off to dream of the next day’s festivities</p></div>"
35,spring,2003,s2003,dries-van-noten,"Hello, glamazons; farewell, luxe nomads. The spring shows have made it very clear that the international bohemian has, for the most part, taken down her yurt and switched over to a steady diet of cargo pants and satin dresses. That could spell trouble for a designer like Dries Van Noten, whose stock in trade—pretty, ethnic-inspired dresses and tops, gently generous silhouettes, and unique colors—was perfect for the haute hippie trend.</p><p>But just because the fashion caravan has moved on, that doesn't mean Van Noten will. He has a loyal customer, and this collection will provide her with an ample spring wardrobe. The designer showed plenty of his signature full, stripy skirts paired with limp knit tank tops, and he gave a quick nod to current styles in the form of satin tank tops, a few cropped blouson jackets and some pretty chiffon dresses. Where he really let fly, though, was in his masterful, inventive color palette. Any designer who can put together combinations like turquoise and brown, wine and orange, or lemon and apricot (to name just a few) is clearly capable of setting his own itinerary.</p></div>"
36,spring,2003,s2003,eley-kishimoto,"The husband-and-wife team of Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto has gathered a cult following for their charming, vaguely retro sensibility and their way with prints. In Eley Kishimoto’s world, life is the endless summer afternoon of an unsophisticated girlhood, a picture conjured by a warm nostalgia for an idea of cozy English domesticity circa 1950.</p><p>For next summer, the Eley Kishimoto ingenue will go about her errands in cotton pinafores with piping, sweet dresses in picnic checks, ginghams and polka dots, and skirts patterned with bold, loopy ’50s prints. When she goes to the seaside, she’ll have a cute cotton bikini with a frilled bottom, and if it rains, there are lots of nice raincoats to wear. For all occasions, there are lovely printed sneakers and flats shoes, to put a colorful spring in her step.</p></div>"
37,spring,2003,s2003,emanuel-ungaro,"Where does a ruffle-loving designer go when tight pants are on the season's screen? España, naturally, with its flamenco frills and matador pants. Emanuel Ungaro designer Giambattista Valli made it his destination for a spring fiesta of femininity, which reveled in lavish color, prints and a sexy, leggy silhouette.</p><p>The collection included just about everything a woman might need for endless hot summer nights. There were short one-shoulder and strapless dresses, in coral and mixed polka dots and florals, for a youthful cocktail. For serious seduction, there were gowns with deep plunges and high slits, and a lineup of super-beaded sparklers for the big event. It all could have sunk in a veritable Niagara of waterfall ruffles, but Valli's increasing confidence kept it afloat.</p><p>His knack is adding a few shots of playful cool to the mix. Well-tailored matador pants got a dash of punk with zipped ankles and the odd strap and D-ring, and some of the cropped jackets were slightly urban-biker. Nicely handled color clashes, gutsy scarab bags and a general air of undone spontaneity gave Ungaro's Spanish the right kind of accent for the moment.</p></div>"
38,spring,2003,s2003,emilio-pucci,"The glorious heritage of Emilio Pucci—all those fabulous, swirly psychedelic prints—has been crying out for a genetic match with a designer who can give it new life. And who better than Christian Lacroix, a man who has color, pattern and a sense of the sunny Mediterranean imprinted on his very soul?</p><p>Lacroix has taken his first season in the Pucci hot seat very seriously but with a light heart. There are few designers as accomplished with bold color as he, and this collection showed his skills. He put purple with brown and pistachio, mixed coral and turquoise with yellow, and printed the patterns on floaty chiffons and the house's signature slinky jersey. His harem pants, one-shoulder goddess tunics over leggings, and dresses that trailed handkerchief points all keyed into a Technicolor fantasy of an endless summer pool party. That should go down just beautifully in Saint-Tropez, St. Bart’s, Ibiza and the like. City dwellers craving a slice of the dream found something, too: a few mad, bright tracksuits, a pair of classic Pucci capri pants and a fantastic purple-and-green satiny-cotton trench, which will defy the misery of any rainy day.</p></div>"
39,spring,2003,s2003,emma-cook,"Emma Cook’s Spring collection, her first official solo catwalk show, played like the ’60s as seen by a child of the ’80s. The 26-year-old designed her presentation around an imaginary woman named Suzistyrene, a character she dreamed up after watching <em>Barbarella</em> and doing some thinking about ’80s sportswear. Suzi, it turns out, has charm and individual style to spare.</p><p>Cook worked ’60s themes—clear plastic inserts in shift dresses, shiny PVC and patchwork suede—alongside ’80s elements like jersey with shoulder cutouts, and straps and buckles reminiscent of Duran Duran. PVC raincoats with Liberty-style prints and suede overalls and dresses, meanwhile, had more than a whiff of Mary Quant and Jean Muir about them. Cook also referenced Paco Rabanne, via overdresses and neck pieces made of linked plastic circles and butterflies, but without getting heavy-handed or pretentious. All of which made for a lighthearted debut and a welcome breath of fresh air.</p></div>"
40,spring,2003,s2003,emporio-armani,"Emporio Armani may be the younger, second line in the universe of Giorgio Armani, but that doesn’t mean its presentation gets short shrift from the designer. He shepherds his audience to his monumental, gray Tadao Ando-designed auditorium, closes the vast iron doors behind them, and lifts the curtain on a lavish theatrical production that springs from his fantasy.</p><p>This time the script was a Cuban-flavored travelogue, played out by models in berets, some flicking unlit Havana cigars. They roamed a central stage, while behind them a huge screen showed a film of two Armani-clad gamines at play. The clothes picked up on the urban-revolutionary theme but translated in a light, sunshiny Italian way. The season's military trend was filtered into bombers, parkas and combat pants in aquas, teals and dusty browns, done in floppy, breezy fabrics for nonaggressive civilians.</p><p>Armani continued the motif of the gathered-ankle pant from his main line's collection last season via cropped combat trousers, and he used drawstrings to give interest to jackets and tops. For nighttime, he turned to sheer, black, mesh bush vests sprinkled with diamanté; then he closed with sparkly, swingy dresses in hot fuchsia and red.</p></div>"
41,spring,2003,s2003,fendi,"To enter the arena of Italian fashion is to take a ringside seat at a gladiatorial contest between luxury brands. That, at least, seemed to be the impression Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi were intent on creating as they sent out a posse of glam warrior girls, dressed for battle in skimpy body-skimming chiffons and leathers, and armed to the hilt with killer accessories.</p><p>Lagerfeld opened with dark-blue two-piece swimwear, lashed together with strips that crisscrossed the body and paired with high—<em>very</em> high—Roman sandals in metallic leather. Everything he showed from then on emphasized the honed body, whether in light, tightly seamed tailoring, sheer, lacy knits or short, asymmetrical goddess dresses finished with matte silver sequins. The combat theme extended through cutout-metal armlets, chokers and even filigree-encrusted sunglasses.</p><p>Spring’s major assault, though, came in the shape of the Biga, a soft, exotic shoulder bag named after a Roman chariot. The gold-and-silver-mesh version, studded with Swarovski crystal, together with a rich-looking leather style embossed to look like feathers, seem primed to emerge victors in the next round of the epic 21st-century handbag wars.</p></div>"
42,spring,2003,s2003,frostfrench,"FrostFrench is the playful brainchild of actress Sadie Frost and her partner Jemima French. <em>Child</em> is very much the operative word here, since Frost coproduced the collection while pregnant with her fourth child—and produced him four days before the show.</p><p>And the lighthearted event, staged in an outdoor amphitheater in Regent’s Park, had all the atmosphere of a family picnic organized by groovy mommies, the kind who pick girl-rock music (Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon, Annabella Lwin) and still want to wear sexy, flirty clothes.</p><p>This wasn’t a collection touting domestic goddesses or old-time feminist style, though. <em>Empowered to flirt</em> is more FrostFrench’s approach—not surprising considering they started as a cheeky underwear label, a fact the audience was reminded of when some of the models flipped their skirts and wiggled their satin-clad behinds. The label has evolved, of course, and now produces pretty clothes like lace tops and dresses, provocative dungarees cut to define long legs, ’70s-style jeans with topstitched seams, terrycloth hoodies, and plenty of floaty, printed chiffon dresses, secured at the waist with chain belts dangling plastic hearts. The designers, refreshingly, thought of all the stages of a fashionable young woman’s life, from the short shorts of youth to the stylish togs of modern motherhood—including that hot new accessory, the FrostFrench baby sling.</p></div>"
43,spring,2003,s2003,gianfranco-ferre,"Gianfranco Ferré is a serious designer who cares about ""old-school"" ideas like cool elegance and perfect tailoring. In a season full of giddy, color-saturated fashion seemingly inspired by <em>animé</em> characters, his collection stood out for its restrained, mature focus.</p><p>Ferré kept his color palette subdued (chocolate brown, tobacco, charcoal and ivory with judiciously placed blasts of yellow and scarlet) and his silhouettes fairly traditional. Skirts came near the knee, trousers were fluid and jackets cut loose, but not gigantic. In a nod to current trends, the designer showed a lemon-yellow bomber jacket, a few cargo pockets and plenty of chiffon. But Ferré’s own innovation comes via cut and proportion; he can make a fitted jacket look fresh just by tweaking the collar-span-to-waistline ratio. A longtime admirer of Japanese technique, he also worked Asian motifs like block prints, narrow-cut kimono sleeves slashed to expose the arms, obi-wrapped midriffs and asymmetrical cuts into the line.</p><p>Not everything was about cool intellect, though; there were skimpy lingerie dresses, whispery sheer blouses slipping off shoulders and loose silk jackets swinging open to flash some skin. And a group of liquid silk charmeuse dresses finished off the show with a blast of heat that sent the mercury skyrocketing.</p></div>"
44,spring,2003,s2003,gibo,"Julie Verhoeven is a London illustrator and freelance designer whose kooky talent has been bubbling behind the fashion scene for a decade. She’s done stints with John Galliano and Martine Sitbon, and was brought in two seasons ago by Marc Jacobs to design the cute, nutty patchwork animal bags for Louis Vuitton.</p><p>Now, with the backing of the giant Italian manufacturer Gibo, Verhoeven has been thrust into the limelight with her own collection. At 33, she’s a child of the ’80s, and the girl she sent out is the personification of the teen who came of age listening to Yaz and Culture Club. She paraded two-tone graphics and clashing color–blocked outfits, frilly blouses, rah-rah skirts and conical-heel pumps. The collection is self-consciously clunky—clothes for a girl making a desperate stab at being glam for her first foray to a disco, only to spend the evening blushing in the corner. Haven’t we all been there?</p><p>Gibo has serious plans for Verhoeven’s designs, including opening a store here next January. Franco Penne, who heads up the company, said he chose a Londoner to create this collection because “Milan is about business, but London, whether it is up or down, is about creativity.”</p></div>"
45,spring,2003,s2003,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani is one of the few living designers who still care to address the needs of a professional woman in search of a suit. For spring, he applied himself to softening up the staple in a variety of ways. A gray suit was given a younger feel with the addition of a hip, stripy underpiece, while pants became more casual via elastic waists or drawstring details at the ankle. More surprising—especially for the man who pioneered androgynous ease in women’s tailoring—was his latest suggestion for a skirt to put under a jacket: a tight, sexy knee-length pencil in satin.</p><p>Armani's eveningwear attracts a big following as well—and the reason was lined up in the front row of his show, where celebrities Kim Cattrall, Tina Turner and Sophia Loren were scanning the runway for red-carpet suggestions. The designer offered them a huge range of possibilities, made of subtle Italian fabrics, often with an Oriental flavor to the cut and color. From long skirts paired with tiny, supple leather jackets right through to strapless and beaded gowns, the best moments were the simple ones. The standout? A dramatic body-skimming floor-length column in caf¿ au lait jersey.</p></div>"
46,spring,2003,s2003,givenchy,"For Givenchy, Julien Macdonald surfed several of the trend waves that are crashing on the fashion beach for summer. That meant Mediterranean-style versions of the season's ultra-short, sporty and combat-inspired looks, and hot doses of color.</p><p>Ignoring the house's former reputation for elegant, ladylike suits, Macdonald cut a white piqué jacket with matching micro shorts and paired a classic black jacket with sheer mesh trousers. His focus then turned mostly on resort clothes aimed at those who vacation in places like Saint-Tropez—and whose idea of fashion is to accessorize their hot-pink swimwear with a see-through sport jacket. Rounding out the casually dressy options were shredded lavender denims, and suede jackets and jeans done in vivid jungle-pattern patchwork. For evening, Macdonald channeled the current feeling for goddessy dresses and prints. His best: a black plissé-silk dress with a black empire waistband.</p></div>"
47,spring,2003,s2003,gucci,"The Gucci girl’s got legs—long, tan, flawless ones striding along on silver peep-toe sling-back pumps. Follow them all the way up, and around two weeks later, they eventually meet the hem of the minutest piece of clothing that was ever called a skirt or dress. For spring, in a word, Tom Ford says <em>short.</em></p><p>Using lustrous fabrics in subtle makeup colors from blush to tawny brown, pearly gray and silver, Ford draped and wrapped his gorgeous girls in clothes that navigated that dangerous Gucci line between innovation and vulgarity. The tousled hair, the jackets and tops poised to fall off shoulders—the whole presentation stirred sensations that fashion hasn’t felt since the last days of the great supermodels.</p><p>Still, don’t think tacky. Ford’s obsession now is integrating fine workmanship into abbreviated silhouettes. He took the idea of a kimono and portrayed it first as a simple silk beach cover-up, then as an elegant formfitting dress, painstakingly made from hand-painted strips of silk. He brought couture finesse to racer-back feathered dresses with the merest flip of a skirt. And with lightest touch, he wove white and rose gold into fragile ribbons to tie around wrists—the most modern-looking jewelry in Milan. When Carmen Kass closed the show in a dress made entirely of the same precious ribbon, it was a confident statement in the power of glamour. And fashion needs that.</p></div>"
48,spring,2003,s2003,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow’s collection fulfilled all the promise of innovation and thrill that visitors to London hope for. In a concise and beautifully conceived show, he managed to combine a feeling for real sportswear, a sense of glamour, fantastic juxtapositions of color and—rarest of all—truly original cutting.</p><p>The first outfit consisted of a jacket made of beige mackintosh fabric with raised inside-out seaming, its futuristic cut softened by an explosion of scallop-edged embroidered fabric at the front. He sustained that level of delight and surprise with glamorous pale bronze and purple satin dresses in loose, sporty cuts; interesting wrapped tailoring; and witty elements, like Lurex tank tops and neck pieces of huge, chunky crystal. One sparkling highlight was a heavily beaded T-shirt paired with lime-green running shorts.</p><p>Morrow’s confident touch even managed to turn the subject of bright, shiny prints—often used ironically on the London runways—into something that looked like a chic, avant-garde proposition. Tempered by his cool tailoring, the foil-Jacquard bombers and tailored jackets came across as wholly desirable, a leap of imagination rather than the usual tongue-in-cheek ’80s reference.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""xs5ou3v""></div></div><p>Up to now, Morrow’s experimental shows have been confined to the realm of theory. But this collection, he promises, will actually make it to the retail floor. Once there, it will go a long way toward restoring London’s reputation as a leader in real design intelligence.</p></div>"
49,spring,2003,s2003,helmut-lang,"After five years in New York, Helmut Lang returned to the same white space in Paris where he has sent out some of his finest collections—designs that changed the face of fashion. The atmosphere at the spring show was charged with nostalgia and anticipation. Would he hit those highs again?</p><p>The collection he showed was a case of revisiting the roots of his genre: layered T-shirt dressing, skinny pants, signature slim overcoats, abstracted prints, punky materials recontextualized. But time has passed. Since Lang has been in New York, his once raw, plugged-in connection to underground sources has been replaced by a quest for sophistication, expressed in abstract detailing and luxe materials. So the coats and pants got inserts or sleeves constructed of mesh, chiffon and leather. The T-shirts were often reduced to complex traceries of string. And there was cool white-beaded eveningwear, as a zippered dress or fragile jacket, intended to shine on a red carpet somewhere.</p><p>The change had to happen: as Lang well understands, minimalism is over, and his followers, like he is, are moving on. But that doesn't mean that they can't still be seduced by the designer's classic codes. Latex, bound and pieced into garments, hit just the right buttons, particularly in a pristine yellow-and-white-printed dress with a flip of the white stuff as its skirt.</p></div>"
50,spring,2003,s2003,imitation-of-christ,"""It's madness!"" said Chlo¿ Sevigny of the event staged by Imitation of Christ at the Maurice Villency furniture showroom in midtown Manhattan. ""Madness, in a good way."" Inside the all-white space, models mingled with their boyfriends and art-world luminaries, and the audience struggled to avoid getting mangled by the swarming paparazzi hungry for shots of IOC designer Tara Subkoff (in painted dress, Erickson Beamon dangling earring and cheeky fedora) and current flame Jimmy Fallon (in green military jacket).</p><p>Like all IOC events, the spring show, billed as a ""retrospective,"" was more about performance art and cultural theory than clothes. On the ground floor, topless models in very abbreviated shorts pranced around while pushing shiny vacuum cleaners (very David LaChapelle meets Vanessa Beecroft). They were flanked by vitrines filled with grass and live butterflies, and downstairs the Black Dice played cacophonous instrumental music as art videos and tapes of old IOC shows flickered on the walls.</p><p>A commentary on the hothouse worlds of art and fashion? A metaphor for the separation between viewer and viewed (a well-worn IOC theme)? Whatever the intention, the end result was that the label's pretty, wearable clothes were—once again—sacrificed to the spectacle.</p></div>"
51,spring,2003,s2003,istvan-francer,"A former assistant to Donna Karan, Istvan Francer is now emerging as a designer in his own right with the backing of Finpart, the owners of Cerruti. His third collection was evidence both of his experience in cutting and of his intelligent approach to the art of modern dressing. Though his silhouette was based on a tight, tiny top and a swirling skirt—an outline emerging everywhere now—he put his personal stamp on it. A Hungarian background gives the deisgner a taste for the decorative and romantic, which came through in gauzy black and gold lace dresses and some peasant-derived embroidery on a curvy jacket. Such distinctive characteristics were balanced by the designer’s light-handed, flattering touch, and the show marked a promising step along the road away from costume and toward wearability.</p></div>"
52,spring,2003,s2003,james-coviello,"Best known as the man behind Anna Sui's distinctive knits, James Coviello has been slowly building up his own sportswear line over the last two years. His spring collection was conclusive proof that he has an eye—and a wit—all his own.</p><p>Like many designers of his generation, Coviello likes to work a bit of retro irony into his collection, but he kept it from being cloying by adding just a touch of tough street edge. He took spring's ubiquitous sherbet colors and pushed them just a few hues deeper, resulting in unusual, interesting combinations: mauve and yellow, chartreuse and raspberry, lime and nude tones. A Fair Isle sweater got reworked as a ballet-neck tank top, paired with a skinny skirt; a full-skirted, floral-print dress was saved from becoming saccharine by the addition of a goofy, oversize bow and a very genteel black leather dog collar at the throat. Coviello's basics—pencil skirts, loose jackets and slim trousers—played smart second fiddle to lovely crocheted tops and snappy striped cardigans.</p></div>"
53,spring,2003,s2003,jean-paul-gaultier,"Having fun with a pun sometimes leads Jean Paul Gaultier to supreme elegance—other times to mayhem. This season, he got carried away with the idea of Alexander Calder's mobile sculptures, a concept he worked into a frenzy of visual quips about strings and suspension.</p><p>Opening with a tableau of circus acrobats twirling in the air on rings, swings and ropes of cloth, Gaultier followed up with a kind of anarchic rock-star parade, riffing on his chosen theme. There were overalls with the bib hanging down from one strap, swimsuits in abstract shapes held together with strings, and—every woman's worst nightmare—pants and tights falling down to reveal underwear. Throw in some touches of Victoriana, a couple of Indian saris and a few men's shirts and jackets tied on backward, and the joke gets strung out too long.</p><p>Calder, on the other hand, had nothing to do with the designer's best pieces. Hang a medal on Gaultier for the belt-size pleated miniskirts worn over super-skinny pants and, most of all, for the East-meets-West kimono-sleeve silky sport jackets with embroidery on the back.</p></div>"
54,spring,2003,s2003,jeremy-scott,"Relevance to modern life—and the modern fashion consumer—never seems to be at the forefront of Jeremy Scott's mind. He sees fashion more as an opportunity for cheeky social commentary (as in his ""I want money"" collection, where models threw fake gold coins into the audience) and a chance to indulge his sense of tongue-in-cheek, kitschy retro-futurism. Sometimes timely and amusing, his collections can also easily veer into the realm of gimmick.</p><p>Scott’s spring show, called ""Venus Rising,"" might as well have been called ""Valley Girls in Space."" With a rock-covered stage set and models sporting pointy Vulcan eyebrows and popped-up shoulders, the event recalled his space-age fall presentation, though with a more restrained group of colors. The designer started with some cute, wearable pieces including simple fitted minidresses and jersey shorts and tops. He then segued into a rainbow of bathing suits, some consisting of a mere strip or two of fabric. That was followed by a group of dresses, each with a distinct identity: One featured a pheasant-feather bodice over a shredded tan chiffon skirt, another was a simple silky robe in sea colors.</p><p>Scott clearly has enough imagination and skill to makes his shows consistently memorable. But his focus on developing a recognizable signature—and the business to go with it—could be stronger.</p></div>"
55,spring,2003,s2003,jil-sander,"When Jil Sander walked away from the house that bears her name, its experimental, intellectual ethos went with her, ending a chapter in fashion history. Now, with a design team headed by former retailer Milan Vukmirovic, the line’s emphasis is making commercially viable sportswear.</p><p>Spring’s direction is literally just that: a collection based on sporty clothing, a theme that emerged on London’s runways two weeks ago. Opening the show was a big, black, zippered cotton parka over shorts, paired with a shoe that is a cross between a high pump and a thong. The zipper motif was further explored in a punkish short dress and a sleeveless blouson, and eventually evolved into a tank top constructed of woven zips and a short dress made from a ballooning cascade of fasteners.</p><p>A workout theme took over as Vukmirovic converted track pants, T-shirts and anoraks into luxury pieces using perforated leather, sheer fabrics and mesh. It all culminated in a gold bugle-beaded top ready for a sprint round the summer party circuit.</p></div>"
56,spring,2003,s2003,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart’s trendy, youthful line is aimed squarely at the hip urban woman who is on first-name terms with the latest denim lines and the coolest DJs. Stuart started as a handbag designer before branching out into clothing, and although her designs may not be breaking new ground, she has a sharp sense of how to put her own spin on the current looks.</p><p>For spring, that meant a palette of colors that looked as though they’d been softened by time and wear—dusty rose, ivory, blue-gray and pale indigo. Stuart showed some nice takes on the boxy jackets and slim skirts that are in wide distribution this season, and there was a sweet nostalgia to some of the pieces, like a pink quilted satin jacket that looked like it was made from a comforter and a pretty black dress with a paper-bag neckline that would suit a modern Holly Golightly. But many of the styles evoked a more recent era. Oversize sweaters slipping off shoulders, low-riding pleated pants (paging Z. Cavaricci!) and cargo pants that ended in ribbed cuffs—all shown to a soundtrack that included Thomas Dolby and Dexy’s Midnight Runners—made the ’80s come back to life. For Stuart’s hip chick, that’s this year’s moment.</p></div>"
57,spring,2003,s2003,john-galliano,"When a model with a blue-painted face, wearing a giant tinsel hood, a vast exploding bubble of ruffles, green Lurex leggings and six-inch glitter platforms opens a show, we sense we are not exactly in for the average run-through of clothes to buy for summer. What John Galliano did instead was to lay on an outrageous piece of performance art, a spectacle that flew exuberantly in the face of fashion's normal purpose.</p><p>As inspiration for his latest piece of theater, the designer cited, among other things, Leigh Bowery, icon of early '80s London club culture. Galliano's 2003 homage to that era, in which competitive dressing was taken to ever more bizarre heights of do-it-yourself costume, took the form of enormously puffed-up shapes supported on hoops and covered in flounces; massive military jackets; swathes of sari fabric; and Indian-inspired makeup and jewelry.</p><p>Though someone searching for something to wear among this lot might have a hard time, Galliano is nothing if not sensitized to the current mood in fashion. The general message the collection conveyed was about the enjoyment of color, which has emerged as a major trend for spring. For his finale, he sent out girls whose voluminous outfits were covered in colored powders used in Indian festivals. As the models twirled, the audience was showered—and, incredibly, responded with laughter. As Galliano said, ""It's about time for a bit of joie de vivre, isn't it?""</p></div>"
58,spring,2003,s2003,julien-macdonald,"In a move that signaled the beginning of another episode of the ’80s déjà vu fest that has been playing all over London, Naomi Campbell opened Julien Macdonald’s show strutting her remarkably buff stuff in a white, cutout, rhinestone-studded swimsuit. Macdonald loves glamour, gorgeous girls, eye-socking color, vivid prints, high heels and big hair. Sound familiar? Maybe the thought of the upcoming Gianni Versace retrospective at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum inspired him. Whatever the source, the designer’s collection seemed a frank homage to those carefree days when supermodels prowled the runways wearing nothing very much to maximum possible effect.</p><p>Macdonald worked through grommet-studded jersey and leather pieces, strapless, frilly eyelet looks, and many variations on the theme of microscopically short asymmetric dresses (previous incarnations of which have proved a publicity godsend to many grateful London It girls).</p><p>The designer threw himself into a carnival spirit with multicolored print chiffons topped by outsize headdresses and shoulder pieces made of Caribbean flowers and vegetation—it’s summer, after all. Even if his glammed-up nostalgia isn’t to everyone’s taste, you have to credit Macdonald his relentless determination to show fashion a jolly good time.</p></div>"
59,spring,2003,s2003,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s show conjured a vision of innocent 18th-century milkmaids who had parachuted into a field of summer flowers. The girls seemed to have floated down from the sky under huge, airy umbrella hats, wearing drifty, white, flower-dotted prints suspended on webbing tape. Yes, webbing: in an original twist on this season’s ubiquitous combat trend, Watanabe made it look dreamily pretty. His prints, done in blue-and-white and rose-scattered fabrics, were made into cropped pants ruched into shorts and dresses hitched up at the hems. He also, thoughtfully, equipped his bucolic regiment with matching backpacks, some fused into the girls’ garments.</p><p>Watanabe’s was one of the few collections this season with a light, fresh take on summer dressing. But the designer could have made his point more effectively by editing out some of the variations on his theme, especially those in black and garish ’70s prints.</p></div>"
60,spring,2003,s2003,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli's intimate presentations, staged in her NoLIta store, are the perfect showcase for the designer's gently hip designs. A fan of under- rather than overstatement, Adeli lets trends murmur their way through her collection, rather than being shouted from the rooftops.</p><p>Her spring show suggested a country girl with glamorous ambitions. Adeli used tight jeans and snug overalls as a base layer over which she put delicate chiffon or jersey minidresses and tops. Her embellishments and styling referenced various decades: the '20s, the '70s (a flying eagle stretched across a white charmeuse top), the '80s (big ""boyfriend"" jackets over little dresses), but never glaringly so. Adeli also used a distinctive and eclectic palette: ivory, cobalt blue, canary yellow, black and tones of gray, along with the denim pieces. She may not be a verbose designer—the whole show was over in 14 looks—but Adeli's is a voice that carries.</p></div>"
61,spring,2003,s2003,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole makes the very flattering assumption that his customers are just as interested in being smart as they are in looking smart; that's (presumably) why his company has never hesitated to talk politics in its fashion ads. If you're a young, hip, liberal thinker, he seems to be saying, I can take care of you.</p><p>On the fashion front, being taken care of means having the prevailing trends clearly edited and presented—something that comes naturally to Cole. For spring, the designer showed tailored safari and motorcycle jackets in white, olive and taupe cotton, worn over swingy knee-length skirts, drapey jersey tops and sweet dresses with tiny floral prints. Cole avoided the ubiquitous cargo pant trend, keeping his trousers lean and low-cut instead. As might be expected from someone who made his name as a shoe designer, leather was sprinkled throughout: There were boxy jackets, suede skirts and plenty of extras like chain-link leather belts, generous shoulder bags and nifty gold toeless pumps.</p><p>More than half the looks that came down the runway were menswear; perhaps Cole is putting a bigger emphasis on building that part of his business. Or maybe he's realized that fashion, unlike politics, is truly an equal opportunity environment.</p></div>"
62,spring,2003,s2003,lagerfeld-gallery,"How to wear ultra-short? It's the brainteaser of spring fashion. For his Lagerfeld Gallery collection, Karl Lagerfeld gave shorts themselves a try. As part of the Diesel jeans group he integrates into the collection, Lagerfeld put frayed-edge denim shorts beneath minute chiffon dresses and under the teeny veils he had flipping around in place of evening skirts.</p><p>The jeans, with their signature center-front seam, sculpt the skinniest thigh on the planet. For spring, they're done in pale blue, cross-dyed purple and blue, faded black, or white, and lopped off just below the calf. Lagerfeld often put them under pretty lavender chiffon dresses for a more covered-up option.</p><p>For all the denim, this wasn't a casual collection. There was a Lagerfeldian framework that included formal jackets and crisp white shirt collars alongside feminine silk dresses. He did a few twists on the tux, including black taffeta-sleeved evening coats, cropped boleros and a white-tie vest. A line-up of pewter ciré swimsuits with boy-cut legs touched on the '60s trend. And the famously slimmed-down designer rivaled any model when he took his final bow in a pair of those long, leggy jeans.</p></div>"
63,spring,2003,s2003,lanvin,"Bouquets are due Alber Elbaz for excellent taste and innovative design aimed directly at the sophisticated women of the world. His spring collection for Lanvin was a rare vision of luxurious dressing, balancing luster with rawness in a grown-up, wearable way.</p><p>Elbaz composed the collection from four basic elements: rough-woven linen and gauzes, black satin ribbon, crystal jewelry and a color palette that ran from browns through bronze to dull gold. He started by taking on the difficult and much-neglected day suit, modernizing it by doing unlined, slubby jackets and skirts, leaving the edges raw and putting sheer blouses decorated with crystal and sequins underneath. The beauty was in the narrowness of the cut and the put-together look: flat Roman sandals made from satin ribbon, and hair pulled back in high buns and covered in black silk scarves, twinkling with a cool adaptation of the tiara. The designer also has a genius for dresses, which came in many variations on the goddess theme. The most exciting had clear silicone straps and what appeared to be integral jewelry at the neckline, creating the illusion that the whole garment was suspended by magic from the naked shoulder. Other evening options came in liquid gold satin and in a terra-cotta African-influenced print.</p><p>As a collection, Lanvin was a highly considered—and considerate—piece of work, executed with an impressive degree of respect for real women.</p></div>"
64,spring,2003,s2003,louis-vuitton,"Marc Jacobs' latest for Louis Vuitton is so very <em>kawaii</em> (that's Japanese for ""cute"") it's going to drive young women everywhere utterly nuts. Girl nation was thrown for a loop when the designer sent out a pastel-rainbow troupe of sweethearts in duchesse-satin zip-up dresses with Peter Pan collars. They tripped along carrying the latest monogram bags, perked up by computerized prints of little flowers and cartoon creatures, the work of the latest LV guest artist, Takashi Murakami.</p><p>The collection radiated a sunny '50s- and '60s-style optimism via little dresses, jackets, swingy skirts, knits and bathing suits finished with minute edgings of frills and tiny bows. There were strappy dresses with raised waists, some formfitting and others flared, done in a palette that ranged from the prettiest champagne through rose, lemon, pistachio and sky-blue. Even the swimsuits had that cute flip of a modesty flounce circa 1960.</p><p>In this, his third stellar collection of the season, Jacobs proved just how adept he is at merging happy retro memories and modern pop culture. His smartest crossover moves? Morphing rubber into cherry-red polka-dot pencil skirts, macs and suits decorated with 3-D flowers, and cutting ladylike jackets and coats out of printed neoprene. Add in jokey Minnie Mouse bows on peep-toe slingbacks and the result was a collection that will have lines forming around the block at Louis Vuitton stores from the first day of spring.</p></div>"
65,spring,2003,s2003,luella,"In contrast to her last collection, a valentine to hippie romanticism, Luella Bartley turned out a hard-edged show influenced by everything, said the designer, “from surfing to motocross.”</p><p>Bartley opened with a series of low-waisted minis paired with semi-sheer, French-cut leotards that came off as tough, somewhat trampy and very clubby. Her affinity for denim was evident throughout, and those pieces were among the collection’s strongest, particularly a drop-waisted, button-front number with distressed patches that lent it a (calculated) thrift-shop flair. The suits—one in neon yellow, the other with Carnaby stripes—were well cut, if blinding.</p><p>Sorbet-colored jackets and shirts had a cheeky air augmented by embroidered legends like ""Tornado"" and, of course, ""Luella,"" while customized pink-and-white checkered Vans staked out a rebel-teen territory somewhere between <em>Blue Crush</em> and the East End of London.</p></div>"
66,spring,2003,s2003,m-r-s-,"M.R.S. started a few years ago as a side project for Molly Stern—something to do when she had time between jobs as a makeup artist for rock stars and celebrities. She would literally sew her cotton jersey tops and dresses right onto her clients’ bodies, using a signature overlock stitch on raw seams. Considering that those clients included friends like Milla Jovovich, Gisele Bündchen and Courtney Love, it's not surprising that Stern’s project took on a life of its own.</p><p>Now the M.R.S. line (those are Stern's initials) has become a real business, complete with its first fashion show, held at the Barneys Co-Op store in Soho. The designer presented her pastel-toned collection in a <em>tableau vivant</em> inspired by <em>How to Marry a Millionaire</em>. Each outfit came with a title and a narrative: a combination of drawstring pants and pink blouse was dubbed “Active Arts and Leisure""; a soft top paired with short shorts was labeled ""The Front Porch Relaxer""; and a short, frilly halter dress was titled ""The Saturday Night Swisher,"" Stern wisely kept things light and brief by showing only 16 outfits, each with enough pert charm to keep its wearer smiling all through the spring.</p></div>"
67,spring,2003,s2003,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"The magic of Marc by Marc Jacobs, the designer’s popular secondary line, is not in revolutionary shapes or cuts. It’s in the way he puts it together, as though channeling the wardrobe whims of an imaginary girl whose moods, and outfits, shift from moment to moment. One moment she’s an eccentric, artsy bohemian in a rainbow chiffon dress worn over a mock turtleneck and opaque black tights; the next, she’s dressed for a proper party in a sweet black knee-length dress with tiers of ruffles, or playing the coquette in a red check dress with a sweetheart neckline.</p><p>He may pick up a trend, but the Jacobs spin is what makes it inimitable. His skirts, cut slim or with an A-line flare, are done in sassy colors like red, pink, lemon yellow or mint, and paired with boxy cotton motorcycle jackets. Denim always plays a starring role in the Marc show, and this season it showed up in a sexy little spaghetti-strap dress, slim cropped trousers and a zip-front mechanic’s jumpsuit replete with zippers. There were also plenty of the skinny trench coats that have become a signature item, done in traditional khaki but also in eye-snapping yellow or tomato red. The Marc girl can rest assured that, no matter what her mood, she’ll find something to love.</p></div>"
68,spring,2003,s2003,marc-jacobs,"Hard and soft, past and present, good girl and bad girl—Marc Jacobs loves to play with opposites. For Spring, he worked all those elements together into a collection that was sweet but with a hint of a hard edge—like a debutante who knows the bartender's name, or like Exene Cervenka, the lead singer of L.A. punk band X, whose songs made up the bulk of the night's soundtrack.</p><p>Part of the season's interesting dichotomy came from the silhouette: Jacobs cut a more frankly feminine shape than he has in the recent past, with deep necklines on full-skirted dresses, body-hugging sheaths under boxy jackets, and snug pencil skirts or cigarette pants paired with sexy camisole tops. And part of it was his flower-garden color choices: soft pink, lavender, pale yellow, orange, chartreuse, and ivory. For even greater contrast, he manipulated soft, airy fabrics like satin, lace, and cashmere against dense ribbed ottoman, nubby, Chanel-evoking tweeds, and silk shantung.</p><p>Jacobs brings in retro references both obliquely and directly; this season, he picked up bits from the cocktail-shaker days of the fifties and sixties: tiny bows and rolled collars, woozy polka-dot prints, ""cocktail"" dresses made from lace and satin. But despite its knowing dalliance with the past, this was a collection rooted very firmly in the here and now.</p></div>"
69,spring,2003,s2003,markus-lupfer,"Markus Lupfer doesn’t usually make overtly sexy clothes. When he arrived on the London scene in the late ’90s, his style was all about revisiting ladylike classics with an avant-garde sensibility. But things have moved on, and Lupfer has now revved up his ideas to suit a leggy London girl who likes to go out. He’s also caught on to several of the trends emerging on the city’s runways: short jersey dresses, bright colors, all-in-ones and raunchy ’80s-flavored sport clothes.</p><p>Lupfer updated winter combat pants, in white cotton, by simplifying them—cropping them at the knee and putting them with high heels and a drapey cream lace tank. His all-in-ones came as either loose, faded dungarees or fitted overalls that had nothing to do with auto mechanics. His dresses, in single shots of orange jersey or mixed-print chiffon, came short and bloused up at the waist, to give a flippy volume to the skirt. Throughout the collection, Lupfer found fresh uses for his well-known skills with print and leather. There were dotty, orange-and-white plunging swimsuits, bold neon-pink zigzags and punched-out summer leathers made into mini trapeze dresses and skirts. Looks like he’s left his artsy librarian far behind.</p></div>"
70,spring,2003,s2003,marni,"Seems like the Marni hippie chick has been on a trip uptown. She still loves pretty prints and fabrics derived from antique furnishings, but for spring, she’s taken a style diversion, adding both haute accessories and biker references to the eclectic mix.</p><p>Designer Consuelo Castiglioni’s favorite things—shrunken jackets, print dresses, stripy pants and delicate lacy camisoles—were all there, present and correct, in her summer collection, as was her knack for casually layering one precious, romantic piece on top of another. But those familiar ticking stripes this time came in satin, cut into pants and asymmetric skirts. A tougher, glossier Marni was also playing around with sexy leather vests and zip-detailed pants. Most surprising of all, Castiglioni flung off the clogs, hippie belts and ethnic bags: all her accessories for spring looked like an homage to vintage Hermès, from the stack-heeled canvas sandals to the chunky belts laden with gilt hardware.</p></div>"
71,spring,2003,s2003,martine-sitbon,"Who says Americans have the market cornered on clever sportswear? Martine Sitbon's spring show was a distinctly French commentary on current trends that proved smart design knows no borders.</p><p>Most of the season's usual suspects were present and accounted for: blouson jackets, lingerie pieces, jumpsuits and micro shorts, sport influences, and utility details. But Sitbon is one of those designers who can reference the themes of the moment without relinquishing her own (artsy) identity. She softened a safari jacket by cutting it in pale-lavender satin, and feminized the sport motif by using wide, striped ribbon—inserted here and there on short, swingy jersey dresses, wrapped around bodices and run down the seam of slim satin pants.</p><p>Sitbon knows how to flatter the ins and outs of a woman's figure with innovative cutting, although sometimes she piled up too many ideas in one outfit. But in a season full of me-too collections—seemingly aimed at a teenage constituency—her strong sense of self was refreshing. And who else but a French designer would be so comfortable making corsets and garter belts the basis of a series of sexy little dresses?</p></div>"
72,spring,2003,s2003,matthew-williamson,"“Hello, is there anybody home?” were the lyrics that opened Matthew Williamson’s second New York show, just seconds after Britney Spears had arrived wearing a printed, beaded top from the designer’s new collection. Signaling the high wattage of the event, her fellow front-row occupants included Helena Christensen, Carine Roitfeld, Mario Testino, and a regiment of Sykes sisters.</p><p>Titled “Flamingo Bay,” the show was a sumptuous distillation of all Williamson’s strengths into one long, cool fashion cocktail that is sure to be seen around town and in magazine editorials for months to come. The designer’s signature mix of print, pattern, beading and patchwork was perfectly calibrated, especially in a series of breezy, color-infused chiffon dresses and tunics with intricately beaded necklines and the closing series of evening dresses with leafy black overbeading. Yes, there is somebody home, and it looks like he’s going to be around for a while.</p></div>"
73,spring,2003,s2003,maurizio-pecoraro,"Maurizio Pecoraro has a proven talent for delving into the romantic and folkloric, using a good deal of delicate handcraft to produce pretty, vintagey effects. But now that the peasant hordes are fast disappearing over the fashion horizon, he’s turned to a new source of inspiration: the op art ’60s.</p><p>The opening shots were all knitwear, done in bright, sporty stripes and patterns and shown with fluorescent makeup. Then came shifts, spangled with circles of sequin and paired with silver go-go boots, followed by Bridget Riley–inspired optical prints and details like appliqu¿d plastic rings. Pecoraro isn’t exactly going out on a limb, since many designers are plumbing the geometrics and plastics of the early ’60s for ideas. But it is a tough one to pull off with conviction, and the designer’s collection looked better when he reverted to the softer femininity of the silver sequin, applied to floppy chiffons, which came out at the end of his show.</p></div>"
74,spring,2003,s2003,max-mara,"What does a label known worldwide for beautiful winter coats do when the weather turns warmer? Hope for rain, of course. MaxMara based its spring collection on raincoats, making them part of a sexy-chic wardrobe that can take its following of working women through good and bad weather alike.</p><p>The show opened with a short, belted olive patent version, worn with gladiator sandals buckled around the shins. The slick mac also turned up in firefighter yellow, then became the basis of a skirt suit, in both beige and bright orange. Life isn’t all 9 to 5, though. MaxMara’s designers applied themselves to beach- and eveningwear as well. There were breezy linen-voile shirt dresses—ruched in back to give a sense of feminine form—shown over swimwear.</p><p>When it came to nightfall, the collection picked up on the ’60s trend that is bubbling all over Milan. Short, drapey jersey dresses came anchored to the body with silver-metal neck pieces straight out of the Courrèges space-age period. If a more down-to-earth dinner date is on the agenda, there was an oyster satin suit that walked the line between sensible propriety and on-trend glamour.</p></div>"
75,spring,2003,s2003,michael-kors-collection,"As much as he loves Gotham glamour, even Michael Kors needs to get out of the city once in a while. For spring, he headed to California, taking inspiration from its laid-back way of life and those casual style icons (Slim Keith, Lauren Bacall) whose sex appeal was about ease, not sleaze.</p><p>Kors paid homage to the great outdoors, Left Coast–style, via cotton piqué polo shirts, snappy little dresses (accessorized with practical, flat shoes and golf gloves) and a few bathing suits, all done in classic neutrals: khaki, navy, white, ivory. For those times when even beach bunnies have to come indoors, Kors added relaxed, knee-length jersey dresses and skirts in bands of blue-sky tones; crisp cotton tuxedo shirts worn with tailored pants; and fuzzy twinsets in bold turquoise. Lovely guipure dresses and organza skirts paired with the simplest knit tops were just right for poolside parties, with a glossy leather jacket or a supple deerskin balmacaan to ward off brisk nighttime breezes. And to pack it all up for an impromptu weekend in Lake Tahoe, Kors provided generous leather totes that fit perfectly in the trunk of the Mustang.</p></div>"
76,spring,2003,s2003,miguel-adrover,"The last couple years have been a roller-coaster ride for Miguel Adrover. The one-time media darling known for transforming humble materials into tailored tours de force became the black sheep of the industry after back-to-back seasons of Egyptian-inspired fashions that fell flat at retail. So his spring show was a make-or-break event—and Adrover more than rose to the occasion.</p><p>Titled “Citizen of the World,” the collection was inspired by the New York immigrant experience. But from look one (Omahyra wearing striped trousers and a fringed “ghetto” tank top made of do-rags), it was clear that the clothes transcended the labels (“banker,” “hasidim,” “traveler”) and themes (a tarmac-styled runway) imposed on them. The strongest looks, like a simply elegant, extra-large T-shirt dress, were gimmick-free, while Adrover’s sharkskin suits and “New Yorker” blazer were crowd-pleasing exercises in precision tailoring. For evening, the designer seemed to channel Adrian, sending out a Jean Harlow–worthy silk satin dress and a high-wattage, Swarovski-beaded gown miraculously pieced together from myriad puzzle-shaped pieces.</p><p>All this was presented to a soundtrack that morphed from takeoffs and landings to a steady heartbeat. An apt metaphor for a career that now looks to be on a straight—and resolutely individual—track.</p></div>"
77,spring,2003,s2003,missoni,"<em>Basta</em> to eclectic peasant dressing. This season, the Missoni girl has kicked off her hippie sandals and slipped on a pair of high, shiny pumps. She might be on a sexy road, but full-on wantonness is not her style. Instead she's pulled together a look that combines feminine, flirty, body-conscious pieces, like bustiers and scarf dresses, with the knits and patterns that are her true passion.</p><p>The house’s signature zigzag stitch this time came in citified trenches, pencil skirts and belted knicker suits bound with black leather. Angela Missoni used black satin to add a glam vibe to slim pants, cropped trousers and jackets, but the stars here were the vivid colors, silky stripes and cloudy pastel geometric flowers. A chiffon blouson and a knee-length drifty dress worn with a skimpy little cardigan looked simply irresistible.</p></div>"
78,spring,2003,s2003,miu-miu,"Miu Miu is the place to go for neat, unpretentious versions of whatever trends happen to be falling from the sky in a season. Right now, that means the line is awash with bright color, prints, chinoiserie, sporty clothing, goddess dresses and high hemlines.</p><p>Miuccia Prada’s knack is to bring such elements together in a fresh, offhand way. For spring, she pulled oversize sweaters on top of white shirts and paired them with Hawaiian prints made into Bermudas and caban coats; the whole look was perched atop ’70s-esque snakeskin platform shoes. A few of the shirts fastened at an angle like a cheongsam, a theme that returned at the end of the show in vibrant fuchsia and crocus-yellow crumpled satin.</p><p>The Miu Miu girl can work some athletic style into her life with wide, cropped cotton drill jackets, jersey cheerleader skirts and sawed-off sweats, making sure to flash maximum leg at all times. A few white cotton goddess dresses and bra-topped baby-dolls came down the runway, though the show's kicker was an eye-socking short coat in the brightest red satin. The collection didn't push any intellectual frontiers, but it did provide plenty of straightforward stuff to wear, and that’s just fine.</p></div>"
79,spring,2003,s2003,moschino,"The late Franco Moschino was fashion’s greatest prankster, always playing the silliest tricks on his audience to jolt them out of their seriousness. So when the models at this house decided to open the show by walking the runway backward, it was a jape that took the audience back to the old days in a very welcome way. After the laughter, though, came a lot of scribbling in notebooks, because the clothes the girls were wearing happened to be some of the youngest, perkiest, most wearable in Milan this season.</p><p>All of Italy’s major Spring fashion statements, from kimonos to prints to chiffons to layers, came down the Moschino runway. The bonus was that everything was handled with a great sense of color—pretty pastels, tiny flower prints mixed with polka dots—and without any vulgarity. Add in nippy styling ideas, like sheer apron dresses, sprinkled with sequins, to wrap over almost anything a girl owns, and the result is a design feat that merited all that happy applause.</p></div>"
80,spring,2003,s2003,narciso-rodriguez,"Narciso Rodriguez, like several other designers, has been on a diet this past year. And as he’s slimmed, so have his clothes. The precise silhouette he’s been refining over the past few seasons has shrunk in for spring, hugging the body’s curves like a second, very elegant, skin.</p><p>The heart of the collection was a dress constructed in sections: a pencil skirt, topped by a tightly defined midriff, sometimes in crisp cotton, sometimes in sheer jersey. There were variations for day, done in black and white, with insets of taupe jersey or bits of bright color that gave the look a distinctly <em>sportif</em> feeling. Rodriguez occasionally threw on a minute jacket or Lilliputian sweater to play with the proportions, but he never strayed far from the center. There were luxe versions for nighttime, done in various kinds of silk and lightened with touches of floaty georgette. Another star of the night was a pink floor-length dress in heavy, creamy kimono silk that had the front row—Kyra Sedgwick, Julianna Margulies, a very pregnant Sarah Jessica Parker— oohing in admiration.</p><p>In lesser hands, such single-minded devotion could have been monotonous. But Rodriguez is a master of subtle invention, and the collection’s charisma never flagged.</p></div>"
81,spring,2003,s2003,oscar-de-la-renta,"Front and center at life's rich pageant—that's where Oscar de la Renta wants to be. Leaving the monochrome color schemes and workaday fabrics to others, this is a designer who deals in luxury, elegance and—always—vibrant femininity.</p><p>As with his fall collection, de la Renta worked Oriental influences into both his palette and detailing. His colors were so saturated they evoked a spice market: crimson red, saffron yellow, chocolate brown, mint green, pink and lavender. He placed an increased emphasis on accessories this season, adding everything from a pretty beaded bag to a chunky necklace to a toile print handbag in his signature football shape. The clothes were classic de la Renta silhouettes: neatly tailored trousers and shirts, smart silk shirtdresses and pretty, swingy skirts worn with linen tops. A sculpted, perfectly balanced boxy jacket made from cream-colored ottoman paid homage to Cristobal Balenciaga, while the gold matelassé pieces—particularly the ""jean"" jacket—would make a modern rajah very happy.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn't be a de la Renta show without a ruffle or two hundred. Tightly gathered, limp and loose, stacked or single, they bore witness to this designer’s mastery of the medium. That's why the soundtrack—Nelly urging his listeners to take off all their clothes—was such a puzzle. If you're wearing de la Renta, why would you want to?</p></div>"
82,spring,2003,s2003,paul-smith,"Rock ’n’ roll softened by English quirkiness. That’s the essence of Paul Smith’s spring collection. Showing to a soundtrack of Stones and Rod Stewart oldies, the designer playfully rearranged an anthology of rock-chick classics, from a Keith Richards-esque black topcoat to leather jeans, micro shorts and vests to pointy, pink vintage bras and hoodies, strung about with punky chains.</p><p>Smith’s not really a man for the tough girls, though, and his cheeky sense of humor undercut the show’s harder edge. Never able to resist putting in a pun somewhere, he referenced his menswear background by sewing together ties to form skirts. He left his boyish tailoring raw at the edges and turned men’s formal white piqué dress shirts, complete with undone dickey bows, into dresses. When he finally indulged his nostalgic leanings by sending out tiny-rosebud and tablecloth prints, the vibe had reverted from a backstage Jack Daniels binge for the groupies to a 1950s English tea party on a summer afternoon. Isn’t Sir Paul nice?</p></div>"
83,spring,2003,s2003,peter-som,"There are clothes that look good, and then there are clothes that feel good. Peter Som, a 31-year-old designer who has logged time at Calvin Klein, Bill Blass and Michael Kors, believes those two notions are fully compatible. And his spring collection was a compelling argument in support of that belief.</p><p>Som was inspired by Jacques-Henri Lartigue's photos of the French Riviera between the wars; think romantic walks on the beach, kirs at sunset, smoky jazz clubs. Updating that ideal to suit the practical needs of the twenty-first st-century American consumer, he used sunny striped silk in slim pajama pants and blouses, black and cream canvas in squared-off jackets and Mediterranean-blue lamb suede for a luxurious slipdress. Som kept the shapes simple, adding originality via details like channel stitching, asymmetrical hems on skirts and distinctive color combinations like deep blue and chocolate brown. With one clunky exception—a series of cotton canvas gauchos—this was a collection with appeal for elegant women of any era.</p></div>"
84,spring,2003,s2003,pierrot,"A beefy male lifeguard in a tiny bikini. Pneumatic Amanda Lepore doing a slo-mo sprint down the runway in a red <em>Baywatch</em> bathing suit. Senior citizens in his-and-hers lion-print velour. Flamingos, palm trees, miniskirts and short shorts. Only the crankiest fashion editor could have made it through Pierrot’s giddy spring collection without cracking a smile.</p><p>The knitwear designer stages his shows around themes, and he chose the sunniest possible location—the beach—for his collection of crochet and jersey separates. He took classic color combinations like pink and green or red, white and blue and made them into simple shapes in girly proportions: mini kilts, shrunken tennis sweaters, cropped baseball jackets and some very cute faux-denim jackets with detailed stitching and sequins. While his silhouettes aren’t going to break any new ground (there are limits to the knit and purl, after all), the clothes have a cheerful charm that goes a long way.</p></div>"
85,spring,2003,s2003,prada,"Miuccia Prada has trained the fashion world to expect—indeed, to crave—the unexpected from her shows. Even those audience members who came dressed head to toe in her winter “sex” collection were there to see which sharp new turn she would take next. They were not to be disappointed. The designer let her fall Helmut Newton-esque fantasy evaporate in favor of something much cleaner, rearranging all her hallmarks—a love of couture fabrics, an obsession with the ’60s, and the ability to appropriate ethnic touches and play with modernist cuts—as never before.</p><p>She opened with bright, singing color: a neon-pink cheongsam shirt with an orange-sorbet short skirt, both in luxurious duchesse satin. And by accessorizing the look with sporty goggles, thrust on top of the head, and flat silver sandals, she steered well clear of any literal vintage reference. The same mind-set could be seen at work in a sequence of white T-shirt pieces decorated with patches of plastic beading, and in a pair of Bermudas cut from shiny couture-like brocade and worn with a racer-back tank. Prada reinvented jewelry, too, tying on flat leather breast pieces encrusted with plastic beads or fusing them into the necklines of bra-top jersey dresses.</p><p>The best measure of the collection’s success was that nothing was complicated, despite the complex merging of sport, color, luxury and ’60s elements. Many designers have been grasping at these disparate themes for spring, but few have been able to filter them into anything as appealingly wearable as Prada’s short satin trenches and flippy, white elastic-waist dresses.</p></div>"
86,spring,2003,s2003,rafael-lopez,"Rafael Lopez is one of the many designers who have contracted the ’70s-sporty bug that’s broken out in London. His particular strain crosses military styling with ’70s disco glam.</p><p>His opening look said it all: Erin O’Connor with glam-rock sequined eye makeup, stalking diva-like in a white parachute-silk jumpsuit and vertiginous heels. He then sent out frizzy-haired disco dollies wearing strange stripped-down T-shirts (more strip than tee, in fact), a design idea that started out in the minds of Helmut Lang and Hussein Chalayan but has suddenly morphed into the season’s sexy trend.</p><p>A lot of white jersey dresses and swishing fringe later, Lopez segued into shorty showgirl dresses. Done in lingerie pink or with swags of blue silk yarn, these seemed to derive from John Galliano’s <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> references for Christian Dior’s couture. Lopez is intent on building a retail business, but he seems a spirit divided: cool London street person or hot-blooded Latin?</p></div>"
87,spring,2003,s2003,ralph-lauren,"Some designers will tell you what their inspiration is; Ralph Lauren actually takes you there. To stage his spring show, Lauren pitched an enormous muslin-draped tent, filled with white cushions, huge candles and twinkling crystal chandeliers, in the lush walled gardens of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. Entering the building, the audience was met with trays of champagne, while the smell of tuberose and the strains of Erik Satie wafted through the evening air.</p><p>If that wasn’t enough to induce a romantic swoon, the clothes would have done the trick. Lauren loves the womanly silhouette of the fin-de-si¿cle, with its nipped waist and curving hips. For spring he chose to highlight that silhouette with regal fabrics like damask, jacquard and silk moir¿, made into curvy jackets, bustiers and vests, and shown with creamy linen or silk trousers or light, pretty skirts. There were great leather pieces, gilded or printed with a wallpaper floral, and beautiful, skin-baring silk chiffon dresses. While Lauren makes no secret of his love for the past, he’s also resolutely modern: For evening, he showed a beaded top with a floor-length bustle skirt made from very distressed blue denim.</p></div>"
88,spring,2003,s2003,rick-owens,"It's hard to believe that Rick Owens lives in the same Los Angeles that people like Sheryl Crow inhabit. His distinctly Gothic vision would appear more at home in a nice damp, dark climate—like, say, Antwerp.</p><p>Owens sometimes seems equally disconnected from the rest of the fashion community. Other designers may knuckle under, but rest assured a pencil skirt is never going to show up on his runway. And why should it? His talent is well established, and he has a loyal, bicoastal fan base happy to keep buying his soft wrapped jerseys, lightweight dresses and supple leathers.</p><p>That said, the designer’s Spring show was virtually identical to fall, except that the colors and fabrics were lighter, and both the men’s and women’s collections were presented. There are no hard edges to Owens' pieces: tailored pants and jackets are deliberately abraded and roughed-up; body-hugging dresses and skirts are fashioned from swaths of bias-cut, gossamer-light jersey; and his famous leathers are washed and crumpled. In fact, despite their lugubrious styling, Owens' pieces are sexy, beautifully made and supremely comfortable. Maybe he really is from L.A., after all.</p></div>"
89,spring,2003,s2003,roberto-cavalli,"These days, Roberto Cavalli, senior rock god of Italian fashion, has to build a stadium to contain the legions of fans who throng to witness his spectacular shows. Deservedly so. His body-enhancing, glamorous, beautifully embellished Spring collection—all chinoiserie, corsetry and exuberant print—was grandstand material par excellence.</p><p>The designer struck a right-on opening chord with a deep-blue embroidered kimono—a key trend of Milan fashion week—outrageously amplified with a raw-edged leopard-spot lining. He followed up the Asian riff with the briefest of curvy cheongsams in luscious print satin, then with dragon-painted matte leather, in lacquer red and black, cut into body-hugging, flipped-out minidresses and jeans. When he laid torso-clinching corsets over flyaway handkerchief-point print chiffon dresses over leather pants, the more-is-more decibel level reached a pitch that brought down the house.</p><p>There’s more to Cavalli, though, than pumping up the volume. The techniques he applied to his materials and cuts—like distressed, crumpled leathers and delicately pieced floor-length gowns in chiffon and lace—underscored the brashness with a grace note of quality. And that’s what makes him a maestro.</p></div>"
90,spring,2003,s2003,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret’s Spring collection was a distinct change in mood from the retro romanticism of his fall show. Mouret said his inspiration was “key British movements—the ’50s, mods and punks,” and the disheveled models had a certain morning-after air about them. Being French, though, Mouret’s version of grunge is essentially feminine, rather than down and dirty.</p><p>There were a few bondage straps and D-rings sprinkled throughout the collection, along with motorcycle and blouson jackets, and a few low-riding circle skirts. Mouret also grabbed onto a look that’s been a starting point for many of the London collections: cropped combat pants worn with heels and tank tops so shredded they barely constitute garments at all.</p><p>His strongest offerings were sexy minis with flirty box pleats, a skinny, elongated black blouson over lean pants, and fluid evening silhouettes with corseted strapless tops. Mouret is expanding into other frontiers, as well: a new jewelry line features uncut diamonds—one of which was enticingly implanted in a model’s navel.</p></div>"
91,spring,2003,s2003,ruffo-research,"The Ruffo Research collection serves two purposes: it draws attention to the experimental capabilities of one of Italy’s premier leather companies, and it acts as an incubator for young talents, who are invited to design the line in two-season stints.</p><p>For spring 2003, Haider Ackermann, a 31-year-old resident of Antwerp, Belgium, took up the Ruffo baton, previously held by fellow countrymen A.F. Vandevorst, Ve;ronique Branquinho and Raf Simons. Does Ackermann share their Belgian moodiness? Yes, but with his own angle. Like many current post-deconstructionist designers, he interprets “edge” to mean a respect for quality and elegance that can appeal to a sophisticated audience.</p><p>His instinct is to upgrade cool street clothes for grown-ups. Here, that meant track pants in a flattering cut, narrow jackets, easy dress shapes and subdued grays, brown and white. He met the Ruffo challenge by folding and weaving its suedes and leathers as if they were fabric. He turned the softest suede into sunburst-pleated skirts and poncho dresses and made slim track pants out of fine plissé skins. The best pieces were a brilliantly cut plain mushroom pinafore with a sexy racer back and a delicately pleated and perforated white skirt.</p></div>"
92,spring,2003,s2003,russell-sage,"Russell Sage opened London fashion week for spring 2003 by invoking the name of fellow Brit Charles Frederick Worth, the Victorian gentleman who set up the very first haute couture house in Paris. Seeking to restore pride in the grand, almost-lost tradition of English craftsmanship, Sage enlisted the help of centuries-old U.K. businesses, from tailors Davies &amp; Son and shirtmakers Turnbull &amp; Asser to Lobb &amp; Co. (shoes) and the Gainsborough Silk Weaving Company (brocades).</p><p>Though there’s no doubting Sage’s wish to support his country’s heritage, he seemed to be at a loss in terms of how to harness all that history. Reverting to his own background as a dealer in antique furnishing fabrics, he added fragments of precious Chinese silks, taffetas and velvets—all intrinsically beautiful in dusty, time-faded colors—to the mix. But he struggled to find a silhouette on which to pin all these marvelous materials. His conceptual thread wandered from vaguely 1960s black dresses to obis fastened with vast padded bows in back to 1950s swimsuit shapes made in brocade.</p><p>The designer’s best moment was a series of high-waisted dresses, in a rainbow of coral, pistachio, sky blue and violet, detailed with inserts of reclaimed crushed velvet. For some in the audience, though, the only place to look was forward—to his next project, the interior design of a château belonging to the cognac house Hine (a commission from LVMH). Dressing walls, windows and furniture instead of girls just might be the best use of Sage’s talents.</p></div>"
93,spring,2003,s2003,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford can take any one of dozens of nuggets of inspiration from the rich mine of Yves Saint Laurent's heritage—with a couple of caveats. First he needs to unearth something that resonates with the here and now, and second he has to forge it into something completely distinct from his work at Gucci. He did both those things for summer by dipping into Saint Laurent's pre–WW II surrealist phase.</p><p>""I think these are surreal times we're living in,"" said the designer, ""but the references are subtle."" He's right: his first look—a brown jacket with a silk rose at the bosom, paired with a coffee-colored knee-length chiffon dress—didn’t send any overt historical messages. The line of the shoulder may have been strong, but it didn't scream ""'40s"" or, for that matter, <em>Dynasty</em>-style '80s. Indeed, the muted colors, like soft lavender, champagne and coffee, and the jacket-and-soft-skirt combination seemed almost within the bounds of ladylike.</p><p>That is, until you got close enough to see the details. Some, like enamel lips and toenails on shoes, the print of a woman’s behind on the back of a skirt, and a trompe l'oeil wing pattern on an evening cloak, were relatively harmless—Dalí by way of Schiaparelli. Others, however, pushed the envelope a lot further. Ford put purple paint on the models' nipples, and cut jackets and coats like corsets, with a button planted on the tip of each breast. He also designed a black chiffon evening gown with an elongated keyhole surrounded with ruffles; framed in the opening was a small iron pendant, which, upon closer examination, turned out to be a penis.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""zbgdud""></div></div><p>This, then, was a collection that let Ford have it both ways. As well as guaranteeing himself headlines with scandalizing gestures, he slipped out a lot of uncontroversial clothes, including some—a beautiful little black dress and a couple of slim-panted tuxedos—that were real gems.</p></div>"
94,spring,2003,s2003,sonia-rykiel,"Sonia Rykiel may be the grande dame of Paris ready-to-wear, but she ain't no prude. Her summer collection, true to her '70s roots, was full of little sexpot knits—not to mention a few unscheduled poppings-out of bosoms.</p><p>Rykiel proved here that there's nowhere knitwear can't follow when a trend is in the offing. She did slouchy overalls on elongated straps, which were sometimes worn in an offhand way, with the bib trailing down. Lurex stripes, floppy black knit hats (worn by every girl in the show) and her signature sweaters with glittery cartoons on the front looked as neatly current as they did 30 years ago. The runway problem came, though, when the more well-endowed models bounced along in the designer's ultra-skimpy knitted bra tops. Often the tiny triangles proved not quite up to their task of containment.</p></div>"
95,spring,2003,s2003,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki is the 30-year-old designer on whom London pins its hope for the next talent who will rise up and fly internationally. What’s brought her to this point is her strong but feminine style, the coherence of her collections and her faithfulness to her cultural roots. Some see the Greek designer as the brainy blood sister of Hussein Chalayan, Nicolas Ghesquière and Helmut Lang, in terms of both her sensibility and her loner instincts.</p><p>Just as important as the girl’s intellectual credibility, though, is the fact that she has evolved a signature dress—a piece with that elusive quality that makes it stand out in a store. The Kokosalaki dress has a slightly raised waist with something intriguing and handcrafted going on in the bodice. She’s been working at it over the years, making it better and more refined—and this season much sexier—as she goes. Her killer summer frock is in whittled-away black jersey, fastened to the body by a fine spiderweb of silken chain stitch that traces a pattern on the naked skin.</p><p>That dress and close variations on it form the center of a collection inspired, the designer says, by Byzantine art—specifically dusty terra-cottas and faded teals, glowing metallic mosaics and one-dimensional images of drapery. These she translated into swirly cutouts on suede, dresses embedded with smoky Swarovski crystal and tiny mirrors, and flattened trapunto embroidery. From modern Greece, Kokosalaki took the votive tin images of hearts, babies and eyes used by Orthodox worshipers and applied them to a suede vest.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""icptm""></div></div><p>Was it a departure collection? Conceptually, no. Rather than let the pressure of attention push her into grand theatrics, Kokosalaki opted to stick to her chosen path. Which is exactly the quality of independence likely to get her there—wherever there is—in the end.</p></div>"
96,spring,2003,s2003,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney has a brand to build—and a beautiful new store to go with it. For summer, she'll be filling her shop with the kind of clothes for which she’s already known: flighty little dresses and chiffon blouses, mixed with great suits. Her departure this season was to leave aside the street-toughness of some of her former collections, replacing it with delicate washed-out color and embellished details. There was a lot more polish and softness about this show—a confident step forward for a young designer who's taking her place on the international platform.</p><p>Vintage-inspired lingerie, one of McCartney's recurring themes, was threaded through the collection. The opening bodysuit was pieced in rose satin and chiffon and worn with sage-green puffy shorts; a later jumpsuit had lace inserts running down the sides. Addicts of the designer's mannish tailoring, meanwhile, will have found her quintessential jacket done in gray-blue Prince of Wales check, matched with pants that had a lattice of open work along the outside seam.</p><p>Don't imagine Stella's quite settled down to the quiet life yet, though. For evening, she festooned gold chains onto the bodices of cutout dresses and tops, and amped up the jacket with traceries of glitter. Her hippest new idea came in the form of puffy satin bombers—she transformed one, a bright-yellow fusion of sport and chinoiserie print, into an off-the-shoulder bubble dress. McCartney is so into the glam-bomber idea, in fact, that she bounded onto the runway wearing a black version herself.</p></div>"
97,spring,2003,s2003,tommy-hilfiger,"Everybody needs a vacation, even if it's only a mental break. For his spring collection, Tommy Hilfiger packed a bag for Mustique (where he actually does own a home) and showed just how easily sportswear can travel.</p><p>Setting his sights on the twin goals of glamour and practicality, Hilfiger built his women's collection largely on silky charmeuse cargo pants and skirts in neutral tones like navy, ivory and olive. He paired those with lacy tank tops (for an afternoon of shopping) or halters and bustiers that added a bit more <em>oomph</em> (for the mai tai hour). There were flirty, swingy tiered skirts that cried out to be worn over the crochet bikinis or with a simple cotton polo, and crisp, cropped seersucker jackets guaranteed to ward off cool island breezes—even if your island is Manhattan.</p><p>Of course, no vacation is complete without some serious beach time, and Hilfiger came prepared for that, too. While the bashful might opt for a shell-printed pareu to wear over the skimpy bikinis, those looking for some attention on the lido would do well to mimic Naomi Campbell. Her undulating stroll down the runway in a navy jacket and silk bikini bottoms turned even the jaded photographers into wolf-whistling boys.</p></div>"
98,spring,2003,s2003,tyler,"Richard Tyler got his start as a tailor to the stars—rock stars, that is. The Australian-born designer spent the early part of his career stitching outfits for bands on the run, and his ability to blend that hip, sexy attitude with impeccable tailoring has made him a favorite of women who can afford his four-figure suits.</p><p>His new, lower-priced line, Tyler, is a bid to bring that <em>Almost Famous</em> chic to a larger audience. For spring, he showed cropped jackets nipped in at the waist, lightweight suits, delicate chiffon dresses and full-cut, low-slung trousers in ripply washed silk, paired with camisole tops that showed plenty of skin. While the shapes were simple, the dressmaking details that Tyler loves were abundant: pintucking and bands of ruching, embroidery and lettuce edging. And even in a line meant to be casual, Tyler can't help but revel in the subtle delights of tailoring; for example, he lined one gray silk jacket in a girly floral liberty print and added a fitting strap—the kind of thing usually found in bespoke suits—inside another.</p></div>"
99,spring,2003,s2003,valentino,"Can a lady engage in combat? Can she join up with the sports aficionados? Yes, if she's in the hands of Valentino Garavani. The Roman maestro used a Warhol camouflage print in army greens and browns for a sophisticated wardrobe of snappy short linen military jackets and coats and khaki knit jogging pants with high sandals.</p><p>A lot of designers are in the military/sports zone this season, but the ladies of the Valentino corps are hardly a casual bunch. Their day uniform can consist of an olive jacket inset with brass rings, with the belt threaded through and tied in a knot, or brown leather patterned with mother-of-pearl, or as a bronze lamé safari jacket, all just so.</p><p>For the evening review, it gets even better. Valentino's communiqués from his couture collection show up as delicate metallic-embroidered chiffons made into fragile capes, cardigans or dresses. And for the grand occasion, there's a full battalion of the designer's fabulous signature chiffon gowns.</p></div>"
100,spring,2003,s2003,vera-wang,"Eveningwear is a tough proposition; all too often, it falls into clich¿s of over-the-top glitz and heavy-duty ornament. But it doesn’t have to be that way, as Vera Wang’s beautiful spring show proved.</p><p>Gone were the Edwardian references of Wang’s dramatic, all-black fall collection. Spring’s silhouettes are simple and completely modern: knee-length straight shifts and skirts, tailored trousers and, of course, long gowns. Using a restrained palette of black, taupe and white (with just an occasional shock of vivid color like violet or red to jolt the eye) and luxurious fabrics like silk jersey, chiffon and tulle, Wang created outfits that were simultaneously elegant and youthful, hip and intelligent. She paired a simple black knit top with a whimsical skirt made from tiers of rough, ruffled ivory silk tulle, ran a line of asymmetrical ruching down the front of a strapless black cocktail dress and mixed in careful details like hand-smocking, crochet and occasional short bursts of cascading ruffles.</p><p>There was minimal embellishment, used to maximum impact. A scattering of pea-size glittering glass beads looked like dewdrops against a black pleated chiffon shift, and a pretty red floral chiffon gown had thin streams of lace tracing its seams. Wang added a few lovely daytime pieces, like a white leather coat, a cream organza skirt with a touch of ruching at the side and black wool trousers with white stitching. But her real success with this collection was injecting new life into the night.</p></div>"
101,spring,2003,s2003,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho's work is a form of passive resistance to the onslaught of questionable trends. Others see young women dressing ultrasexy for spring? Really? Branquinho, a young woman herself, simply blanks that out as she continues to explore the idea of quiet strength.</p><p>That doesn't make her a total separatist, though. Her cool form of romanticism has taken fashion's current yen for soft and silky, and run it through fluid, vaguely '40s shapes like bodice-hugging dresses and asymmetrical skirts. There's a delicacy as well to the crisscross straps in her tops or a camisole covered with silver coins.</p><p>She loves to layer—putting a dress over cuffed trousers with leggings—which could be seen as a trifle stifling when bare skin is all around. But then again, summer in Antwerp is a different animal. And where Belgians lead, others have been known to follow.</p></div>"
102,spring,2003,s2003,versace,"What’s Donatella Versace to do when the whole world seems to be going shorter, brighter and more colorful? Do it shorter, brighter, louder and, of course, better. If anyone is perfectly at ease with lime green, magenta, turquoise, yellow and pink, mind-blowing prints, and cuts that go flip-va-boom when a woman moves, it’s Donatella. All that is her birthright, and with this collection she showed the amateurs how it’s done.</p><p>When Amber Valletta came out in a hot-pink short skirt edged with grommets, the hem twelve inches above her knee, it was an iconic blast from the house’s past. But worked in fluid fabrics, the suit had a new feeling, and it was carried throughout the collection. Her brother’s influence is always present, but Donatella has her own confident point of view, which can even mean spelling out her name or adding her initials in gothic lettering on the backs of suits and dresses.</p><p>She evoked Gianni’s traditions with myriad bright, color-blocked-baby-doll and multi-print dresses, and paid him homage with grommet-studded dresses that recalled his great punk collections of the early ’90s. She took the chain mail that he loved for eveningwear and made it into hip camisoles, paired with great-looking skinny, rumpled linen combat pants.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""m95hq7""></div></div><p>Beautiful lingerie dresses were shown in the subtlest nude colors, as well as a black-lace cutout dress that looked like a second skin. The best moment, however, was when the models hit the runway in graphic, paneled cutaway swimsuits and jewel-toned satin cavalier boots. It was a parade worthy of Gianni himself.</p></div>"
103,spring,2003,s2003,versus-versace,"When a Versus junior power vixen stomps in your direction, don't get in her way. She is, after all, a girl who takes her style seriously: she's spent all afternoon locked in the bathroom pumping up her hair, painting her eyelids orange and glossing her lips the color of black vinyl. From New York to London to Tokyo and back, she's a tough girl not to be tampered with.</p><p>For spring, the Versus bad girl is into a gladiator-meets-punk frame of mind. Clashing pink and orange stripes, metallic leathers, bondage straps, shiny red slips and anything in see-through plastic are what she wants—as tight and short as possible. On her way out the door, she'll grab a bag festooned with heavy silver chains. When she heads for the beach, she'll strip down to the briefest-possible lime-green bikini—but take a multicolor-patchwork jean jacket as a cover-up. It's quite a phase she's going through. But then again, what fun!</p></div>"
104,spring,2003,s2003,viktor-rolf,"For spring, the deep-thinking Dutch conceptualists Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren threw off all somber constraints and held a wild dance party on their runway. Dizzy with prints, colors, flowers and ruffles, the show marked a wholly welcome fashion mood swing. Forget angst. Fun is the new avant-garde.</p><p>It was almost as if the designers had invited their models to turn up wearing the sort of party dresses and dinner-dance outfits their mothers might have worn in the late ’60s, that beautiful time when they were teetering on the brink between being ladylike and freaking out. Lots of the dresses, with their tiered pleats and prints, looked straight out of the heyday of Zandra Rhodes and Bill Gibb. Others seemed to pay homage to vintage Chanel, with their black piping on pink, their satin bows and their proper black lace over nude chiffon.</p><p>Viktor &amp; Rolf avoided a flop into retro, though, by adding into the mix some clever replays of their own classics, such as the immaculate tuxedo tailoring and 3-D ruffles that have become their signature. The finale dress, entirely smothered in tulle roses, brought to mind their early, arty days of couture innovation. So what put them in the mood to party? “We’ve been working on our scent, and we wanted something with strong emotion, like being intoxicated by flowers,” Horsting says. “We wanted a softer, more feminine silhouette,” Snoeren adds, “and to loosen up the strict format of fashion shows.”</p></div>"
105,spring,2003,s2003,warren-noronha,"London is not the first city you think of for sexy power dressing. Edginess yes. Shock value often. But it’s a rare British designer who keeps an appreciation of the female form at the forefront of his work. In his fourth season, Warren Noronha has emerged as just such a figure, emphasizing sexiness without ever crossing over into trashiness.</p><p>Noronha knows his way around a curve-enhancing silhouette, scooping out a neckline in a tailored wool dress or fusing a shirt to a low-cut pair of pants in a way that traces every contour. Skinny cropped pants or hip-hugging jeans look good with a strict jacket that melts into an asymmetrical peplum with a waterfall flounce.</p><p>What Noronha is best at, though, is draping jersey. As they stalked the mirrored runway, his models looked—and clearly felt—drop-dead fabulous in body-loving dresses and tops, which came in either black or an abstract print. Ditching the unnecessary theatrics of past seasons, Noronha gave his audience an unobscured view of a talent that is stepping up to the next level.</p></div>"
106,spring,2003,s2003,y-3,"For most of his lengthy and impressive career, Yohji Yamamoto has been aligned with design's avant garde: influential, admired and respected, but never what you might call a big commercial success. Then, a few years ago, footwear giant Adidas asked Yamamoto to design some sneakers. And to almost everyone's surprise, the limited edition (50,000 pairs worldwide) sold out in no time. So earlier this year, Adidas cemented its relationship with Yamamoto, naming him creative director of a new apparel division, Y-3, that the company claims has the potential to become a $300 million business.</p><p>For the label's debut collection, Yamamoto sent out men's and women's looks that focused on sober, simply cut, well-proportioned separates, all ornamented with some variation of the Adidas three-stripe logo. While these clothes might have an athletic heritage, they're not all meant for the body perfect; trousers were fluid, T-shirts and dresses grazed the body and jackets hung loosely from the shoulders. If Adidas's predictions come true, the mainstream is about to get a lot better looking.</p></div>"
107,spring,2003,s2003,yohji-yamamoto,"Yohji Yamamoto jumped an audacious three months ahead of schedule to present his spring ready-to-wear collection the day before the Paris couture shows began. He explained the break with tradition by saying he “wanted to show in silence, with less people.” In this case, those people included Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Azzedine Alaïa, Martine Sitbon and the filmmaker Wim Wenders.</p><p>In the opulent, gilded surroundings of the Paris Opera, Yamamoto unfolded a show that was indeed couture-like—filtered through a modernist sensibility but tinged with a delicate romanticism. He began with royal-blue militaristic jumpsuits topped with army caps, some of which sprouted veils of tulle that referenced the hats of the 1950s. That made way for a parade of tailoring, always in black, which showed the designer’s fascination with discovering new volumes in empire-line jackets and coats with neat raised shoulder lines and portrait necklines. These were brought down to earth with wide pants and pointy, mannish flats.</p><p>It was Yamamoto’s eveningwear, though, that continued the designer’s career-long East-West dialogue—an obsession with the heritage of couture that dates back to a visit he made to Paris as a hungry student in the 1960s. His little black cocktail dresses, with sheer panels in front or back, flowed on the body with a tantalizing, offhand sexiness. His versions of the grand gown came as bustier dresses, sometimes with a twist in the sculpted bodice, anchored here and there with asymmetrically fastened silver chains or bone necklaces.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""b8emn""></div></div><p>On the 20th anniversary of his first Paris show, Yamamoto’s collection was both a confirmation of his stature as a grand master of design, and a testament to his restless, nonconformist questioning of the way things have to be done.</p></div>"
108,spring,2003,s2003,zac-posen,"Zac Posen is entering the make-or-break stage of his career. Is the fortunate 22-year-old just a savvy dilettante whose well-connected friends are happy to wear his offbeat clothes? Or is he truly a major talent, flowering at an enviably early age? New York is hungry for a new star, and the designer’s hype machine has been running full tilt. Produced by fashion's power-PR company, KCD, Posen's show featured hot models (including a rare appearance by Naomi Campbell) and an even hotter front row (Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore).</p><p>But onto the clothes. Posen's chosen aesthetic is ’40s Hollywood, exaggerated and punked-up. He loves to bind the female figure with sculpted strips of cloth that form angular patterns, often with a three-dimensional flourish, at the shoulders and neck. In his fall show, that treatment bordered on camp, but the designer wisely toned it down for spring. The siren dresses aimed at his fabulous friends were still in evidence, but so were soft skirts and pretty printed chiffon blouses, which were clearly meant to send a signal to all the big-league retailers sitting in the front row. Only time will tell whether the designer can continue this evolution, or whether he's a one-trick Posen.</p></div>"
1,fall,2003,f2003,alberta-ferretti,"No one can accuse Alberta Ferretti of being unfocused. Her label’s reputation, whittled down to its essence, is founded on two items: a chiffon dress and a princess coat. And those are exactly—and almost exclusively—what she showed for fall.</p><p>The chiffon dress was short, strappy and pleated. Bound under the bust and at the hip with ribbon, it was shown with opaque colored tights and high patent pumps. The coat, meanwhile, came in color-blocked patent leather and empire-line printed velvet. Ferretti stuck firmly to her chosen colors, running exhaustively through every shade and combination of dusty pink, purple, maroon and red. Toward the end she sent out a few variations in black with feathers, a fringed shimmy dress and, finally, six long versions of the chiffon gown, worn with flat satin slippers.</p><p>There’s no question that Ferretti has a firm handle on her winning signature look. It would have been all the lovelier if her show had been as short as it was sweet.</p></div>"
2,fall,2003,f2003,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Milan's fashion collections seemed to be going in two distinct directions: the warrior women, ready for a melee in their mod revival look, and the quieter types who'd prefer, frankly, to sit on the sidelines with a nice cold cocktail to keep them company. Alessandro Dell'Acqua falls resolutely into camp B, with a Fall collection full of slithery soft fabrics and pale boudoir colors.</p><p>It's not that Dell'Acqua, who also designs for La Perla, was suggesting his customer put her sex appeal on hold; he just wanted to add a little romance along the way. Chiffon tops cascaded over skintight pants, ombre-dyed ostrich feathers fluttered from the top of a halter, and minidresses were of the ruffly and unruly variety. Even when he tried to be serious and severe—as with a series of snug black separates done in satin and velvet—it came off as gently enticing. For those seeking to avoid hard edges in these tough times, Dell'Acqua's soft sell has undeniable appeal.</p></div>"
3,fall,2003,f2003,alexander-mcqueen,"A glass wind-tunnel corridor bridging a snow-covered wasteland: that was the bleak techno-meets-nature setting for Alexander McQueen’s mind trip for fall. “I wanted it to be like a nomadic journey across the tundra,” he said. “A big, desolate space, so that nothing would distract from the work.”</p><p>The clothes, sculpted into his signature nip-waisted, stiff A-line skirt silhouettes, exhibited all the intense craft and some of the shapes that he learned during his stint at Givenchy couture. It bumped his ready-to-wear up to a new level, and if the plot—which traveled through Eurasian ethnic into punk and on to motocross—wasn’t all that understandable, the decorative impact made up for it.</p><p>Fantastic details were lavished on dramatic structured carapaces, embroidered, painted and mind-blowingly embellished to look like antique samurai armor, Russian lacquered dolls and tribal ceremonial dress. Somewhere along the line, the stiff pleated skirts segued into molded suits, done in jigsaws of two-tone checkerboard—the better to show off the designer’s devilishly accurate cutting skills.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""b8vorh""></div></div><p>McQueen can’t resist some theatrics: he sent two models into the wind tunnel, one wearing a skintight leather suit harnessed to a billowing parachute, the other dragging a 20-foot kimono into the eye of the fake snowstorm. Still, the moments that made the audience catch its breath were those that betrayed McQueen’s softer, more romantic side. One was a jacket constructed of white tulle pom-poms that looked like a bubble of snowballs. The other was the prettiest dress in the show: pale gray chiffon cut in an empire shape, embroidered with sequins and worn by Natalia Vodianova with the brightest red ruched over-the-knee boots.</p></div>"
4,fall,2003,f2003,ann-demeulemeester,"On the surface of it, there’s not much change from Ann Demeulemeester for fall. Everything is still black with that lanky, tape-dangling, boot-stomping slouch about it. Demuelemeester’s not about to break into vivid color, crystal strewing or ’60s Cardin references. But then again, who’d want her to?</p><p>Her strong point of view doesn’t necessarily make her a fashion refusenik. Under cover of all that darkness she’s dealing with the main points of the season in her own way. There are skinny pants laced up the leg, which parallel Christian Dior and Helmut Lang, but she cuts them rocker-style in matte oiled cotton. Fashion’s gone layer crazy for fall, and that’s exactly Demeulemeester's thing. No one knows better how to make a cool assemblage of matte gauze T-shirt dresses, leather leggings, distressed biker jackets, satin hip wraps and pieces of tied-on tailoring seem as if it just happened.</p><p>The designer has her own dialogue with the subject of menswear-for-women, too. With their black fedoras, big jackets, pants, shirts and ties done in matte crepe, the models looked like Annie Hall’s goth sisters. The collection didn’t flaunt its familiarity with the trends, but that’s precisely Demeulemeester’s appeal: right-on style by stealth, season after season.</p></div>"
5,fall,2003,f2003,anna-molinari,"Anna Molinari is one of Italy’s suppliers of twentysomething style, a collection that typically picks up on vintage ideas and tweaks them to suit the current mood—but always with a Latin nod toward sexy femininity. No prizes, then, for guessing that the ’60s were the starting point for Rossella Tarabini, the line’s designer (and daughter of its eponymous owner).</p><p>Tarabini took Jane Birkin as inspiration for the collection, which began with an image of a girl in a short, black bouclé Empire coat, banded in fur and worn with high-heeled Mary Janes and thick black stockings. Innocent? Not really. As she moved, she showed a wicked flash of thigh, playing sweet against knowing—and that was the show’s theme in a nutshell. Dresses made from slight, fragile fabrics were worn layered or showed up as a fluttery frill under long, skinny ribbed knits.</p><p>Tarabini dipped into the faded, barely there hues—fugitive shades of lilac, beige and champagne—that are turning up as Milanese favorites. Her structured daywear centered on peacoats and shorts, cropped sailor pants and little fur jackets. For evening, she picked out a ribbon-and-bow motif in diamanté on a charmeuse trapeze, which looked pretty, but then she sent out endless variations on tiered shimmy dresses, which pushed the collection just a fringe too far.</p></div>"
6,fall,2003,f2003,anna-sui,"A veteran flea-market scavenger, Anna Sui is a mixmaster who gives equal weight to thrift-store treasures and fine antiques. The same holds true for her collections, where she tosses decades and movements together with gusto.</p><p>While many designers have zeroed in on the mid-’60s mod aesthetic this season, Sui focused instead on the end of that decade, specifically the London boutique Biba and its art deco motifs and girlish, narrow-cut fashions. She sent out sweet little dresses in lace or printed chiffon with fluttery handkerchief hems, body-hugging cardigans, slim harlequin-pattern jerseys, and popcorn-knit sweaters in muted plums, browns and greens. But like a juggler itching for a challenge, Sui upped the ante by tossing in another decade—the ’70s, which showed up in patchwork quilted parkas, anoraks and a group of ski pants paired (confusingly) with beaded chiffon tops. It was a lot to handle, but Sui is a confident fashion deejay, and in her hands it all became cheerful, noisy fun.</p></div>"
7,fall,2003,f2003,anne-klein,"Anne Klein designer Charles Nolan picked up the early-’60s mood that’s been sweeping through the collections this week, citing references from Jackie Kennedy to Antonioni to the house’s own founding designer.</p><p>For one thing, that meant hemlines zoomed well above the knee; fully three quarters of the looks Nolan sent out were minis, from swingy kilts to leather A-line looks to sporty, rugby-striped versions. He paired them with slim ribbed turtlenecks, popcorn-bedecked sweaters, crisp shirts and silky geometric-print blouses. There were a few pantsuits with trim, short jackets topping slim, tab-waisted trousers. While minis are generally aimed at the younger set, Nolan’s restrained colors made the collection mature: plummy browns, black, ivory, white, navy and gray, with jolts of orange and blue. And he made sure to give his grown-up customer a bit of luxe, via combinations like a black mink anorak worn over a black leather mini.</p><p>For evening, Nolan moved his inspiration back even farther, to the flapper era. He showed short, beaded and sequined shifts, one topped with a pretty ivory satin evening coat. How short his customer will really go, of course, remains to be seen. But should she decide to raise high her hemlines, Anne Klein gives her an adult alternative.</p></div>"
8,fall,2003,f2003,badgley-mischka,"Mark Badgley and James Mischka keep alive the tradition of occasion dressing, designing entrance-making gowns for red carpets and gala benefits. Their shows are more about variations on a theme than about surprise, and they stayed true to form for fall, with a palette out of a wine-lover’s dream. Beaded and satin dresses, both short and long, came in colors like claret, bordeaux, cognac, plum, rose and lilac. A deco style was much in evidence, most successfully in the sliplike satin gown worn by Eva Herzigova to close the proceedings. Badgley Mischka also scored with the ""plucked"" mink coats and jackets that appeared throughout, though it's probably best to leave the lamé leg warmers at home.</p></div>"
9,fall,2003,f2003,balenciaga,"Nicolas Ghesquière decided to show his fall collection in New York rather than his home base of Paris. And given the terror alerts, bloodless economy, looming war and frigid winter the city is enduring, the timing for his broody, sexy presentation couldn’t have been better. Ghesquière held the show in a severely minimalist art gallery (with an audience that included two of Hollywood’s darker starlets, Chloë Sevigny and Asia Argento), the better to focus attention on the intriguing shapes, fabrics and colors.</p><p>There aren’t many who play as fearlessly with proportion as Ghesquière, and in this collection he staked out two strong silhouettes: First came slim trapeze looks, like a spare black tunic coat over white leggings and a pretty mint-colored sweater; then he sent out a modern hourglass, made by way of jackets and tops cut with balloon sleeves and often cropped at midtorso. Worn over skintight pants or derrière-hugging minis (including one witty version that looked like a kilt caught in a wind tunnel), it was sleek, tough and cleverly sexy—the kind of uniform a secret agent might wear in <em>Matrix: Reloaded.</em></p><p>The designer’s fabrics, substantial and with surface interest, demanded their own attention: chunky shearling, nubby wool felt, ribbed jersey and slick nylon. Chiffon turned up in a few evanescent pink and white tops, sewn with meandering ruffles and brought down to earth by glossy gray thigh boots. Ghesquière excels at pushing his medium to its limit, as shown in the variations he did on his beloved patchwork pieces. But he’s also a master of the classics who can toss off a perfectly cut black blazer to take its wearer through any crisis in style.</p></div>"
10,fall,2003,f2003,bcbg-max-azria,"Who is the BCBG girl? For the past few seasons her identity has been murky at best, but this season she seems to have hit her stride. Music maven Michael Gaubert hinted that ""she's groovy"" when he opened the show with White Sport's song of the same name, and Max Azria's clothes lived up the soundtrack. Curbing his enthusiasm for chiffon in favor of canvas, corduroy and cotton twill, Azria showed a series of solid, workwear-inspired jackets and coats with interesting pockets and decorative studs. These smart basics were shown with more romantic and, yes, floaty, blouses and dresses, some of which referenced the ’30s by way of the disco ’70s.</p><p>Who is the BCBG girl? She's young and yes, this season she's even a bit groovy.</p></div>"
11,fall,2003,f2003,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour’s fall show was full of self-conscious references—to everything from sewing patterns to dressmaking dummies—that only a fashion insider could recognize. But even the most casual observer will appreciate the collection’s subtle charm and clean cuts.</p><p>Sarafpour sent out elegant little dresses and jackets whose brass zippers were intentionally left uncovered as decoration, and a camel coat with the darts and shoulder pads picked out in black. She also picked up on the retro trend flowing through this season, exploring a late-’50s feel via coats and jackets with three-quarter sleeves worn over slim skirts or toreador pants. This is a designer with a witty sense of scale—and who knows when to use it. Last season, for example, she played with exploding sunburst tie-dye; this time, it was fox-fur collars the size of kiddie pools and lacy sweaters crocheted in extra-bulky ivory yarn.</p><p>The gold brocade the designer used for a few skirts and tops has shown up on too many other runways to look new, but Sarafpour’s disciplined cutting made it simple and appealing. And if some of her pieces were a little overworked—like a tulle ball skirt topped by a beige horsehair bodice—the collection as a whole had an appealing sense of gentle, intelligent experimentation.</p></div>"
12,fall,2003,f2003,betsey-johnson,"A little bubblegum, a little bondage, a lot of cheerfully trashy clothes—yes, Betsey Johnson is back. After an extended break following her 60th birthday last summer, the designer has banished all thoughts of retirement and instead redoubled her efforts, launching a new line called Betseyville.</p><p>Johnson recently bought a vacation house in Mexico, and fiesta is clearly on her mind. She opened the show by sending out a group of twirling models wearing sweeping tiered skirts and tiny tourist T-shirts, and she followed these with another 80 or so outfits that ranged from biker looks to first-communion dresses. Showing women's and men's wear and both her lines (Betseyville is primarily denims and T-shirts) in a color palette that could only be described as kaleidoscopic, Johnson offered up something for good-humored consumers of every stripe. Granted, not every girl will be able to wear the bikini top no bigger than a headband, or the teeny denim minis, but a flowery crocheted sweater or a floaty chiffon dress will certainly bring a breath of fresh air to a moribund closet. Among the best pieces: crocheted sweaters, skinny cigarette jeans, chevron-striped sweater dresses and the aforementioned chiffons.</p></div>"
13,fall,2003,f2003,bill-blass,"Lars Nilsson continues to put his imprint on the house of Bill Blass, merging his own intellectual and artistic impulses with the spirit of one of America’s most influential design names.</p><p>In the two years since Nilsson became the house’s creative director, he’s made it clear that he loves sophisticated color combinations and traditional handcrafts, using them to give new life to the elegant sportswear that Blass’s customer craves. For fall, he put some dazzling hues on the runway, starting with a group of piney-green separates that included a dyed sable coat. He sent out a scarlet satin shirt and wool skirt that radiated its own heat and a creamy ivory jacket cut like a duffel coat worn over honey-colored suede trousers. The handwork showed up on an inky blue coat, embroidered with silver and worn over a navy satin skirt and black cashmere sweater.</p><p>Nilsson showed a few looks that echoed the founder's delight in irreverent juxtapositions: a motorcycle jacket cut in black satin, for example, or a simple hip-length sweater worn with a chiffon and lamé skirt for an easy nighttime look. There were prime examples, too, of the American designer tradition that sees no shame in luxurious practicality; a black cotton twill parka with a black sable hood, for example, or a navy velvet jacket that works for daytime or as an evening piece.</p></div>"
14,fall,2003,f2003,blaak,"With a sudden <em>kerranng!</em> of heavy-metal energy, Blaak woke up the London scene with a show that proved that not all young Brit designers are sleepwalking back to the ’60s. Stomping out in a gray denim flying suit with punky black-banded zones of cross-laced tapes running up and down her body, Blaak’s first model struck a rebel pose, and the collection was on a roll.</p><p>Designers Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif picked up the sport/utilty track where they left it off last season, but zipped up the action with some rock-star attitude for a collection called Electric Collision. They used contrasting washed-satin and mesh fabrics, chemical-dyed denim and metallic-shot silk to give the aviator look a streetwise workout. Best of all—in a season when many have played it safe with black—they kept the faith with color, using shades of raspberry, turquoise, royal blue and silver. When Okada described the theme of the show as “cosmonauts meet crusaders,” it didn’t illuminate much; but the idea of designing for “a strong woman” hit a refreshing note in a London season that has often seemed to equate youth with passivity.</p></div>"
15,fall,2003,f2003,boudicca,"Extraordinary cut. Dramatic silhouettes. The sound of an audience bursting into spontaneous applause after an atmospheric build-up. Sounds like the good old London we used to know. It took Boudicca, the reclusive East End–based duo, to stir up the city to a level of excitement that’s been mourned since Alexander McQueen departed for Paris. Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby’s collection, crafted entirely in black with the exception of one dress, was a beautifully considered sequence of darkly feminine glamour, with extra sparkle provided by the original use of Swarovski crystals.</p><p>Boudicca is not an overnight student phenomenon, and that’s a good thing. Shaking off a five-season reputation for cryptic presentations in dank venues, Broach and Kirkby seized their debut appearance in the official British Fashion Council tent as an opportunity to hold their talent up to the light for the first time. What was revealed had an accomplished, distinctive, sometimes couture-like quality that showed through in striking lace dresses, taffeta skirts with deep knife-pleat flounces, slithery asymmetric jersey, deluxe blousons and puffy down jackets.</p><p>The detailing showed all the ingenuity and skill of a couple who have devoted years to questioning and refining their vision. Dresses often came overlaid with lace tied on like an apron; skirts were crisscrossed with ribbon in back or exploded at the hem with extravagant godets, one decorated with giant black silk roses. Amid all the layers of black, the models’ limbs and faces were adorned with crystal transfers, an effect building to a finale of a girl who appeared in a sparkling silver jacket and headpiece. And that was when Boudicca won the London season’s first ovation.</p></div>"
16,fall,2003,f2003,burberry-prorsum,"At the age of 30, Christopher Bailey is the creative director of one of the largest and most broadly based fashion brands in the world. He shoulders the responsibility for making Burberry’s many product lines both cool enough for hipsters and classic enough for conservatives, a balancing act that he carries out with almost preternatural maturity. Yet his being only 30 may explain why his Fall collection for Burberry Prorsum, the house’s designer collection, was shot through with flashbacks to the 1980s. He is, after all, a child of that decade.</p><p>Bailey wisely dispensed with forced references to the Burberry plaid (been there, done that) while making rainwear a link through the show. A printed nylon mac was humorously patterned with an English country scene—including a cartoon of the Burberry horseman logo—which, he said, had been drawn up in the studio. The label’s weatherproof reputation was preserved, thanks to an acid-yellow parka, a slick black rain poncho and matte-black leather trenches, accessorized with bright bags featuring flaps to contain matching umbrellas.</p><p>The ’80s references came via searing shots of color—leaf green, mint, royal blue, apricot and yellow—and a penchant for jersey leggings. There were plenty of the neat little jackets, in washed cottons and puffy leather, that Bailey does so well. He also layered on raw-edged, crinkled stretch-chiffon wrap dresses, and he came up with some cool sweaters in contrasting blocks of New Age stripes. After that, it got a bit puzzling.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""r1ithh""></div></div><p>Why the strange cuts with the raised, inside-out seaming? And why not some more stuff for the grown-ups? Overall, the collection did not come off as fully resolved. On the other hand, Bailey’s heart is in the right place. After the show, he said he “wanted energy, color, something to make people feel better.” And we can all relate to that.</p></div>"
17,fall,2003,f2003,calvin-klein-collection,"It seemed like just another pre-show melee at Calvin Klein’s Friday afternoon presentation: packs of photographers jostling to get shots of Hilary Swank, Renée Zellweger and Clare Danes as editors and retailers milled sociably. But in fact there was a sea change taking place: That day, the designer officially closed the $430 million deal to sell the company he and partner Barry Schwartz started 35 years ago to Philips-Van Heusen. Klein claims he’s going to help the new owners build his name into a billion-dollar megabrand—but that’s a world of shoe and underwear licenses, not designer sportswear. And whether he’ll still have the appetite to do a collection every six months remains to be seen.</p><p>His fall collection read like a mixed reaction. There were classic Klein touches—that gracefully minimalist cut, in perfectly fitting slim trousers and neat wool flannel jackets with firmly squared-off shoulders and whip-thin leather belts. He showed plenty of dresses, many sleeveless and cut with a flirty little flounce just above the knee. And as might be expected from a man who started as a coat designer, there was good-looking outerwear: a boxy wool bouclé style, a black shearling baseball jacket as plush as a teddy bear, sleek black leathers and supple cashmeres. But there were elements that didn’t compute, like an odd red-green-gold abstract print, poufy bubble skirts and—given his obvious appeal to the Hollywood contingent—a disappointing absence of the glamorously simple eveningwear he’s offered up in the past.</p></div>"
18,fall,2003,f2003,capucci,"The idea of a grand, retired, old-world Roman couturier collaborating with a wayward young tyke of the Belgian school may sound like a scheme from the far realms of fashion improbability. But as of this season it’s a reality. The Capucci collection, launched for Fall in Milan, is a start-up project that has brought in Bernhard Willhelm to reinterpret the work of the label’s revered founder, Roberto Capucci.</p><p>The difference between this and many another revival of a defunct fashion house is that Capucci is alive, spry and actively involved in the enterprise at the age of 74. Another twist is that Willhelm is only the first of the young designers who will be involved; next season his contributions will be shown alongside those of Tara Subkoff, of Imitation of Christ, and the Spanish designer Sybilla.</p><p>Never a conformist to the fashion system, Capucci had a reputation as a genius sculptor of fabric who showed his collections not according to the season but when the inspiration moved him. Backed by the heavyweight Italian fashion industrialists Franco Bruccoleri, Franco Pene and Aldo Palmeri, he’s now aiming to introduce a new generation to his name and legacy. “The world changes. There are no more balls or women who can come for five fittings for a dress,” he says. “This is a new adventure. I want to see how young designers could carry on the spirit of what I do with a new attitude.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""1rqchj""></div></div><p>After being invited by Capucci to immerse himself in the house’s archive of 30,000 designs, Willhelm emerged with the core of a small collection that merges street fashion and couture construction. Head-turning items included a gargantuan down parka with vast, puffy leg-of-mutton sleeves and a gray bat-winged sweatshirt cardigan that falls into tails at the back. It looked like the intriguing start of a project that will get into full swing next season. Watch this space.</p></div>"
19,fall,2003,f2003,carolina-herrera,"In an era when sex appeal seems mostly to be about big displays of flash and flesh, Carolina Herrera sent out a coolly appealing collection that made a case for subtly seductive elegance.</p><p>Satin is one of the season’s most important fabrics, and Herrera’s were some of the most beautiful so far—mouth-watering, fluid blouses and skirts in richly pigmented blues, burgundy, gray and creamy white. She paired those pieces with slim pencil skirts and tailored trousers and topped some with buttery, light Persian lamb coats and jackets or swingy sables. Elegantly tailored suits and coats never got too serious, thanks to a body-hugging cut and soft colors like dove gray or toffee.</p><p>The Herrera woman has a packed social schedule, of course, which calls for a few evening looks. If she's feeling flirty, she'll grab one of the designer’s bouncy ball skirts edged in feathers. Would-be sirens, meanwhile, will find that her slinky, body-skimming gowns flatter both their assets and their intelligence.</p></div>"
20,fall,2003,f2003,celine,"Wondering where the wild things are? The answer, at least this season, is on the runway at Celine.</p><p>Michael Kors showed sequined zebra-striped bustier dresses, giraffe spots on pony bags, silver crocodile miniskirts and jackets, mink boleros and dramatic over-the-ear bonnets in Saga fox fur. But if the prints and pelts were straight out of the wilderness, the collection was most definitely designed for the urban jungle. The silhouette was neat, slim and dangerously short, while the palette was almost entirely black and white, with plenty of Chrysler Building-at-sunset sparkle. The clothes had a tough big-city-after-dark edge, with sharp silver zippers snaking their way up the back of second-skin pants, chains hanging from otherwise ladylike structured handbags, and white leather coats shot through with grommets.</p><p>Has the Celine woman morphed into Debbie Harry circa 1981? Most definitely not. This was punk done for girls with clean hair and Birkin bags—the same sort of women who will appreciate Kors’s swingy <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em> satin trench coats and ice-blue fox puffer jackets.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""yo0a79""></div></div><p>The uptown/downtown clash could be seen most clearly in the shoes: sky-high square-toe stilettos with oversize silver Pilgrim buckles, which Kors described as “ladylike from the front and nasty from the back.” “It’s all about contradiction,” he said of the collection. “It’s a good girl gone bad or a bad girl gone good. I’m still trying to figure out which.”</p></div>"
21,fall,2003,f2003,chalayan,"Is it possible that Hussein Chalayan is thinking the same way everyone else is? For fall he showed small, drapey cutaway dresses; skinny, skinny pants; and some great utility/patchwork jackets and coats, decorated with embroidery and zippers. Add in a miniskirt with D-ring garter tabs, glove-leather formfitting dresses and high heels, and the descriptions begin to read like a roundup of the season’s most important fashion headlines.</p><p>As always, though, the genius is in the execution. Chalayan came at these ideas from his own distinctive direction, elevating the collection above mere trendiness. For several seasons he’s been influential in cutting abstract layers into clothing and superimposing elements of ethnicwear onto urban materials. Now all that experimentalism has come together to form cool, downright wantable stuff. Dresses, jackets and coats came with pieced-in jigsaws of plaid, zones of military drab, the odd patch of shearling and fragments of olive branch–patterned embroideries derived from Turkish folk costume. Sound complicated? It wasn’t. “It looks much less conceptual,” beamed Julie Gilhart, fashion director of Barneys New York, after the show. “The jackets and miniskirts are great.”</p><p>Nevertheless, the burden of Chalayan’s allusions is impossible to ignore. His complex performance-art presentation plumbed the foreboding imagery of religious guilt and impending war but ended with a group of girls popping open inflatable pockets as they stood next to a wooden boatlike installation. The designer said it symbolized Noah’s Ark: hope for humanity after the deluge.</p></div>"
22,fall,2003,f2003,chanel,"For fall, Karl Lagerfeld showed graphic, rechopped teeny-weeny Chanel suits that, he said, were inspired by the work of Russian constructivist painter Kasimir Malevich. Girls won’t need an art-history class to get the idea, though: it’s all about a short double-layered A-line skirt (no longer than fingertip length), a minute tight-sleeved shrunken jacket, black blocked against white and a whole lot of funky leg action.</p><p>Starting from that basis, Lagerfeld mixed things up with his usual polymath flair. The addition of slick black leather leg warmers and gauntlets meant the suit came over a bit biker chic; with white boots, it said space-age; and when he let a little lace peep from the pelmet, the tiny two-piece looked fully in touch with fall’s pretty femininity.</p><p>The decorative vibe ran through the collection: purple tweed was edged with ruffles, a pastel suit was outlined with furry loops of wool, and tougher plaited leather pieces were connected with fragile zones of tulle. Details took the form of white rabbit-fur collars embedded with white jet, oversize silver chains studded with porcelain beads, high boots and a slew of puns on the tools of the trade—exposed zippers, necklaces made of huge snaps, and spirals of hooks and eyes winding around dresses.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""phk0nj""></div></div><p>In the middle of all this, Lagerfeld staged a ski moment for the house's entire family, sending out Pat Cleveland with her children, Anna and Noel Van Ravenstein, in double-C down jackets and boots. In other words, all the usual playfulness of Chanel ready-to-wear was there, done with a light-handed touch that underscored Coco's legacy of flexibility—and fun— in the reign of King Karl.</p></div>"
23,fall,2003,f2003,chloe,"Chloé may be celebrating her 45th birthday, but she looks about 27 with London girl Phoebe Philo in charge. Philo projects her own mixed-up vintage-meets-sexy-streetwear look onto the clothes, which is fine as long as she polishes things up to the Paris mark. Never one to wax philosophical about the fun of getting dressed, the designer uttered nothing more about the collection than: ""What can I say? It was a little bit of everything I love doing thrown in there.""</p><p>Thrown in there was exactly right. What Philo appears to be loving right now included cascading ruffly chiffon, Zandra Rhodes-style; Alaïa-ish short black flounce skirts; bad-taste eighties animal-print poncho dresses; thick, orange woolly tights; and suede thigh boots. That's not to say that she didn't send plenty of the house classics down the runway, too. There were soft frocks (the staple on which Chloé built its reputation in the sixties and seventies), in a poppy print with a tie-back waistline, and a flippy two-tiered skirt. The classic girl-about-town navy coat came styled with a hoodie underneath, and jeans (unseen here since Stella McCartney moved on) made a comeback, skintight and with poppies appliquéd to the derriere and other strategic spots. A military shirt sleekly tucked into well-cut matching pants inspired a round of applause.</p><p>What was missing , though, was the coherence of Philo's first few outings at Chloé. There was no graspable theme, as in Brigitte Bardot in Saint-Tropez and Keith Richards at Altamont of earlier seasons. It's not that fashion needs a narrative to be interesting, but a strand of identifying, connecting thought is what helps lift things above the level of nice clothes on a rack.</p></div>"
24,fall,2003,f2003,christian-dior,"Only one man on earth could possibly whip up a collection of fetish queens in Kabuki face paint, going crazy in multicolor Asian-slash-eighteenth-century clothes. Hello, John Galliano! Up to his canny method madness at Christian Dior yet again.</p><p>“It was hard-core romance! Sex robots!” was the sound bite Galliano delivered backstage to describe his ready-to-wear version of the conceptual mayhem he wreaked at Dior’s couture collection in January. Back then he’d just come back from a trip to China and Japan, scandalizing many critics with the extra-outsize scale of his box-shaped, 3-D cutting experiments and mind-blowing kaleidoscope of East-West references.</p><p>But now we see how it all trickles down to the level of wearable, wantable clothes. Take a pink, crystal-embroidered duchesse-satin coat, extravagantly ruffled with layers of organza, or a fragile chiffon dress patterned in mint, yellow and magenta—who wouldn’t? Rubber leggings, cross-laced up the front, came with a peach-colored, gold-embroidered satin jacket, edged with a multilayer explosion of organza ruffles. A massive fur in three shades of lilac rode on a tiny, slinky minidress. The stripes and numbers of football jerseys got thrown onto wispy chiffon; the black-and-white fish prints from Chinese kites were dramatized into voluminous gowns. This was a collection studded with innumerable delicate, richly beautiful pieces.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""iirvsm""></div></div><p>Above all, the wearability factor is proven by Dior’s results. For those turned on by financials, the house just announced operating profits of $36 million for the last season. Meanwhile, Galliano fanatic Gwen Stefani displayed her own enthusiasm for the Dior bottom line. “Just how do I get my ass into that rubber skirt?” she wanted to know.</p></div>"
25,fall,2003,f2003,clements-ribeiro,"Showing in their hometown for the first time since September 2001, Clements Ribeiro was warmly welcomed back to London as a small sign that Paris is not, perhaps, the absolute pinnacle of designer ambition. They made their comeback, however, whistling a Frenchified tune, inspired by Jane Birkin and the inevitable ’60s. That meant an opening of a little cream jumper dress over a gray turtleneck, a princess-line tweed coat and an oversize striped cashmere sweater masquerading as a dress. Clearly, the <em>jeune-fille</em> Parisian mood of their Cacharel consultancy has left its mark.</p><p>Suzanne Clements said that the duo’s decision to show in Paris had been a purely pragmatic move—to get seen in the season of the 9/11 crisis—and that the reason for their return was to give her and her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, more time between staging their own presentation and the Cacharel collection. The trouble is that, as fashion moves on at its breakneck pace, you don’t ever get to go back to where you started from.</p><p>Clements Ribeiro shone at the moment when cashmere knitwear was reborn as a fashion vehicle. Their infinitely varied striped or wittily patterned sweaters virtually redefined the category, beginning a worldwide economic cycle that peaked at the turn of the millennium. Wisely, they are still turning out the knits that made their name, in pale pastel patterns and variously banded stripes, but it’s hard to recapture the original excitement. Instead, the pair concentrated on Bermuda-shorts suits, swirly multicolor prints and high-waisted A-line frocks and coats. It went with the flow of the trend nicely enough, but it didn’t chart any new territory.</p></div>"
26,fall,2003,f2003,comme-des-garcons,"Rei Kawakubo is a lone traveler on an aesthetic journey, during which she occasionally throws out oblique reflections on the state of the world. For Fall, Kawakubo sees her woman quite literally as a person in transit, walking toward her destination with what look like bundles of possessions slung about her body. In one sense, the designer arrived at those tied-on fabric slings and knapsacks by developing the bunchy forms that were knotted into her Spring collection. Now, though, they’ve acquired different associations, which, Kawakubo said, emerged from the idea of a pilgrimage.</p><p>Oddly enough, that idea didn’t send her collection wandering too far off the beaten track. Returning to work with her beloved tartans, Kawakubo created jackets and pantsuits that addressed the subject of traditional menswear from a different angle. Platform-soled loafers had the rock-and-roll cool of brothel creepers, while molded rubber Wellingtons had the air of biker boots about them.</p><p>Kawakubo doesn’t usually spell out her political beliefs, but this collection included a section of printed fabrics bearing slogans standing up for individualistic thinking. One was Kierkegaard’s “The majority is always wrong,” supplemented by a couple of one-liners written by the designer’s collaborator Gene Krell: “Conformity is the language of corruption” and “Viva the one-percenters.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""uhblo""></div></div><p>The last pilgrim exited the show wrapped in a flaglike cloak, pieced together in the form of a black cross. Though Kawakubo said the religious symbolism was coincidental, the image was disturbingly poignant.</p></div>"
27,fall,2003,f2003,costume-national,"Sleek, dark, graphic, sexy. For Fall 2003, Costume National designer Ennio Capasa did more of what he does best. Sensual silk dresses slunk their way down the models’ shoulders as they walked. Curve-hugging overcoats featured kinky corset bones and lingerie lacing. Skirts and dresses were short enough to cause serious gawking, if not a Fifth Avenue fender bender. Capasa’s love for noir was much in evidence—there was black leather, ebony jersey, deep-charcoal jacquard, and midnight mink—but shots of Easter-candy violet and deep peony pink provided welcome points of light.</p><p>At its strongest, the collection, which Capasa named “Digital Beauty,” gives modern urban women more of what they need (or, at least, want)—slim jackets, A-line skirts, printed dresses, great black pants. But at times the clothes crossed the line from chic and modern to futuristic and far-fetched. Stretch-leather jumpsuits, which fit like a latex glove, are perhaps best left to actual digital beauties like <em>Tomb Raider</em>’s Lara Croft.</p></div>"
28,fall,2003,f2003,d-g,"Important client lunch? Electroclash rave? Eighties night down at the local dive bar? D&amp;G has them all covered, with a far-reaching collection that mixes the brash sexiness of its parent and its own youthful verve.</p><p>For its fall show, D&amp;G brought in British DJ Princess Superstar and planted her, turntables and all, in the middle of the runway. It must have felt just like another night in the club, as troops of women and men streamed past her in outfits ranging from absolutely-proper business wear (slim, sexy dresses with jackets, pantsuits, crisp shirts) to New Romantic/punk combinations—huge, dripping-off-the-shoulder blouses, miniskirts and pants so tight they should be reclassified as hosiery. The rollicking neo-Edwardian and pirate-y looks recalled Vivienne Westwood's outfits for Adam Ant, while graffiti-printed neon-bright pieces seemed to be desperately looking for someone named Susan. It was a cheerful, fast-paced look at the closet of a woman whose motto could be ""life's a VIP list and I'm on it.""</p></div>"
29,fall,2003,f2003,diane-von-furstenberg,"The Bond girl is a touchstone of twentieth-century fashion, outlasting momentary trends and providing a beacon of sexy stylishness that shines across the decades. For fall, Diane von Furstenberg and her creative director, Nathan Jenden, took this pop-culture icon as their departure point, creating a wardrobe equally suited to seducing spies, battling criminal masterminds or sipping cocktails at sunset.</p><p>The presentation began with von Furstenberg's own icon—the wrap jersey dress—rethought in a shorter, asymmetrical cut. Then came simple pantsuits, filmy printed chiffons and slithery evening dresses with plunging necklines. Intriguingly mismatched color combinations—peach with rust, pink with brown and blue—gave the show a distinctly '70s flavor, while the breadth of the collection means Bondettes of all stripes will find something to suit them. Daredevils will go for the giddy peacock-blue velvet minidress; double agents will slip by in the ladylike white flannel coat; and undercover types will cozy up to the rainbow-hued fringed sweater worn over skintight jeans.</p></div>"
30,fall,2003,f2003,dkny,"Schoolgirls and career women, preppies and punks, party girls and artsy types—they all converged on the runway at DKNY, where Donna Karan aimed to reflect the sidewalk society of her beloved New York City.</p><p>Of course, Karan’s sidewalks are undeniably better-dressed than most. Her schoolgirl uniform, for example, is a neat fitted navy jacket over a crisp white shirt and flirty grey flannel skirt short enough to shock a nun. And the world would be a prettier place if more 9-to-5 types wore some of Karan's lovely, colorful outerwear, like the scarlet wool zipped coat or the soft, honey-colored mohair version. Even the downtown crowd that calls its own style shots could benefit from a pair of skinny black pants with just enough zippers to be hip (but not enough to be scary), or her black sweater with its chain-mail sleeves. There were plenty of other easily approachable items, like skinny Glen-plaid pants, black tuxedo jackets, fuzzy mohair sweaters and silky little skirts. Part of the delight came from the pretty, atypical fall colors—mint green, hot pink, gold, lavender, red—that made the collection distinct and different.</p><p>Karan uses the DKNY line almost as a sketch pad, a place where she dashes off ideas and trends that, for whatever reason, catch her eye. This season, that approach gave the collection an easy, casual charm that was hard to resist.</p></div>"
31,fall,2003,f2003,dolce-gabbana,"Dolce &amp; Gabbana idolizes supermodel royalty, and their show had a roster full: Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Amber Valletta and Eva Herzigova were all there, underscoring the longevity of a look the designers first established in the late ’80s. Evangelista opened the show in a bright tangerine parka slung over one of the duo's signature pieces, the black corset dress. It was a combo that stated a general theme, which Stefano Gabbana described as ""techno romance.""</p><p>That meant that pop color—acid yellow, orange, emerald and royal blue—flashed through the collection in shoes, bags and down jackets laden with utility straps and clips. But even if they play up an effervescent moment with details like necklaces made of bottle tops or CDs, or a shot of brash gold lamé, these guys know better than to neglect what they do best. Year after year Dolce &amp; Gabbana's mannish suits and shapely dresses keep women coming back, and they'd never let a passing trend distract from that.</p><p>In a season when menswear is a rising trend, Dolce &amp; Gabbana's pantsuits and shirting looked bang-on relevant. They redrafted the proportions to create new shoulder volume, sometimes slipping a pinstripe bolero or a jacket cut like a kimono over waist-clinching tailoring. White shirts looked great tied with a flourish in front to reemphasize the expert tease of their masculine/feminine styling.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""hkpxmp""></div></div><p>For evening, they issued updates on the corset-tight sheaths they've been doing forever, one in a ruched satin rose print, another in black lace, followed by a finale of enough showgirl fringed sparkle and spangled nude tulle to dress the entire cast of <em>Chicago.</em> This is a collection celebrating house classics. And no wonder: Dolce &amp; Gabbana have just opened a whole new business, here at 26 Via della Spiga, devoted to selling remade editions of their greatest vintage hits.</p></div>"
32,fall,2003,f2003,donna-karan,"Being acquired is never easy, and Donna Karan has had some bumpy moments in the two years since French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH bought her company. In a nutshell, she’s Dharma and they’re Greg. But under her free-spirited, New Age exterior is a true Seventh Avenue businesswoman who doesn’t let a few challenges get in her way.</p><p>With her boss (LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, in a rare U.S. appearance) and a fresh crop of company executives sitting in the front row, Karan sent out a sensuous, assertive collection that included references to her own groundbreaking designs of two decades ago. Wool jersey—a fabric to which Karan laid claim from the start of her career—started the show, made into cat suits and skintight dresses inset with silver rings made by her old friend Robert Lee Morris. Karan has famously shed weight on a raw-foods-and-yoga regime, and her renewed love of a long, lean figure was evident. She put emphasis on the midriff, tailoring jackets like corsets to hug the body, wrapping coats and dresses with shiny black leather obis and cutting pants high and tight on the waist. Some of the outerwear pieces, done in loamy brown or ivory cashmere tweeds, creamy goatskin or nubby stretch wool touched with patent leather, were cut along classic fit-and-flare lines; others were done in generous kimono styles that slouched off the body. The designer also played with sequins, tossing a few onto tweed separates, mixing others with suede on a funky beige dress.</p><p>The body beautiful got even more so for evening, as Karan showed a series of goddess-like silk jersey dresses in black or ivory, pulled and draped, with more of Morris’s silver rings. Altogether, it was a solid defense of Karan’s signature thesis—that power dressing and sex appeal can, like Dharma and Greg, go hand in hand.</p></div>"
33,fall,2003,f2003,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten is not one for following trends. There are times when his soft, rich bohemian aesthetic fits in with the rest of what’s happening, and there are times—like now, as a ’60s mod–meets–’80s disco look is ruling the runways—when it doesn’t. It’s not a problem for the Van Noten customer, who likes to collect individual pieces rather than change her look every season. Come fall, she'll have plenty of beautiful options to choose from.</p><p>Shown under a canopy of tiny fairy lights, Van Noten’s collection was hugely feminine and adorned with everything from sequined edges and ruffled hems to floral appliqu¿. As always, the clothes had a subtle ethnic flavor—Chinese floral-print jackets, tops that wrap like kimonos, and sari embroidery on lush, long scarves. But this season the designer also did a little time traveling. Flapper coats and twinkling capelets had a distinctively ’20s feel; drapey layers (homey shawls over coats over sweaters over long skirts) would not have been out of place at an ERA rally; and fur tippets brought to mind the sort of 1940s lady who wouldn’t dream of leaving the house without gloves. Everything had a well-loved feel, like a beautiful old couture piece rediscovered in a closet and worn with a striped cotton pajama top or a deliciously nubby sweater.</p><p>Backstage after the show, Van Noten said he’d been going for a dreamy mood. “You can think about fashion and try to figure out what’s hip, but I don’t think it’s a time for that right now,” he said. “I just wanted to do something beautiful, to create a fairy-tale collection.” In that he certainly succeeded.</p></div>"
34,fall,2003,f2003,emanuel-ungaro,"Some sort of fairy tale on ice unfolded on the circular runway at Emanuel Ungaro. Crunching her way across the crystal-strewn floor, the heroine had a look all her own: pale, drifty layerings of gossamer, worn over sparkly Lurex-shot leggings and high heels.</p><p>By mixing up the fluttery, ruffle-edged printed chiffon with sporty pieces like jersey tanks, big parkas, hoodies and funked-up fur, Giambattista Valli managed to skate clear of the cloying sweetness that sometimes threatens to drown this collection. Valli also turned down the volume on the vibrant Ungaro palette, using subtle layers of grays, bois de rose and greige, interspersed with sparkles of silver and gold lamé. The tops and dresses, with their rippling transparent frills, poet sleeves and flounces were in step with the casual, falling-off-the-shoulder look, and the leggings added the essential kicker to make it all current. Best in show? The casually decorative, tufty gray rabbit furs implanted with trailing chiffon ribbons and some sexy reworkings of the house's signature smoking jackets, cut with draped sleeves.</p><p>The 36-year-old Valli is making all the right modernizing moves at Ungaro—with one caveat. Fairy tales that go on too long send people to sleep. Next season he needs to take scissors to the plot.</p></div>"
35,fall,2003,f2003,emilio-pucci,"Pucci’s bright swirly prints and high spirits belong in the sun—whether that’s on beaches in summer or at ski resorts in winter. It’s taken a while for this collection to get oriented in the right direction, but now that Christian Lacroix is at the design helm, it’s finally showing signs of living up to its sportily glamorous heritage.</p><p>Lacroix exerted his talent for color and pattern in a collection that looked best at its least serious and most playful. He brought back Pucci archive prints in gray, red, white and black to apply to the obligatory city-friendly sweaters, minidresses and short trench coats, but the show picked up speed when he took to the idea of the slopes. Bubble-shaped nylon blousons in a riot of pinks and yellow, black knit salopettes with bands of color and zippy ribbed cardigans with quilted print fronts might not technically qualify as skiwear, but at this fashion altitude, it’s the fun that’s the point.</p><p>The further Lacroix pushed things, the better they got. Transferring Pucci psychedelia into patchwork furs and huge multipastel fox hats, he hit moments of nutty delight that had the audience smiling from end to end. For après-ski, Lacroix dutifully ran through a slew of dressy options in plissé fabrics. The standout was a delicious absinthe-green patterned velvet minidress with a fluff of fox at the collar, floating capelike over colored opaque tights. It was beautiful—but, as far as Lacroix has come with this collection, he still needs to learn how to edit.</p></div>"
36,fall,2003,f2003,emma-cook,"Emma Cook builds her collections around a time-traveling character named Susan, who, in her few seasons on the periphery of the London scene, has assumed the guise of everyone from Joan of Arc to Barbarella. It’s a cute way for her inventor to comment on current trends, and this time around ""Starboard Susan"" drifted naively to Earth as a sweet-toothed, girlie version of the space-age look. That meant jersey aviator helmets, cutout minidresses and jumpers with white tights, and clunky, low block-heeled patent pumps attached to ankle socks.</p><p>Some of Susan’s dresses and A-line skirts were pieced together with leather and suede into a pattern of the planets. Others were in a black and white shell-and-starfish print done on jersey, a couple of which were cut with wings of fabric attached to her wrists by plastic bracelets. At still other moments she appeared ready for countdown in bibbed overalls and hooded jumpsuits. The starship trooper’s more charming escapades came when she switched from monochrome into pink or yellow and decorated her shifts with real shells and a necklace of mother-of-pearl. All the same, though Susan was one of the first to go ’60s-futuristic last season, her wardrobe this time had a limp quality and never really took off.</p></div>"
37,fall,2003,f2003,emporio-armani,"<em>She’s got legs.</em> That’s not the message the fashion pack expects from Giorgio Armani, but from the minute his first model walked out in a black A-line mini coat—with high heels—it was clear his Emporio Armani girl was dashing off in a new direction. The ’60s are in the air, and Emporio has caught the kicky feeling. Armani’s version of short and cute steered clear of vintage rehash while leaving the line’s reputation for androgyny behind.</p><p>That was a refreshing departure, and it made Emporio Armani accessible to young women on the hunt for ideas to integrate into a fall look. The designer mixed textures, soft jackets and flippy skirts, chiefly in his signature palette of black, white and gray, with a few floral prints and a sprinkling of sparkle to pretty things up. There were variations galore, but mod striped mohair sweaters, double-layered skirts with a stylized poppy print, a firefighter’s leather-edged mac and a couple of zippy little leather jackets stood out. For evening, there was a lot of shadow play in opaque and sheer georgette and skimpy black satin dresses with diamanté clasps. The only girl to wear color was the last one out: Milla Jovovich, the face of Emporio’s advertising, wore a pink ruched frock with black shoulder straps—accessorized with a sunny smile.</p></div>"
38,fall,2003,f2003,fendi,"<em>Blade Runner</em> merged with the medieval. That’s where Karl Lagerfeld took Fendi for fall, and if it sounds a tad heavy, don’t be misled. That futuristic story line strung together some of the most high-spirited feats in fur and leather to be witnessed on planet fashion.</p><p>Lagerfeld began by cutting all his lengths short, concentrating on sculpted shapes to emphasize the body. His version of the season's ubiquitous down parka was a cross between a tiny formfitting ski jacket and a Renaissance doublet. With the addition of iridescent oil-slick leather, collars and cuffs done in sheared weasel, and zippers implanted in fuchsia satin, the generic turned super extraordinary.</p><p>Showstopping coats were fielded against a palette of petrol blue, purple, lavender and a slew of reflective metallics. Natalia Vodianova stepped out in ribbed silver leather that sprouted quivering tufts of white fox. Neat coats in gray Persian lamb came with laminated zones textured with embossing. Curly cascades of Mongolian lamb spilled out of a skeletal framework of cloth. One inside-out fur with a vast drooping collar was sewn from a single, enormous circular patchwork.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""0jvzg""></div></div><p>In all, the collection showed Lagerfeld's conviction that haute luxury needs to be pushed to the limit in order to stay compelling. That doesn’t necessarily mean over-the-top freakishness, either, which he proved with a lean, mean sable-lined chocolate crocodile coat, picked out in copper topstitching. It simply looked the epitome of sophisticated modernity.</p></div>"
39,fall,2003,f2003,gianfranco-ferre,"Imagine Madame Recamier on a Harley-Davidson and you're getting close to the starting point for Gianfranco Ferrés Fall collection. The designer noted in the program that he happens to share a birthday with Napoléon Bonaparte, a piece of synchronicity that put him on a historical-militaristic path that met up somehow with today's mood of aggression. The result, inspired partly by eighteenth-century French Revolutionary costumes, partly by motorcycle-gang-tough jeanswear and studded leathers, is a collision of fierce cutting and romantic flourishes.</p><p>The historical references included swaggering Napoleonic uniforms and the delicate empire dresses of the Empress Josephine and her court ladies. Floor-sweeping coats in black cashmere or brown leather came with straps and buckles in place of frogging. Breeches turned into zipped, cropped pants, and the puffed sleeve of the Directoire transformed into tightly seamed jackets lined in fur. All this was mixed in with stylized studded, zippered leather motorcycle pants and the kind of operatic collars that are the designer's signature.</p><p>Although Ferré operates on his own in terms of personal inspiration, the collection hit on the general trend for a raised-waist silhouette and an inflated shoulder line. It remains to be seen, however, just who will brave the sheer evening gowns with black lace panties fashioned into what looked like the pattern of an imperial shield.</p></div>"
40,fall,2003,f2003,gibo,"As a legion of thirtysomething designers assumes seniority, expressions of a new generation’s formative influences keep coming out of the woodwork. Gibo by Julie Verhoeven, an Italian line designed and presented in London, is one example of the struggle to transform the costume offenses of the 1980s into a new wave of style. Verhoeven, a noted illustrator who contributed to Marc Jacobs’s Fall 2002 collection for Louis Vuitton, is in the vanguard of girls whose first sensations of glamour were had to the strains of <em>Dallas,</em> while their mommies donned colored pumps and adjusted their shoulder pads for an evening out.</p><p>In this debut collection, Verhoeven showed wide-collar two-tone coats, shirred and draped purple slink dresses, lots of leaf-shape cuts, plenty of novelty buttons, quilted satin, sproutings of lace, and giant excrescences of junk jewelry. Was it ugly? Yes—but, arguably, not ugly enough. Things seemed to be complicated by the need to provide a semblance of commercial sanity in the collection—hence the skinny black pants that kept turning up and the drabness of the color palette. If Verhoeven had run amok with nasty ’80s color clashes and had had full-on ironic fun with the tacky exuberance of the time, she might have ended up with something so bad it was good. Instead it just came off as rather sad.</p></div>"
41,fall,2003,f2003,giorgio-armani,"For his main Fall collection, Giorgio Armani followed through on the short lengths and feminine sensibility he explored with his Emporio line. It was a much younger, softer feel that almost—but didn’t quite—cross over into the land of cute. In essence he recut his distinctively supple jackets to hug rib cage and bust and switched his focus from pants to flared skirts that stop five inches or so above the knee. It’s not a complete change of character, though: everything the designer showed for winter was in his beloved black and white.</p><p>Though short, Armani’s skirts—often done in stiff black ciré fabric—were a long way from the tarty pelmets that have been strutting other Milanese runways and a more feasible option for his core clientele of grown-up women (if you overlook the patterned sheer tights that opened the show, that is). His use of contrasting textures, meanwhile, turned up several variations on current trends. There were a few strapless black dresses and couture-like coats that put a modern spin on ’50s ladylike styling. And pieces like a black PVC jacket and a simple but decorative beaded tank are the kind of key items that can spark up a winter wardrobe. At a time when women love to cherry-pick across brands instead of acquiring single-label top-to-toe looks, those versatile possibilities alone represent a subtle breakthrough for the house of Armani.</p></div>"
42,fall,2003,f2003,givenchy,"In his third season as creative director at Givenchy, Julien Macdonald showed a collection that was sleek, dark and above all mysterious. Models wore their clothes like battle armor—slim leather and tweed coats over turtlenecks over knee-length skirts, accessorized with thigh-high boots and black leather gloves, often to the elbow. Most of the time the only skin exposed was on their faces. Not surprisingly, the fictional muse that inspired the designer this season is a woman with something to hide. ""She's a KGB spy living in Paris,"" he said backstage after the show. ""She's a woman you see only in passing and only at night.”</p><p>This collection was more restrained and classically sophisticated than we've come to expect from Macdonald; there were none of the gold lam¿ jumpsuits or shredded pastel denims he's been known to do in the past. He seemed to be looking back at Givenchy’s Audrey Hepburn heyday, showing chic, slimmed-down versions of the house’s classic belted trench coat in combinations of wool, leather and tweed. He even closed the show with a series of variations on the little black dress, trimmed with wide bands of crystals that, the designer said, were informed by the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels diamonds owned by the Duchess of Windsor. They twinkled like rainbows under the runway lights—proving that though he may have turned down the volume, Macdonald hasn’t entirely given up on glitz.</p></div>"
43,fall,2003,f2003,gucci,"This season every major designer is talking about creating a ""beauty"" strong enough to defy our anxious times. Backstage that was the word Tom Ford used to characterize his Fall collection for Gucci—a collection in which beauty was personified as a power vixen extravagantly armored to face down a troubled world.</p><p>She made her first entrance in a white coat with a huge collar, ballooning pushed-up sleeves and a full skirt, her midsection lashed into a buckled, corseted belt. With wicked black, spiky over-the-knee boots and long leather gloves, she struck the high-glam silhouette that dominated the show through a sequence of coats, jackets and slinky skirts seamed to cling to every dangerous curve.</p><p>The Gucci mini of last season was dropped—literally. Now the length is back down to the knee, with the emphasis on dramatic upstanding collars and voluminous sleeves, often exaggerated in fur and contrasted with the erotic suggestiveness of lingerie beneath. The skirts and dresses—paneled, ruched and pieced together with strips of ribbon—called up comparisons with corsetry. For evening, there were gowns constructed with cutout zones of sparkling mesh and frilled bra tops; others snaked to the floor, held in place with complex asymmetric straps crossing the torso and shoulders.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""erx45""></div></div><p>If Ford is treading the territory mapped out by Thierry Mugler and Azzedine Alaïa in the ’80s, it’s no surprise. Much of fashion is heading in that direction anyway, and Ford, after all, bases Gucci’s entire brand proposition on finding new ways of upping the ante on sex season after season.</p></div>"
44,fall,2003,f2003,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow is the last of the conceptualists to have come out of London—or maybe anywhere. Of the same generation (and Central Saint Martins schooling) as Hussein Chalayan, Morrow approaches design as an academic restructuring exercise, taking on the challenge of assimilating scientific and sport technologies into clothing. His defining twist—and what makes him interesting—is that he also has a taste for gorgeous old-world ornamentation.</p><p>Morrow said his thought process this season had been triggered by looking at the structure of parachutes used for dropping freight and by a pair of anti-G-force pants used in military aviation. No matter. What the audience grasped was what counts: his ability to make things like a great white satin-bound coat, skinny pants in rich gold silk jacquard, and narrow, inventively cut cashmere cord blazers. The two-inch-wide nylon tape used in parachute construction was incorporated in tailoring and interpreted as strips of ribbon running across a turtleneck. Layerings of mesh tanks and sweaters looked effortlessly cool over derivations of military pants.</p><p>Morrow has a strong sense of color, meaning he’s one of the few who can mix purple, sage green, peach, metallics and even the season’s potentially heinous royal blue with aplomb. When he circled round to end where he began, showing looped-up parachute tape bunched into dresses and tops, he landed firmly in the zone of avant-garde experiment. But, though it may pain him to hear it, it’s his more straightforward, wearable pieces that save him from the dead end of ’90s art-house clothing.</p></div>"
45,fall,2003,f2003,helmut-lang,"If bad times are a-coming, Helmut Lang is the man to outfit the brave. For fall he issued multifunctional layers for the urban warrior to strap on, carving everything to an athletic body line to help his army of followers stand tall in the face of geopolitical meltdown.</p><p>Soft armor for the corsetry militia. Leggings done in cross-laced layers. Form-hugging felted coats and knits, cut and sliced in flaps to secure with Velcro and magnets. Jersey holsters, girdle skirts, gartered stockings, harnesses and sexy zones of stretch. If it all sounds a tad busy and tarty, trust Lang to douse things with the impeccable colors of austere chic. Using black with navy or gray, a touch of dusty pink and then transparencies of ecru and white for night, he made clothes that stalk a fine line between his signature obsessions and a clean new silhouette.</p><p>Lang continued his splendid record of conviction for producing a covertly perverse luxury. The evidence included wedge-heeled boots, sometimes done in patent and trimmed with shearling; plissé chiffon chopped into minidresses; and leather stamped into a suggestion of high-tech military camouflage. His much-loved deluxe parkas and menswear coatings went missing from this Winter collection, but perhaps they’re being kept in the back now that so many have copied them. He certainly hasn’t abandoned his minimalism-with-a-gorgeous-kick: when he sent out Natalia Vodianova wearing a men’s shirt, skinny sweater and plain short skirt with a fringe of goat fur swinging from the front, his fans all but fainted.</p></div>"
46,fall,2003,f2003,imitation-of-christ,"The invitation gave it all away: red-and-white striped, in an envelope with confetti and a peanut, it was advance warning that IOC designer Tara Subkoff had run away to join the circus. And indeed her show, held in the cold, cold riding ring at Manhattan’s Pier 63, offered several variations on the theme of the spectacular. Trapeze artists, stilt walkers and trick ponies had nothing on a front row that included Harvey Keitel, Lorraine Bracco, Finola Hughes, Hope Atherton, Liz Goldwyn and China Chow, as well as the ever-multiplying, ever-sequined clan that is As Four.</p><p>The collection was presented in three sections. Camouflage menswear was followed by vintage-y, majorette-inspired gala dresses, which in turn gave way to a group of all-gray cotton clothes on a procession of models led by Chloë Sevigny, as Nick Cave's “This Is a Weeping Song” played on the soundtrack. The lyrics, the drab cadre of models and the military overtones hinted at social commentary, but the message, if there was one, was undercut by the finale: a fat lady singing—literally—to an operatic accompaniment over the sound system.</p><p>Once again, IOC has staged an elaborate, metaphorical critique of the fashion industry—with its focus on appearance, technical skill and some sleight of hand, it could be likened to a circus. But next time, it would be nice to really see some clothes. And some heating wouldn’t hurt, either.</p></div>"
47,fall,2003,f2003,james-coviello,"Although milliner-turned-designer James Coviello moved his show to the tents this season, he remained true to his romantic, vintage-y aesthetic. Inspired by a trip to Switzerland, the designer showed his ""1920s Alpine/Edwardian shooting party"" collection to a front row that included longtime friend Anna Sui as well as his affenpinscher, Francis.</p><p>True to form, Coviello built his presentation around knitwear, showcasing handcraft rather than trends and emphasizing the personal, small-scale nature of the label. Preppy, colorful sweaters, embellished with hearts and rhinestone-eyed reindeers, had a shrunk-in-the-washer fit and were paired with cargo pants in Pendleton wool plaids, printed velvets and denim, augmented with bondage-like straps. Femininity and sportiness played off each other in plaid suits with flouncy skirts, while floaty chiffon and lace dresses exuded old-time charm. A series of vests and jackets with folkloric embroidery displayed the handiwork for which Coviello is known, while the accessories—pointy lace-up and L.L. Bean boots—completed the casual, woodsy mood set by the antler chandeliers hung over the runway.</p></div>"
48,fall,2003,f2003,jasper-conran,"The relative rarity of a sophisticated collection dedicated to making grown women look polished makes Jasper Conran a standout here. In a country notorious for launching and then discarding young talents in short order, Conran is an exception who has managed to keep a business uninterruptedly since the mid ’80s.</p><p>This collection, based lightly on a cinematic chic of the ’60s, showed why. When Erin O’Connor walked out in a black shearling coat picked out with narrow bands of white leather, wearing slingbacks and swinging a matching patent purse on a chain, you could feel the collective shoulders of the audience drop with relief. It was a commitment to a certain snappy glamour, a nod to Audrey Hepburn—and even if we’ve seen it before, well, it’s a plot whose appeal never dims.</p><p>For day, the designer turned out smart little tweed coats with shearling collars, concise pea jackets and slim, well-cut black pants that were a current gloss on a classic. For evening, he had thought through all the variations on formalwear a modern woman might need and responded with pretty but practical scalloped-edge satin skirts and coats, and delicate powder-puff-pink dresses that burst into layers of ostrich at the skirt. To Conran’s credit, by the end of the show he’d shaken off any lingering shadow of retro.</p></div>"
49,fall,2003,f2003,jean-paul-gaultier,"Jean Paul Gaultier's shows are always a bit of a romp around a theme, as serious clothes hold together a string of Parisian one-liners. This season it was literally playtime on the runway—a glass structure supported by an army of dolls. To set the scene, Natalia Vodianova, fashion's favorite child-woman, toddled out wearing a smocked Norwegian sweater with a pair of infantile black frilly panties over woolly tights.</p><p>But be not afraid. Gaultier toyed with the baby-doll look, turning it into tiny puff-sleeved swing-back jackets and an aviator-style shearling, as well as romper suits (one, very scarily, in leather), but he didn't let the kid stuff distract from the great pieces that ground his work. A lot of those were furs, like the big knitted sweatshirt pulled over a cheerleader skirt and the striped jersey with a swathed neck and wide sleeves that followed from his couture collection.</p><p>He went a bit askew with some of the dippy Rick Owens-esque raw-edged leather and hefty handkerchief-point skirts, guaranteed to make any girl look a mile wide. But when he focused on reinventing the masculine/feminine tailoring and streetwear he's been playing with since the ’80s, the collection (in this revivalist moment) took off. His olive ski jacket, lashed tight with webbing straps and clips, is a fall classic. And that's no kidding.</p></div>"
50,fall,2003,f2003,jeremy-scott,"As a follow-up to last season's Devo-meets-Thierry Mugler collection, Jeremy Scott staged an elaborate fashion/cinema performance at the Tribeca Grand Hotel that could best be described as Steven Cojocaru-meets-Pierre Cardin.</p><p>The Beverly Hills–based designer's presentation was a spoof on a Hollywood awards show, as Scott (in a Gucci tuxedo and bandana) greeted each model in the style of a cheesy red-carpet commentator. Asked what she'd like to see more of in Hollywood, Anouck Lepère, in a silver coat with a radiating ring collar, responded “more Belgian movies,” while Croatian model Natasha Vojnovic advocated ""peace, no war!"" Lisa Marie and Liz Goldwyn were among the celebrities who walked the red carpet and also appeared in Scott’s movie, which premiered after the arrivals show and featured Asia Argento, China Chow, Monet Mazur and Tori Spelling. What did the models wear? Glamour dresses with stencils reading ""icon,"" ""bombshell"" and ""goddess"" and featuring the requisite sequins, marabou and lamé. New developments included denims with the designer’s face embroidered on the back pocket and Oscar statuettes on jacket sleeves, as well as custom lamé and leopard-print Adidas/Scott sneakers.</p><p>While designers like Imitation of Christ try to dissect fashion, Scott takes a literal, good-hearted and adoring approach. For him, it's all about “looking fabulous, darling.”</p></div>"
51,fall,2003,f2003,jil-sander,"Audience expectations of the Jil Sander collection have shifted. No longer one of the high-flown conceptual agenda setters of fashion, it now belongs to the category of Milanese shows that process a general mood into a line firmly intended to be commercial.</p><p>That means the success of the collection now depends on the market appropriateness of its chosen theme rather than groundbreaking inventiveness. For spring it was upscale athletic, this season posh punk. Milan Vukmirovic opened his show with a slick black patent motorcycle jacket, followed later by a beige patent trench. These, and a satin parka with straps and chrome D-rings, are the kind of items that can be cherry-picked out of the collection as reasonable, wearable classics that will be understandable when hanging in stores.</p><p>More questionable was Vukmirovic's follow-through with the idea of plaid. Kilts—never terribly flattering at the best of times—came redone in tiers of pleats made into asymmetric skirts or extended into dresses. The impression of watered-down punk iconography continued in the white shirt with an appliqu¿ of embroidered wings on the back, the leather bondage neck piece that tethered a halter-neck silk scarf dress, and T-shirts with “Wild heart” and “Sweet Angel” printed on them. Of course, Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo and Yohji Yamamoto have all had something gutsy to say on these subjects in the past, but Vukmirovic's interpretation went by without anything new to add.</p></div>"
52,fall,2003,f2003,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart makes clothes for uptown girls who go downtown to shop. For fall, the designer took a retro turn, delving into the lighthearted romanticism of Biba, the quintessential '60s London boutique. The show opened with a drop-waisted coat over a flared skirt, a silhouette borrowed from childrenswear, which set the tone for the baby-doll inspired looks that followed—including pinafore, tunic and Empire line dresses.</p><p>""I returned to my roots for this collection,"" Stuart said. ""I did the sweet, ladylike and pretty looks I love."" Among these were a very grown-up fur chubby (worn by Angie Schmit) and a number of short, snappy coats—rendered in everything from tweed to solid wool to dressy Jacquard—that could be worn to class by a coed or to dinner at eight.</p></div>"
53,fall,2003,f2003,john-galliano,"John Galliano put on the liveliest, most upbeat show of the season tonight at the Theatre de l'Empire on avenue Wagram. As a jazzed-up version of “Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy” blasted and neon showgirl lights flashed, the models tripped haughtily down the runway in twisted, bustled, blown-up ’40s suits, rainbow-bright crocodile platform shoes with diamond buckles, Joan Crawford–inspired evening dresses and giant glued-on triangular plastic eyebrows to match.</p><p>It was a collection that could only have come from the imagination of Galliano, a man who's channeled everything from Bollywood to kabuki and made all of it completely his own. This season he said he was going for a ""granny from hell"" look, focusing on real urban glamour and honest-to-goodness dressing up.</p><p>The show opened with a series of slim-skirted suits that were anything but classic. The palette of choice, inspired by the supersaturated tones of Crawford-era films, was totally Technicolor: apple green, peridot, cyclamen, lipstick red. Exaggerated hourglass shapes with huge bow bustles made waists look tiny, while shoulders were enormously puffed and asymmetrical, occasionally exploding into poufs of fruit-printed silk. All this was followed by pinup-girl lingerie—merry widows, garter belts, thigh-high silk stockings and sexy little tap pants—far too chic to be relegated to the bedroom.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""1nqbm""></div></div><p>For day, Galliano showed pom-pom-trimmed powder-pink sweaters that fell almost to the knee and printed silk dresses accessorized with giant rhinestone pins—one, in an overblown poppy print, looked particularly fresh. Evening looks, meanwhile, included highly Oscar-worthy gowns with all manner of ruffles and bustles and bows. (Nicole Kidman would be well advised to choose the dramatically draped peony silk.)</p><p>The Fall 2003 collection will be the first to fill what Galliano calls his ""dream boutique""—his first flagship store in Paris, where he plans to host dinner parties in the shop windows. His excitement at the prospect was evident in the clothes, and the energy was contagious. As the audience filed out of the theater, even the most jaded members of the fashion flock were smiling.</p></div>"
54,fall,2003,f2003,julien-macdonald,"Julien Macdonald’s London shows become more and more like two halves of a tabloid photo-opportunity party interrupted by a fashion parade. When Shirley Bassey took her seat for the 6 p.m. show, she probably didn’t think she’d have to wait nearly two hours to see what her fellow Welsh citizen has in mind for fall.</p><p>Before proceedings could begin, of course, the champagne-stoked audience watched Leah Wood deejay and attempted to attach names to the local soap-opera and TV celebs who packed the house. Pink and Christina Aguilera were the only two stars with any international standing, but to the British market insatiably eager for nonstop celebrity info, that scarcely mattered.</p><p>When the show finally started, the designer sent out what he believes in most fervently: tight, sexy, in-your-face clothes. He delivered jackets and combat pants that stuck to the body, often implanted with heavy-duty gold zippers. More to the point, he produced the kind of clothing that will allow the aforementioned tabloid fodder to appear in public as near to naked as possible.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dlgjjo""></div></div><p>Wisely, Macdonald brought his original distinguishing talent—knitwear—into play via some spider-webby catsuits and a tiny dress of crocheted stars calculated to show more of Liberty Ross than the world dreamed possible. If the scantily clad catch a chill, he has a solution: Saga Furs is a sponsor, and there were patchwork fur coats aplenty.</p><p>His Versace-esque evening gowns were a dismal pastiche of the maestro’s achievements. But when Macdonald knitted up his own ideas, the boy from Wales got a fleeting nod of approval from the fashion press—as they stampeded toward the after-party.</p></div>"
55,fall,2003,f2003,junya-watanabe,"Junya Watanabe’s beautiful Fall collection was every bit as romantic as the show’s venue, the Imperial ballroom at the InterContinental hotel, with its Grecian columns, painted cherubs and gilded <em>boiserie.</em> To the strains of cello concertos and lilting arias, models glided beneath the enormous chandeliers in awning-striped tea dresses, Peter Pan–collared jackets over flounced skirts and wasp-waisted tweed suits, trimmed with oversize bows. The silhouettes were right out of a Merchant Ivory period drama, but Watanabe would never be satisfied with interpreting any era so straightforwardly. The hems and sleeves were left raw and unraveling, and the rough, nubby tweeds and tartans were more Artful Dodger than <em>Room with a View</em>’s Lucy Honeychurch.</p><p>Sweet femininity and innocence were the order of the day, however, played up via giant hairpieces, teased to resemble frilly, wide-brimmed Edwardian hats or cascading as floor-length Rapunzel tresses that masked both the models’ faces and what they were wearing. Watanabe threw in several amusing riffs on classic Chanel: Madame’s pearl chokers sewn onto sweaters, chain belts threaded through full skirts (the effect was more punk than haute bourgeois) and the whole idea of the proper tweed suit as a kind of social armor.</p><p>Backstage after the show, Watanabe described the collection as “classic clothing interpreted in my own way.” And though it would be a stretch to call anything Watanabe does commercial, there were some very wearable pieces here. The slim dresses and flatteringly snug jackets, in particular, will surely be on many wish lists come September.</p></div>"
56,fall,2003,f2003,katayone-adeli,"Katayone Adeli’s brief, unadorned presentation bore witness to her conviction that a few well-expressed ideas make a stronger impact than a cacophony of half-baked gimmicks.</p><p>Retro currents run through every season, and this fall the attention seems to be on the late '50s and early '60s. Adeli demonstrated her respect for the past with slouchy sack jackets, tunic tops, blouson minis and perfectly fitted dresses that recalled masters of elegance like Cristobal Balenciaga and Hubert de Givenchy. She used appropriately ladylike fabrics—silk faille, satin, lightweight wool, brocade and chiffon—in a restricted palette made up mostly of black, navy and charcoal, but sparked with the occasional burst of color (a coral brocade coat, for example, or a green chiffon and gold lamé mini).</p><p>Demure though her inspirations might be, Adeli has a rock 'n' roll side, too. It came out in the ruffly, torn edges on chiffon tops and dresses, super-skinny pants under jackets, and a great new version of the old reliable black leather coat, made regal with an elaborately pinched and sewn collar.</p></div>"
57,fall,2003,f2003,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole has never been shy about expressing his point of view on current affairs. Political aphorisms, often in the form of puns, have been the mainstay of his advertising for more than a decade, and he used the moments before his fall show to present a short film that broadcast a few more (""Condoms should be used in all conceivable situations,"" etc.).</p><p>What those ideas have to do with Cole’s clothes is left to the viewer’s imagination, since the designer’s take on women’s fashion is decidedly unpolitical. The clean, simple collection was based around a few basic shapes clearly inspired by early-'60s mods. Minidresses and skirts were worn with flat silver boots; tight jeans and trousers were paired with short, fitted tops and sweaters, rendered in black, white, gray and silver with dashes of green, yellow or blue. Throughout, Cole used fabrics heavy on surface interest: felted wool, nubby knits, velvet and corduroy. The net effect was young and moderately sharp—just right for this designer’s style-savvy, but not edgy, consumer. Cole’s social conscience may be left of the mainstream, but his fashion is aimed squarely at center field.</p></div>"
58,fall,2003,f2003,krizia,"Krizia’s indomitable Mariuccia Mandelli has worked with a battalion of gifted designers, from Walter Albini in the ’70s to more recent conscripts Alber Elbaz and Jean-Paul Knott. This season Mandelli tapped the 34-year-old Hamish Morrow, whose own-name collection was a highlight of the London shows, to be her creative squadron leader. Morrow’s goal was to stay true to the spirit of a house celebrated for its sophisticated knitwear and adult approach to Milanese style, creating, as he put it, “expensive, luxe clothes that are effortless without being banal.”</p><p>Instead of the opulent fur and crocodile seen on some other Milan runways, Morrow opted for a sense of luxury through the “volume of the fabric.” His pelican-collared coats and waisted jackets, often worn with skinny-leg pants and boots, provided a more creative take on the ’80s/Alaïa trend that has surfaced so strongly this season. Brought in to collaborate on the collection just two months ago, the designer worked with existing fabrics, which juxtaposed double-face wools, metallic python and a thick, cracquelure leather with airy chiffons and crepe; the typical Krizia palette was in effect—carbon, tarnished silver and storm-cloud gray—with some injudicious viridian-green accents. But even if Morrow’s quirky, innovative use of color was missing, his hand could be sensed in the studious draperies and in details like the cashmere gauze pieces poetically overlaid with cloudy tiers of chiffon ribbon.</p></div>"
59,fall,2003,f2003,lagerfeld-gallery,"The Carousel du Louvre turned intergalactic for the Lagerfeld Gallery show, as red laser beams flashed and models emerged from clear beam-me-up-Scottie tubes to hit the runway.</p><p>The proceedings opened with a series of strict black suits—jackets and waistcoats worn with crisp white shirts, leather ties, and cropped skirts or cuffed trousers, all as skinny as the man who designed them. The collection ran red hot—thanks to fiery crimson miniskirts and fringed cherry-red fur scarves that dangled alluringly down the back almost to the knee—then turned icily chic, as twinkling platinum mesh tops and embroidered silver overcoats made an appearance to the sound of a disco-fied <em>Nutcracker Suite.</em></p><p>What held it all together were the impossibly high starched Edwardian collars—think Ryan Phillippe in <em>Gosford Park</em>—that the models wore with everything from suits to faded denim jeans from Lagerfeld’s two-seasons-old collaboration with Diesel. “It starts with the collars,” said the designer backstage when asked about his inspirations. “It’s not a historical reference or a menswear influence. It’s simply the idea of an impeccable white turtleneck that gives a clean, streamlined, graphic feeling to jeans, to T-shirts—to everything.”</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6ykdv""></div></div><p>During the final walk Lagerfeld took to the runway himself, in his own tight jeans, narrow black jacket and, of course, one of the mood-setting collars, his hair held in place by the same gleaming silver clip that had adorned the models’ ponytails. “Maybe it’s a little too much for me?” he asked well-wishers after the show. “Not to worry, Monsieur Lagerfeld,” an admirer assured him. “You wear it well.”</p></div>"
60,fall,2003,f2003,lanvin,"There aren’t many designers in the world who can handle the feminine and the refined without looking dated and chichi. But Alber Elbaz, at Lanvin, is one of the few capable of pushing delicate classicism toward an inspiring new edge. Declaring that he “wanted to do something beautiful that reflects what’s going on around us,” he took extravagant materials—satin ribbon, Chantilly lace, couture-grade silk, python and fur—and worked them alongside the more modern, disciplined look of exposed zippers and ribbed jersey.</p><p>Elbaz’s defining looks included neat black waisted knee-length dresses made of vertical lengths of ribbon invisibly set on strips of tulle; as the models walked, the narrowness of the silhouette broke into a gorgeous fan. The ribbon motif ran throughout the collection, sometimes flattened into an asymmetric bow on the front of a jacket or the derri¿re of a skirt. Exquisite knife-edge pleating turned up in a lipstick-red dress, a strict belted coat swinging into a plissé skirt, and as glamorous detail in the back vent of an ultrachic black taffeta trench with ribbon-tied cuffs.</p><p>The ladylike-meets-military feel was at its most focused when the decorative haberdashery got worked into ribbed knit zippered suits. A fur sweater with a zipper in the shoulder marched over tight pants tucked into black boots. After that came a slew of little cocktail dresses, some made entirely in black lace, others as sheaths of geometric bugle beading or distressed silver sequin. Crafted with extraordinary skill, the collection was another step in the reevaluation of charm and luxury that is shaping up as fashion’s newest movement.</p></div>"
61,fall,2003,f2003,louis-vuitton,"A new big-shouldered, graphic silhouette is working its way into the fashion system, and Marc Jacobs is bent on making it look like something we’ve never seen before. For starters, his short, slightly stiff navy coat had a large wide-set collar embellished with darkly sparkling disks and swung over a felt skirt, long socks and high square-toe crocodile pumps. The volume of that rounded shoulder, cut on the curve, stood out—literally—through the entire Louis Vuitton collection. It surfaced in sleeveless coats worn over big-sleeved sweaters and in the new shape of his beloved pea jacket; it was exaggerated even more in the furry mass of a caped Mongolian coat and in the funnel-shaped stole that was part of a suit.</p><p>By cropping skirts and dresses short, often with an under layer or a squared-off panel hitting a different level in back, Jacobs filtered ’60s and ’80s influences to come up with something fresh. There was a touch of the current feel for space-age-slash-medieval militarism in the studded tunics and coats cut to hint at armor-plated layers. Formfitting ribbed knit dresses with a hint of Claude Montana about them ended in a flip of gladiator pleats. But a couple of simply pretty tiered chiffon dresses, tied with velvet bows—and all those cute socks—kept the show from stumbling under the weight of its references.</p><p>One of the ways Jacobs keeps his luxury lighthearted is an irreverent patching together of precious traditional fabrics with something flashily modern. For fall, he rendered the classic brown-and-yellow monogram in printed vinyl and paired it with tweed in a raincoat and a trashy-meets-ladylike handbag—his iconic Louis Vuitton-craze device for the season.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""pkqm7""></div></div><p>If the designer had kept his audience guessing at the influences behind the show, all became clear when the fans surged back to congratulate him. As Catherine Denueve emerged from the throng, Jacobs grabbed her hand and exclaimed, “It was you! That David Bailey picture of you in the socks and short skirt. Remember? That and Joan of Arc—my heroines!”</p></div>"
62,fall,2003,f2003,luella,"Luella Bartley is not one to dawdle. She gets a feeling for a season, she puts it on the runway, and then… bang, she's onto the next thing. Case in point: While her spring collection was packed with bubbly, body-conscious fashions inspired by athletics, fall's line is aimed at serious urban hipsters who have the lyrics to ""Clash City Rockers"" committed to memory.</p><p>In a season where clothes are getting shorter and tighter, Bartley pulled a 180, showing supersize boyfriend jackets over ripped-up Levis, generous overcoats and full-cut pinstripe trousers with platform winkle pickers. (There were, admittedly, some slimmer looks, like fitted sweaters and knit dresses ornamented with big toothy zippers, and slim knit pants tucked into socks.) Lest anyone forget that she has a taste for fine things, Bartley added some luxury pieces, like an army duffle coat augmented with fur and worn over a black and gold bias-cut dress. For those seeking traditional sex appeal, meanwhile, there were satin minis and a black pencil skirt cut tight enough to be a girdle. Bartley even has a new handbag line, making it possible for loyal customers to carry a piece of the designer's inimitable aesthetic at all times.</p></div>"
63,fall,2003,f2003,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Under Marc Jacobs’ direction, even the remnants of awkward adolescence can yield fashion gold. With his secondary line, the designer plays up some of his favorite inspirations—’70s teen culture and the haphazard chic of thrift-store style—to create the young, zippy looks that keep his hip customers coming back for more.</p><p>While spring’s collection was like a rummage through an artsy girl’s closet, fall was more a stroll through the hallway of a rather tough high school. Taking workaday looks such as lumberjack plaid and faded denim, Jacobs cropped and nipped them to create neat little jackets and pants. He showed lots of jeans, cut skinny and cropped mid-calf or with a bit of ribbon running down the side seam, as well as A-line minis and dresses similar in spirit to the mod-inspired collection he had presented the previous night. Knits showed up as basics (ribbed turtlenecks were everywhere) or in girlish cardigans and pullovers with trompe l’oeil sweetheart necklines. Jacobs cemented the ’70s feeling by mixing slightly clashing shades of rust, lavender, orange, yellow, black, red and blue.</p><p>The Marc look, at least as it appears on his runway, is studiously slapdash, with the designer and his crew creating outfits via faux-casual layerings. A jacket over a cardigan over a T-shirt over jeans over leggings, with a belt, should be a cacophony. The fact that it isn’t is a large part of the line’s charm.</p></div>"
64,fall,2003,f2003,marc-jacobs,"The Marc Jacobs collection is a high point of the show calendar, and not just because the designer's front row is always packed with celebrities (this time: P. Diddy, Liv Tyler, Kristin Davis, Claire Danes, and regulars like Michelle Hicks, Anna Sui, and Helena Christensen). Jacobs has firmly established himself as fashion's bellwether, with an audience that looks to him to pluck out the prevailing trends and decree them relevant.</p><p>This season, Jacobs is clearly feeling very mod. His show, set to churning punk rock (X-Ray Spex's ""Oh Bondage"" kicked off the soundtrack), was a color-splashed paean to pop, with overt references to the sixties space-age designs of Courrèges, Paco Rabanne, and Rudi Gernreich. Minidresses and jumpers in various patchwork combinations of orange, blue, beige, white, pink, violet, and red came dashing down the runway, detailed with felted seams and circle pockets and worn with contrasting hose and sweet little pumps. His silver fur-trimmed parka and boxy wool jackets are destined to displace the peacoat as next season's must-have outerwear.</p><p>Even the evening looks kept the beat. Jacobs showed black and white satin minis with piped seams, as well as a few literally swinging dresses featuring ropes of giant sequins or slashed fabric sewn into a drooping bell. It was cheerful and chock-full of energy and color; but all the literal references to past fashions verged on re-creation, rather than the renewal for which Jacobs is justly famous.</p></div>"
65,fall,2003,f2003,marni,"Where have all the flowers gone? The fall breeze has blown the faded roses clean out of the Marni garden, leaving something sharper, shorter and chicer in their place. Consuelo Castiglioni shifted her scene this season, away from country-house antiquey fabrics toward an artsy reinterpretation of late-’60s retro.</p><p>Her eclectic bohemians have forsaken their wispy layers for high brown leather boots, smart knee-length shorts and minidresses in Sonia Delaunay–esque prints. Everything Marni looks more finished—literally. Instead of raw edges, the curving inside-out seams on dresses and tweed patchwork mélanges were outlined in satin binding. The late-’60s feel came from the off-key spectrum of pinks, browns, royal blue, chrome yellow and strange greens (a color chart that is becoming standard for fall) and cute little items like bibbed pinafores.</p><p>Most strikingly, the covert luxe that has always been an undercurrent of the Marni trademark turned overt. Fox shrugs and lightweight chubbies and the cool, slightly distressed green leather jackets and coats had a glamour that put the collection in step with seasonal trend. Marni devotees—a style tribe used to wending their own alternative ways—are about to wake up and find they're in fashion. But will they miss their flowers?</p></div>"
66,fall,2003,f2003,martin-grant,"Australian-born Martin Grant, whose shop in the Marais district has long been a haunt for fashion insiders like Naomi Campbell, put on a charming, well-edited show with the youthful but wistful elegance we’ve seen this season in collections like Rochas by Olivier Theyskens and Proenza Schouler. With smart little dresses, slim coats and detail-rich skirts, Grant, like those other young designers, makes grateful, and graceful, reference to the past. But he's not anchored to it: bell sleeves on jersey tops whispered classic Saint Laurent, while a three-quarter-length suede coat was subtly ’70s.</p><p>Despite the historical allusions, Grant showed a modern collection for modern girls. The updated Twiggy silhouette that feels so right this season was there, done in bronze and gold cotton and Lurex. There were cape-backed tops—another key look of the moment—and grosgrain ribbon trims that kept things very <em>jeune fille.</em> A beautifully embroidered tulle skirt managed to make ethnic details look refined.</p><p>These are truly ladylike clothes, polished and sexy but with refreshing hints of irony. Motorcycle-leather topstitching saved gold satin tops from appearing too precious, while crinoline skirts, hugely full and poufed in the back, created an edgy profile. It was all <em>trés chic, tr#233;s parisienne,</em> and it left some in the audience comparing Grant to Charles James—no small compliment.</p></div>"
67,fall,2003,f2003,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon’s collection latched onto some of the avant-garde trends that are currently orbiting planet fashion. Plaid, Lurex, zippers, off-kilter color combinations and collaged piecings of oddly matched fabric were worked into a show whose loose theme was punk-meets-sci-fi.</p><p>Sitbon started with black plaid sparkle-shot coats, cut away over short, dippy asymmetrical skirts made of bits of layered tulle and other fabrics. Then she did complex things with striped knits in gray, black, white, yellow and red, overlaying them with curvy corded bands, in patterns that mimicked the shape of ethnic vests. There were gray satin bombers, utility-pocketed skirts and anoraks decorated with red sequin strips made to suggest harnesses.</p><p>The designer followed up with a lot of garments that looked as if they’d been chopped up and adapted from other pieces of clothing, then ended with jackets that featured zippered-in sleeves and some distressed silver space-man leather. The trouble was that Sitbon’s ideas came across as derivative and somewhat dreary, while the intelligent feminine design that usually characterizes her shows was nowhere to be seen.</p></div>"
68,fall,2003,f2003,matthew-williamson,"Well, Britney may have been a no-show this year, but Michael Jackson made an appearance, via a mix in the soundtrack that accompanied Matthew Williamson's fall show, “Bubblegum Superstar” —“‘Bubblegum,’” said Williamson, “because there was a lot of pink, and ‘superstar’ because the clothes were sexy and showy, not clothes that you can hide behind.”</p><p>Williamson himself has never been one to hide from color, and this season was no exception. Flared corduroy pants and very mini skirts were worn with fluorescent stilettos by Christian Louboutin and neon belts fastened, for a change, at the nape of the back. Prints were much in evidence, from the vintage Missoni-like patterns that opened the show to the series of richly hued, Eastern-inspired bird prints that closed it. There was no shortage of decorative elements, either, from sweaters with passementerie embellishments to a series of very covetable fur-trimmed jackets. And if Williamson flirted with an electroclash vibe—via jackets decorated with shiny metallic studs, stars and grommets—the quality of his craftsmanship helped him avoid a reductive retro groove.</p></div>"
69,fall,2003,f2003,max-mara,"If you’re going to invest in a major coat, why should it be boring? That was the question that MaxMara, the Italian powerhouse that founded its fortune on making outerwear for generations of women, answered for fall. The collection offered lots of tempting topcoat propositions, featuring modern cuts that looked current without trying too hard to be trendy.</p><p>MaxMara’s strategies for a new but wearable fall look were in step with ideas instigated in New York at Narciso Rodriguez and Proenza Schouler: either base everything on skinny leggings worn mid-heel with slingbacks, or pull on the season’s crucial over-the-knee boots. Shapes that go over that slim line can then assume new volumes and textures without overwhelming the body.</p><p>The newest concept on display was a caped jacket or coat, sometimes done in leather, chicly fused with a speckled tweed lining. In a canny nod toward menswear-for-women (another key notion emerging for fall), the classic double-breasted coat was eased up and oversized, while more sporty looks came courtesy of cashmere bombers with ribbed welts, leather gilets and big, orange down-filled parkas. Low-slung, egg-shaped hipster skirts and a hugely oversize gray knit sweater worn as a dress, meanwhile, offered around-town options that—just for a change—made absolutely no reference to the ’60s. And for that, working women of the world give thanks.</p></div>"
70,fall,2003,f2003,michael-kors-collection,"Michael Kors is at his best when he allows a little edge to cut through his luxurious sensibility. The collection he showed for fall, rife with references to biker leathers and tough-but-sexy chicks, had just the right blend of rock ’n’ roll energy and urban sophistication.</p><p>In his notes, Kors mentioned the go-go world of Warhol in the ’60s, but the collection was refreshingly free of retro references—unless you count the legions of tight little minis he sent out, in cashmere, crocodile and stretchy wools. (The best of all, a marvelous piece of walnut-brown fringed suede, was worn—like no one else can—by Naomi Campbell.) Kors paired these, or smart, skinny pants, with great oversized toppers of all genres: giant satin jean jackets, studded black leather styles, slouchy anoraks with fur trim and generous reefers and bathrobe coats made from plush cashmere or mink. For night, he stitched bands of silvery fringe onto skirts and dresses, and ended with a dazzling, glittery disco-ball of a dress on Carmen—perfect for frugging the night away at Ondine's</p></div>"
71,fall,2003,f2003,missoni,"Even before the show started, there was a lot of cross-generational action on the Missoni runway. Seventies supermodel Pat Cleveland and her 13-year-old daughter Anna Van Ravenstein—both dressed top to toe in wiggly Missoni knits—cavorted for photographers with Margherita, daughter of designer Angela Missoni. It all signaled the recharged energy of this family-owned house, which is getting ready for a 50th-anniversary celebration.</p><p>The ’60s are in the air, and there's no harm at all in revisiting them—especially when you’re a house that has some direct experience with the decade. It's perfect timing: Angela Missoni, who is preparing a fashion show of her parents' designs for September, said, ""I was looking through all the things in our archive, so I was thinking that way anyway."" For fall she took swirly browns, blues, yellows, emeralds and turquoises and styled them into Cardin-esque minidresses and the patterned knit coats that are giving Missoni a rejuvenated relevance.</p><p>Angela Missoni is smart enough to contemporize the label's appeal beyond the signature jazzy pattern. She showed how the knits and print satin blouses can be worn maybe with a great boot-leg pant in bright yellow or look fab with a pink fur thrown on top. She also sent out a hit from the archives: a minidress knitted in overlapping petals of colored Lurex, first done in 1966. Not great for the grannies and mommies, perhaps, but just perfect for those leggy teens currently making the Missoni scene.</p></div>"
72,fall,2003,f2003,miu-miu,"If Miu Miu is Prada's kid sister, she's squaring up for a bout of sibling rivalry for fall. She's all grown up, and she wants the tweeds and the furs and the raincoats—and the posh croc bag with the head scarf tied to it. If big sis is getting into menswear, she'll have a piece of that, too, and some of those silk dresses and gloves for good measure.</p><p>The Miu Miu act isn't a literal duplication of the main line, of course, but it catches the same spirit of classic dressing, inheriting quite a few of Prada's greatest hits, as well as some cuter fillips. The fur tippets from Prada's famous ’40s collection reappeared here, twisted into scarves and capes. The house styling trick of cinching a waist with an unmatched leather belt turned up on coats, cardigans and dresses. Last winter's great rubberized mac and tweedy pencil skirts made an encore too.</p><p>This collection is all about filling shops with inexpensive, fast-moving items, and even if a lot of the ideas are Prada recycling her own vintage design, it's still apace with her current thinking. It doesn't give the thought-through luxe of its elder, but it does have witty ways of imitating. Instead of a full fur lining inside a sweater or jacket, an extended furry collar is tucked inside things to fake the effect. There's the key gauntlet glove, but in gray mohair knit, not croc. Good buys abound: well-cut mannish suits, wing-tip shoes and eye-catching pink or red houndstooth coats. As Miuccia Prada has always asserted, Miu Miu isn't a watered-down diffusion line. These sisters know when to share and when not to—so everyone goes home happy.</p></div>"
73,fall,2003,f2003,moschino,"To the strains of Madonna’s “Holiday” and “Like a Virgin,” a parade of Park Avenue punk princesses strolled down the Moschino runway, which was lit by a disco ball and a border of lightbulbs suggesting a diva’s dressing-room mirror.</p><p>The raunchy Moschino gals, as imagined by creative director Rossella Jardini and designer Vincent Darré, looked like early-’80s wannabe-starlets—the kind once featured in Andy Warhol’s <em>Interview,</em> the kind who ransacked their mothers’ closets in search of vintage glamour. Luxe mink-trimmed and jet-beaded satin evening jackets and coats were accessorized with jewels that might have been scooped up at random from momma’s dressing table. These bourgeois props were mixed with short ’50s prom petticoats in nylon tulle (blowing their coat skirts to pneumatic proportions) and satin ski pants. Patent Courrèges-style go-go boots and Rubik’s Cube eyewear rounded out a look that was just right for storming Studio 54 or braving the Mudd Club.</p><p>The ’80s-’60s clash is a strong trend this season, and the Moschino design team married it well to the house's spirit of jokey classics. Paco Rabanne–inspired dresses were made from large discs seemingly cut out of “Moschino” beer cans, while mohair tunic sweaters were belted in patent leather. (Lightbulb earrings, on the other hand, did not come across as the brightest idea on the block.) Born actresses Natasha Vojnovic and Rie Rasmussen led the Material Girls for the finale, vamping it up à la Janice Dickinson and Pat Cleveland.</p></div>"
74,fall,2003,f2003,narciso-rodriguez,"More streamlined than a Jaguar and perhaps even better at handling curves—that was Narciso Rodriguez’s gorgeous fall show, where the designer showed once again that cool and sexy can coexist in one collection.</p><p>Rodriguez continued with the long, lean silhouette he showed in the spring, using rigorously precise cutting and tailoring to sculpt form-fitting dresses and suits. There were great examples of his whip-thin, athletic dresses, done in black or white with geometric accents detailing the hips and shoulders, as well as beautiful suits with skirts or slim pants that came just to the ankle. And while the lines were spare, there was luxury built into each piece, such as when the designer combined two or three fabrics in one outfit—velvet, silk and marocain, for example—for a play of textures.</p><p>In a week where a lot of time has been spent looking back at the past, it was refreshing to see a show that had virtually no retro references; although clearly schooled in minimalism, Rodriguez has a fashion vocabulary all his own. He has also loosened up, just a bit. The silhouette had a bit more swing, in the form of a flaring black velour coat and some mesmerizingly floaty hems on a few dresses and skirts. His evening pieces were dazzlingly simple: cool columns of chiffon, matte silk and marocain, done in white or, for the last number, the coolest lavender silk, which breezed off the runway like a beautiful memory.</p></div>"
75,fall,2003,f2003,nicole-farhi,"Long-established French designer Nicole Farhi lives in London and has a network of boutiques founded in partnership with her ex-husband, Stephen Marks, the owner of FCUK and a senior figure in the British fashion industry. Together they have a reputation as purveyors of the acceptable face of British style—clothes capable of traveling the Atlantic with an even chance of being understood by the American public.</p><p>Farhi thinks of wardrobe options rather than sweeping collection statements or runway theatrics, and many British women rely on the attainable, everyday luxury of her sportswear. One of the label’s strengths is outerwear, which carried through for fall in a variety of neat-to-the-body coats and jackets, often trimmed with deep fur collars. Reversed rabbit-skin coats and distressed-leather jackets with puffy poacher pockets exude just the right note of casual confidence for busy female executives.</p><p>Farhi’s up-to-the-minute formulas—cropped pants and leather boots; a flippy pleated chiffon skirt worn with opaque tights—are timeless fall options for women who simply want to look right without trying too hard. Life is complicated enough as it is.</p></div>"
76,fall,2003,f2003,nicole-miller,"While it sometimes may seem the world is awash in clothes, finding examples with the right mix of sophistication and practicality can be remarkably difficult. That’s where Nicole Miller has made her reputation, and her fall collection shows her continued ability to meet that challenge.</p><p>The first part of her presentation included body-conscious jersey and satin dresses, tops and miniskirts in muted green, mocha, plum and black, and shaped by shirred panels. All these looks, including a pretty green shearling coat embroidered with a deco peacock-feather motif, were flattering and easy on the eyes, if not terribly new.</p><p>Miller made a more individual statement with a series of party dresses. The designer demonstrated her eye for balancing glitz with wearability, putting just a few deco touches on her ’20s-esque flapper shifts and dropping down the neckline of a red gown—but not too, too far. And her sparkly bouclé coat was a prime example of Miller at her best: smart enough for day, cool enough for night.</p></div>"
77,fall,2003,f2003,oscar-de-la-renta,"All the current talk of a return to ladylike fashion must strike Oscar de la Renta as pretty amusing. While other designers pick up and drop influences each season, de la Renta has been buffing and polishing his part-fantasy, part-practical sportswear approach for decades. Elegance is his native tongue.</p><p>For fall, de la Renta's daywear took a distinctly cozy turn. He started off with plush, plum-colored cashmere knits paired with cool brown suede or cashmere flannel and sometimes trimmed with sable. He took brocade, one of the most tradition-bound fabrics in the lexicon, and cut it into jazzy, fitted little cocktail dresses. He also sent out some austerely beautiful evening dresses, several seductive variations on his signature ruffled party confections, and suits that will last through the decade, never mind the season.</p><p>Where the designer was clearly having fun, though, was in shuffling together day and evening looks: de la Renta paired a taupe cashmere tank with an airy black taffeta skirt, put a chubby fox fur vest over gold silk brocade crop pants, and tossed one of his princely embellished coats atop slim trousers and a simple silk blouse. Both comfortable to wear and delightful to look at, this is the kind of elegance that only comes with experience.</p></div>"
78,fall,2003,f2003,paul-smith,"Sir Paul Smith hasn’t put on airs and graces since receiving his knighthood, though he’s London’s most financially successful designer. When he turns his attention to women’s wear, however, his clothes always look like the work of a cheeky lad out to charm the cleverest girl at art school into bed.</p><p>For fall, he gathered ideas during a whistle-stop world tour that started in Moscow and ended in New York, where he saw an exhibit of Russian Constructivist book design. The latter inspired the thread-trailing disk-and-stripe appliqu¿s on the frayed tweeds that opened the show, and throughout the collection he used geometric or leaf prints—although in a post-revolutionary palette of yellow, green, pink and black—to unify his theme. This was no propaganda overhaul, though. Smith can’t resist tinkering with his old favorites: school uniforms, delinquent debutantes’ partywear and the lexicon of gentleman’s attire on which he founded his name.</p><p>Those appeared this season as dippy asymmetric raw-edged kilts, striped school blazers and scarves, vaguely ’30s satin print dresses and embroidered kimonos suitable for a sexy intellectual. Occasionally the collection took a turn into corporate branding, as when his signature swirly print appeared in chiffon and chain-mail dresses or branched off disconcertingly into embroidered black leather. The most amusing moment came when Sir Paul sent out his men’s shirts, buttoned all askew and back to front, with sleeves knotted to mimic bustles or thrown over the shoulder like a one-strap dress. It was a vision of morning-after wear in the bedroom of the (evidently successful) boyfriend.</p></div>"
79,fall,2003,f2003,peter-som,"Trends may come and trends may go, but there is always room for well-made sportswear classics. Which is where Peter Som comes in; only a few seasons into his career, the 32-year-old designer has developed a following for clothes that are lighthearted but still luxurious.</p><p>Som has an eye for fabrics that can stand on their own, from light, spongy bouclé tweeds to a crinkly gold-foil-embossed knit to a liquid mercury satin. The colors, like charcoal gray, toffee brown, ivory and pink, were subtle and appealing, and the shapes were mostly simple and straightforward: A-line skirts, shirtdresses, trousers cut trim but not tight, jackets that hit flatteringly at the hip. The designer added interest by tweaking one or two elements in each outfit—shaping a floating chiffon skirt with rows of bias pin tucks, or finishing off a soft gray mohair suit with bishop sleeves. Som scattered fox fur through the collection, adding long cuffs to a slim gray sweater and topping off a few outfits with giant wraps. He got ahead of himself a few times, as with a two-piece charmeuse outfit that had more twisting and tucking than a gymnastic event. And culottes are rarely, if ever, flattering. But overall, Som’s easy cool is making a justified name for itself.</p></div>"
80,fall,2003,f2003,pierrot,"By dedicating himself exclusively to knitwear, the French-born, New York–based designer Pierrot starts out with some pretty serious limits to his medium. After all, how many ways are there to work a knitting needle or a crochet hook? Fortunately for his audience, Pierrot is a showman as well as a craftsman, and he makes every stitch tell a story.</p><p>This season, he sent out a collection that referenced (in roughly chronological order) German Expressionism, Russian Constructivism, Mondrian, Pop and Op art, and Japanese pop culture. There were cardigans in soft colors paired with crocheted skirts; witty, bold wrap dresses and red sweaters with “Pierrot” spelled out in faux-cyrillic script; off-the-shoulder tops decorated with Warholian bananas; and pretty, poppy-scattered twinsets in vivid blue, all shown on models who gleefully vamped and jived for the audience. (Designer Benjamin Cho and transgender personality Amanda Lepore made guest appearances.)</p><p>In addition to the artsy showcase pieces, the designer turned out simple, pretty cable sweaters and skirts, turtlenecks, and sweater coats. In fact, with the addition of menswear to his label, Pierrot will now be hard-pressed to find a customer he can’t put in a knit.</p></div>"
81,fall,2003,f2003,prada,"When the going gets tough, no one can cut an argument for great design with as much substance, conviction and richness of intelligence as Miuccia Prada. Using an unlikely mix of potentially dowdy British tweeds and men’s shirting, bright, lustrous William Morris prints, humble lining silks and deluxe furs and skins, she performed sheer alchemy to create a vision of high chic for hard times.</p><p>Prada started by introducing a new cut—a funnel-neck coat with a yoke shoulder and raised, belted waist. Then she eked sexiness out of striped men’s shirts, pinstripe pants and pencil skirts in windowpane suiting fabric by showing them with satin platform slingbacks and a soupçon of the undone. A shirt came with a chopped-off raw sleeve. A black alligator coat was worn over just a shirt and a long, mannish sweater, looking as though the wearer had somehow forgotten her skirt—but fabulous just the same. Accessorized though they were to the last detail, with gloves and the season’s boxy bags hanging from leather and metal chains, the outfits all had an air of elegant off-hand improvisation.</p><p>Part of this collection’s genius is that it has continuity <em>and</em> ingenuity: all the hallmarks of Miuccia Prada's talent are on show. Take the way she has of ordaining the peculiar as newly desirable. This season it’s Willam Morris–by–way–of–Liberty flower prints, used as formfitting knee-length dresses, shirts and a deerstalker hat. Or her way of letting the uptight formality out of eveningwear with form-skimming dresses in unpressed lining silks or crinkled georgette, shown with fabric neck pieces (a continuation of Spring’s beaded jewelry). Visually and intellectually, this is a collection that hit the high notes. Post-show, Prada explained her endeavor to be “a desperate search for beauty as we wait for war.” Bad times or no, it's fashion guaranteed to make women desperate to shop.</p></div>"
82,fall,2003,f2003,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Respect for Preen, which has made its mark on the map of London street chic, is on the rise. This collection, called Protection, had a tough attitude—almost Belgian in its intensity—but managed to march to its own beat. The basic idea was layering, all in a spectrum of urban gray and industrial metallics. The silhouette—if that’s not too pretentious a term for this form of gutter elegance—was put together from tight, belted tweed jackets worn as short coats, thick rib-knit, Lurex-flecked tunics, and double or triple layerings of blousons or billowing raincoats over frilled skirts. The unifying device of leather boots or leggings gave the look a skinny swagger, meaning that the attenuated body line never got lost among the tiers.</p><p>Bringing a low-key design interest to the staples of everyday dressing, Preen recast urban utilitywear as marly sweats, leg-hugging suede cargo pants and ribbed tanks, cut away and worn in multiples. So Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi can rethink cut and beat-up fabric with the best of them, but what sets them apart from the pack is knowing when to stop short of turning clothes into intellectual statements. This couple entered fashion not by staging showy runway coups but—with refreshing unconventionality—by building a business steadily from the small shop they opened in Portobello Green in 1996. That all means that Preen knows how to design stuff they’ll actually sell. With seven years under their belt, they’re almost setting a record for longevity in business among young London designers.</p></div>"
83,fall,2003,f2003,proenza-schouler,"Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez presented their first major collection at the National Arts Club this season, courtesy, in part, of the Ecco Domani Foundation and <em>Vogue</em>. Both Parsons graduates, the duo came up by way of jobs at Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, respectively, and named their label after their mothers. The clothes they showed, though, were as far from matronly as possible—chic, sophisticated and new.</p><p>Models with “just back from a party” silver-dipped lids paraded through the club in slouchy jackets, legging-slim pants and beautifully cut bustier tops with racing backs. The tightly focused collection was rendered in a muted palette of mostly black and charcoal, and it conjured a distinctly cinematic feel: a heroine slinking through a smoky Paris (or New York) evening, her legs lengthened by black patent stilettos extending out from under a cocoony jacket that falls suggestively off her shoulder.</p><p>What marked the collection as American was the duo’s focus on transforming basic wardrobe staples into desirable luxury items. “Long johns” were worked in black silk, and leather coats were painted white and trimmed at the collar with raccoon. Even the humble hoodie got a new life when paired with a pencil skirt and black cashmere bolero on Ann Catherine and worn, by Danielle Zinaich, under a sleeveless coat with Fred Leighton diamonds. More accessible sparkle was offered by way of Proenza Schouler’s sequin, satin and metallic gauze bustiers, which drew appreciative looks from an audience that included Isaac Mizrahi, Debbie Harry and a heavy-duty array of top editors and retailers.</p></div>"
84,fall,2003,f2003,ralph-lauren,"Maybe it was just coincidence that Ralph Lauren chose to show his Fall collection in Manhattan’s Chelsea area, in a light-filled art gallery with rustic bleachers and exposed beams. Ever the Anglophile, Lauren’s collection was full of references to the other Chelsea, in London, where the rich and bohemian have thrived for decades.</p><p>With early Bob Dylan and Rolling Stones setting a retro-counterculture mood, Lauren sent out elegantly tailored pieces that underscored his ability to transpose menswear into a feminine key. He cut trim little jackets and slim pants from mossy tweeds, and made nut-brown suede into cool motorcycle jackets worn over fluttering satin skirts. A nod to dandyism showed through in a green plaid overcoat worn with a velvet shirt and tie, and plummy velvet suits—perfect for the modern-day bluestocking. For evening, Lauren went full-on feminine, via a series of icy-cool pieces touched with silvery beading. His white charmeuse top over black velvet leggings is just the thing for a chic dinner party, while a night out on the town (or on the red carpet) demands one of his snowy white satin columns—topped with a suitably funky black motocross jacket.</p></div>"
85,fall,2003,f2003,rick-owens,"""Who doesn't want to come to Paris if they're a designer?"" said Rick Owens. ""It's the ultimate place."" Right. Putting on a show in the City of Light exposes a designer to an international audience—and the competition's fiercest glare. Even though Owens has been building a following out of L.A. for years, this collection represented the official breakthrough onto the world stage for his strong but subtle goth aesthetic.</p><p>Owens's supple, beat-up skins and fine layers of crinkled cr¿pe and knit have become cult items over the past couple of years, partly thanks to the way they mix with other clothes and pack so well. For fall, he showed gutsy updates on the asymmetric drapey layering, big, sloppy ribbed knits and distressed-leather looks that are coveted by his horde of traveling warrior women. His jackets—either small and narrow-sleeved or hefty and voluminous—were his star pieces, both done with the big collars that are showing up everywhere this season. A couple of dramatic post-apocalyptic parkas had a shaggy fringe of stuffing spilling from the edge, and a new body-fitting jacket was pieced together in zones of oyster and black pleated distressed satin. Alongside these, Owens recut his signature jacket—high in back, tapering to a point in front—in shearling.</p><p>The collection's news came in the the washed-out baby blue and pink tones that cropped up among the familiar blacks and browns, as well as the thigh-high boots that marched out on flat soles. As a total look, though, nothing much in the Owens universe has changed. His stylistic niche happens to slot in somewhere near the Belgian sensibility; as a Paris debut, it held its own with credibility.</p></div>"
86,fall,2003,f2003,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli set his raucous show against a giant wall of video screens that bore an uncanny resemblance to the ones Sean Combs installed for his New York presentation—where Cavalli himself was a surprise guest. The imagery evoked a dreamy futuristic metropolis out of <em>Blade Runner,</em> but as the pace quickened and the soundtrack throbbed ever louder, it segued into heady images of Hollywood red-carpet awards ceremonies, the Rio carnival and Las Vegas showgirl acts. These are, perhaps, among the select venues where a girl can carry off such raucous Cavalli-isms as a trained hourglass leather dress, cut and decorated like a motocross biker’s jacket. Or a sweeping black Cruella De Vil mink coat with a giant white eagle flapping across the back, worn over a barely there mermaid gown, blown together on a wing and a prayer with the help of myriad black sequins the size of licorice candies.</p><p>The Cavalli girl clearly exists on a plane far removed from common humanity, but there was a giddily seductive let-them-eat-cake bravado to the designer’s madness. He even surfed some of the current trends: ’60s op-art prints; a dash of ’80s punk, in the hand-beaded “graffiti” on skinny-leg jeans and the chunky dog-collar chokers worn with over-the-top rhinestones; the second-skin boot cut crotch-high; and a great take on the season’s ubiquitous crystal-beaded, fringed flapper dress (perfect for a New Age Roxie Hart).</p><p>But the designer was at his most persuasive when he laid claim to escapist Bob Mackie territory with Jayne Mansfield siren gowns in lamé chiffons and a frothy ostrich- and cock-feather bubble coat worn over a Tina Turner sequined mini. Even his classically tailored, shapely jackets were slashed at the sides, his shearling flying jackets cropped short over midriff-baring dresses. As Jacquetta Wheeler swept off the runway in a Moulin Rouge showgirl costume that left little to the imagination (but a whole flock of apricot ostrich plumes in her wake), the rest of Cavalli’s glamazons pranced out wearing Lycra catsuits in vivid Warhol- and Basquiat-inspired prints. Don’t ask me where they’re heading—just make sure to invite me along for the ride.</p></div>"
87,fall,2003,f2003,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens, the prodigiously talented young Belgian, returned to the Paris scene to make his debut at Rochas and bowled over his audience with a show that was nothing short of magnificent. Having leafed through the annals of 1950s Parisian elegance, Theyskens proceeded to redefine the romance of the suit, cocktail dress and grand evening gown in exquisite couture-grade materials, making them relevant for a whole new generation.</p><p>Magical constructions of black Chantilly lace, pink and white taffeta, satin and tulle were melded into shapes and volumes with a dual impact: a respect for the past and the forceful confidence of youth. Tiny skirt suits with narrow shoulders were made in four-tiered silhouettes, consisting of a bolero with a flounce beneath it, then a skirt with another whoosh at the hemline. The spectacular part was in the back, though. Sometimes a frill would start in the sleeve and carry on around the back in a caped furl; other times there was padding or a big bow hidden under lace, which created a swaybacked line unseen since the work of Cristobal Balenciaga.</p><p>Fragile, camisole-strapped satin dresses came with rounded bell skirts, petticoated with tulle; other delicately ingenious variations included pencil skirts with spirals of hacked tulle at the waist or constructed entirely out of what looked like white rose petals. Then came the breathtakingly statuesque entrance-making gowns. One standout came in pink taffeta covered with black Chantilly lace, cut close to the torso but bursting into undulations at the shoulder and below the knee. Throughout, Theyskens threw in details just odd enough to keep predictability at bay: plastic see-through pumps, hand-painted abstract flowers, a jolt of orange leather, a royal-blue glove.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""72h9df""></div></div><p>It was ravishing. By the end Theyskens had wrought a small revolution—a decisive shift in taste away from the worn-out provocations of edgy and sexual. In 20 minutes he’d blown the dust off the words <em>charming</em> and <em>dainty</em> and ushered in a whole new concept of feminine elegance and sophistication.</p></div>"
88,fall,2003,f2003,roland-mouret,"In London, Roland Mouret has become a top name intent on pulling clear of the reputation for amateurism that plagues many of the city’s formative talents. This season, in pursuit of that goal, he embraced the ’60s Courrèges-Cardin groove that’s already surfaced in New York, basing his leggy show around mod minis, space-age cutouts, black, orange and lashings of patent leather. Citing <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> and <em>Metropolis</em> as his references, he sent out a collection that proved he can make clothes with a clean-cut quality, but left a question-mark hanging over a more essential point: the coherence of his personal vision.</p><p>Mouret showed precise little raised-waist wool coats and suits with collars, pocket flaps, tabs and half-belts picked out in black patent leather. His sequence of A-line minidresses, some flipped in the hem, had curvy keyhole leather-banded motifs at the neck, or were completely suspended from complex patent harnesses, Barbarella-style. Fluted knit dresses done in vertical stripes of plain and sheer stitching, floating over an opaque base, seemed softer and more modern. For evening, he switched to pale gray and edged the banded keyholes in pretty, iridescent silver sequin.</p><p>The collection was proof that Mouret can produce a grown-up, pulled-together look with a lot of commercially viable elements, especially the outerwear. The problem was that the empire-line coats seemed to move in the slipstream of Marc Jacobs, and the cutout dresses in the wake of Sophia Kokosalaki’s experiments. Meanwhile, the romantically draped dresses that have become Mouret’s signature were missing. That’s a pity, since they represent his best chance at rising above the crowd.</p></div>"
89,fall,2003,f2003,saint-laurent,"“Color! Fashion! I love it!” said Tom Ford backstage after a show that ended the Fall season in a climax of exuberant, sophisticated, grown-up sexiness. He was looking back, to the 1940s collection that Saint Laurent designed in the ’70s, but also moving things forward, and he hit exactly the right balance with his first outfit: a soft jade silk-velvet jacket, fastened at the side with a satin ribbon, over a flouncy knee-length skirt in a paler green and fishnets finished by Lucite-heeled ankle-strap shoes.</p><p>Ford shook off the muted, slightly tortured mood of his last collection and embraced the vibrant, daring color clashes Saint Laurent used so often—cranberry and red, brown and pale blue, powder pink and black, and the odd vulgar sparkly heeled emerald shoe to throw everything off a bit. He had fun with the idea of Saint Laurent fur by exaggerating the sleeves on a fox coat, dangling whole tails from the wrists and belting it with a stiff plastic bow. That plastic also came out on evening gowns as see-through breastplates and cuffs glittering with diamanté.</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>But that’s not to say this was a complete change of direction. The slinky flippy skirts he showed under jackets last season were the beginning of a train of thought that here flowered into gorgeous ruffles, exposed black lingerie, fur chubbies and a cascade of long evening gowns. Adding to the mood of happy nostalgia, meanwhile, was a red-lipped Karen Elson—her red hair done in a pageboy—black models with afros and a soundtrack courtesy of Diana Ross and the Supremes.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""p3qpln""></div></div><p>So what made this twenty-first-century Tom and not 1970s Yves? The way Ford knocked the stuffing out of what had become an ossified conservative look with a series of cheeky, knowing twists. There’s nothing ladylike about silk-chiffon dresses that are so sheer you can see straight through to the fishnets beneath. About a blouse neckline that dips below the bra. Or the lace-filled cutouts he planted into the flanks of a pair of black leather pants. (If that puts him in line for criticism, it’s worth remembering that once upon a time Saint Laurent himself came under fire for so-called bad taste.) Simply put, there was enough beauty and controversy in this collection to make it a talking point—and a money spinner—for the next six months. Which means Tom Ford has done it again.</p></div>"
90,fall,2003,f2003,sonia-rykiel,"After 41 years, it’s amazing how Sonia Rykiel manages to merge her unchanging aesthetic—soft, body-hugging knits in black with bright spots, floppy hats smashed down on the head, and that very French savoir-faire—with whatever’s current in fashion. So for fall, the black things are turning up appropriately proportioned (trans: short) and layered, with leggings under skirts under bustiers. Rykiel also hit the current idea of the big, soft, fun fur done as a huge bubble of color—in her case, purple knitted fox, or teal-blue Mongolian lamb, cinched in with hip-riding belts. The Rykiel trend summary also includes the biker, in its own way: perhaps as a zippy cream skirt suit, or a leather motorcycle jacket with a huge collar in shearling.</p><p>Paris wouldn’t be Paris without Rykiel's traditional finale: dozens of girls lining up on the runway in her signature stripy knits. Fall's editions are tiny off-the-shoulder or tube top and worn with flouncy net tutus. But when the Michael Jackson was cued up, and the girls tried to work up a few awkward dance moves, the upbeat eighties theme took a bad stumble.</p></div>"
91,fall,2003,f2003,sophia-kokosalaki,"Curvy, ivory, anatomically pieced dresses, sometimes overrun with raised top-seaming like contour lines on a map: these were the opening statements by which Sophia Kokosalaki announced a change of direction. For a couple of seasons, the designer has been too caught up with complicated cutouts, strung together with folk-derived macramé from her Greek heritage. Now she’s working out a new way of conveying her distinctive signature, cleaning up silhouettes with her own brand of futurism. A child of the ’80s, Kokosalaki admits that the costumes in <em>Star Trek</em> made an impression on her. Others might connect her latest move with the admiration for Azzedine Alaïa and the Mugler/Montana era that is currently in the air. Either way, what sets her apart is a design integrity that keeps her from making literal reinterpretations.</p><p>For fall, Kokosalaki synthesized the lessons and experiments of her past collections with a cleaner, more body-conscious look. Her cutouts, for instance, were replaced by patches of pleated metallic leather or flattened frills, implanted in necklines or at the hips, so that the motif now reads like a pattern of gilded wings. Further into the show, she developed that idea into a whole leather skirt, done in pleated tiers of copper and pewter leather. The real achievement of this collection, however, was that she never allowed herself to be distracted by the details. Kokosalaki’s strongest stroke was the definition of a concise proportion, cutting all her hemlines—dresses and coats included—to four inches above the knee and rebalancing the silhouette with the tendency to a wider shoulder. Some of her boxy coat-jackets came with military epaulets and were shown with leggings and high boots, others as glamorous edge-to-edge clutch coats with volume in the shoulder line.</p><p>Overall, though, it’s the chic femininity of Kokosalaki’s work—her love of developing form-flattering dresses and the ability to adjust her vision without losing her identity—that marks her out as a fast-maturing talent.</p></div>"
92,fall,2003,f2003,stella-mccartney,"Stella McCartney sent along rose-colored glasses with the invitations to her show this season, but they really weren't necessary. The charm of her show was visible to the naked eye. Strict tweed pencil skirts worn with blousy cropped satin jackets in pinks and mauves were a modern version of sexy secretary glamour. Ribbed wool trims and tight techno-fiber pants that looked like something you'd see on a snowboarder's half-pipe lent an air of sporty sophistication.</p><p>Models walked to a hip-hoppy remix of ""My Favorite Things,"" in which the mundane yearnings for ""brown paper packages tied up with string"" had been replaced with more glamorous listings: ""diamonds and rubies and Stella's dresses."" That must have referred to the pretty silk cocktail frocks that closed the show. Done in flower-petal colors with rows of pinkie-size crystals, they're surefire candidates to become the favorite things of party girls from London to L.A.</p><p>Yet for all the icy elegance, there was the feeling that something was missing from this collection. Perhaps it was the youthful, cheeky edge that's made the designer a fashion favorite with the kind of woman who will throw an old hoodie sweatshirt over a fresh-off-the-runway dress. This season, with too much tricky Alaïa-inspired tailoring, McCartney seems to be trying too hard. And that, among the seen-it-all crowd that travels in those casually chic circles, is definitely a no-no.</p></div>"
93,fall,2003,f2003,tommy-hilfiger,"A fan of all things British, Tommy Hilfiger has a particular soft spot for the mod era's crisp lines, powerful graphics and great music. That means the current trend for early-’60s fashion plays to his strengths, and the result was a smart, appealing fall collection.</p><p>As the Kinks, the Who and the Beatles played at earsplitting volume, Hilfiger sent out short, white A-line dresses made from space-age materials like neoprene and Teflon, worn with Courreges-inspired flat silver boots and boxy short jackets or mink hoodies. He cut pants tight and seamed, in the style of vintage skiwear, and topped his looks with silvery oversize anoraks, white motorcycle jackets and funnel-neck short coats. Hilfiger also worked plenty of shiny patent leather into the collection, as an accent or in great pieces such as a slick leather car coat and skinny white pants. With two exceptions—a bold red coat and skirt shown at the end—the palette stayed white, black or navy. Hilfiger clearly knows not only the era, but also just how his customer wants it interpreted.</p></div>"
94,fall,2003,f2003,undercover,"Jun Takahashi’s Spring collection left the audience with the impression that the young Japanese designer is a burning rebel with a sociopolitical point to make. So his invitation, printed on cutout figures, had people puzzling over what edgy direction he might take for fall. In the end, though, the concept wasn’t an intellectual mind bender, but the simple conceit of dressing paper dolls.</p><p>The whimsical show started with a pair of girls who wandered out wearing printed tabard dresses with long gloves, hair in off-kilter up-dos, eyes shaded by twisted metal cocktail veils, and lips tinted blue and green. They paused, and then one unfolded half a raw-edged tweed suit and stuck it to the other with Velcro tabs. The stick-on clothes had a suburban ladylikeness, all polka-dot blouses, dressmaker-y frocks and fake-fur coats. These sliced-off secondary outfits got attached to everyday sportswear, like sweats and cargo pants with vast pockets, and accessorized with photo-printed cutouts of necklaces, watches and corsages. It was cute at first, but once it was clear that no further twists were going to develop, the show dragged on a bit.</p><p>“Last season’s theme was very heavy, so I wanted to do something lighter,” Takahashi said afterward. Fall’s idea, and its arty execution, puts him somewhere along the avant-garde continuum that includes Junya Watanabe, Viktor &amp; Rolf and Bernhard Willhelm. Which, after all, is an interesting place to be.</p></div>"
95,fall,2003,f2003,valentino,"Dim nightclub lighting and a dirgelike soundtrack set an uncharacteristically downbeat tone at Valentino and seemed an odd foil to the ladylike clothes on parade. These were strongest when they played with themes from the house’s Spring couture collection and showcased the extraordinary detailing of which even Valentino’s ready-to-wear workrooms are capable.</p><p>There was no shortage of stellar effects. Concentric circles of mink on the bishop sleeve of a shapely jacket suggested an archery target. An evening bodice, worn over a sunburst-pleated satin gown in the designer’s brilliant fetish red, bristled with singly mounted ostrich fronds. Bead embroidery was swagged across cocktail dresses to mimic lavish Edwardian necklaces. And there were plenty of the insouciant gestures that Valentino’s well-heeled customers relish, from the frothy ivory lace-and-chiffon lingerie blouses worn with black cocktail skirts to the marled knit cardigan coat fashioned for a Bloomsbury beauty and shrugged over bohemian ’30s beads. He also caught something of the 1940s spirit that has infused this season’s war-menaced collections. But pleated flippy skirts and neat hourglass jackets, swirled with curlicues of padded satin, evoked a young Duchess of Windsor rather than the sexed-up chanteuse singing “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy” that some other designers have taken as their muse.</p><p>As always, Valentino seemed to have an eye on Oscar’s red carpet, sending out siren gowns lavished with pretty Lalique-esque dragonfly embroideries and a showgirl-style flapper costume drenched in lilac bugle beads. It is difficult, however, to imagine where his diva is heading in an overscale chiffon sweater thickly banded with Mongolian lamb—a fondue party in Saint Moritz, perhaps? Then again, if anyone knows the quirks of those lunching ladies, it is Valentino.</p></div>"
96,fall,2003,f2003,vera-wang,"Vera Wang sustained the coolly wistful feeling of her spring show with a lovely Asian-tinged collection for fall.</p><p>Although best known for her evening looks, Wang has clearly been putting some thought into daywear, opening her show with a slim black coat whose three-quarter sleeves and low belt whispered an early ’60s elegance. Other sportswear pieces, like a great ivory goatskin coat, or a black cashmere shell and slim skirt, were judiciously embellished with a glimmer of beads, a bit of swinging passementerie or a bar of origami-folded ribbon. Some were topped with adorable shrugs made from fur or cashmere, or knitted with popcorn. Wang also did long and short versions of sexy silk jersey dresses, including one strappy number she called a bondage dress—although if that's bondage, Debra Messing is a dominatrix.</p><p>The modern dilemma for eveningwear, as recent red carpets have made all too obvious, is how to achieve glamour and sophistication without falling into old-and-fussy or new-and-weird. Wang has that problem solved: A pale-gray chiffon gown, cut in the time-honored plunge-neck style, gets a fresh treatment via raw seams; a high mandarin collar makes a satin dress stand out; and a taupe gown made from the webbiest open-work lace enhances without overwhelming—which could well be this designer’s motto.</p></div>"
97,fall,2003,f2003,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho designs clothes with her fellow women in mind, appealing to a feminine sense of what’s pretty and what works. The result is a refreshing lack of flashy, over-the-top sexiness, a chic, bookish, often delicious decorum holding sway instead. This season was no exception, as Branquinho delivered on all her signature looks: leggings worn with knee-high boots, V-neck cocktail slips, tweedy knee-length skirts, woven crisscross straps and a mostly muted palette.</p><p>She opened the show with a grouping of smartest-girl-at-the-party black dresses, slim pants and inventive overcoats—one with long, loose, knee-skimming sleeves and another that incorporated a structured capelet that hit at the elbow. Things soon lightened up with subtly twinkling rose-petal dresses, which, Branquinho said later, were inspired by her recent fascination with ice-dancing competitions. They then loosened up via chunky toggle-closure cardigans and knee-length pleated kilts that recalled the <em>Love Story</em>–era Ali MacGraw. Highly covetable windowpane-plaid shirtdresses had an equally ’70s collegiate feel; they conjured visions of a longhaired grad student throwing on one of her boyfriend’s well-worn button-downs and cinching it with a folksy leather belt before heading off to her advanced existentialism seminar.</p><p>What distinguished this collection from Branquinho past, however, was the higher level of elegance. There was a new sparkle—in the black dresses embroidered with silver thread, in the shimmering Lurex ballerina sweaters and in the thin jersey tops painted with gleaming platinum flames. It was as if the intellectual Belgian had taken a well-deserved break from her studies to hit the disco—or, at least, the skating rink.</p></div>"
98,fall,2003,f2003,versace,"Donatella Versace's strong suit is just that: her slim, mean tailoring for the rock-star wife who has graduated to a more sophisticated phase of her life. She's moved beyond road trips and hanging around backstage; now she lives uptown and drops the kids off at school in the limo, on her way to a day of lunch and shopping.</p><p>Maybe she’s settling down, but she still wants her style with some attitude. Versace knows how to do that. She loves a wild Western fringe or a big, mad dyed fur, but she can also take care of the more quotidian needs of the rock and celebrity aristocracy. She cuts a fine beige pantsuit, a white pencil skirt and a belted caramel coat with distinction, and throws in an oversize squashy ostrich bag as an enough-said status accessory. About-town daywear can also include an amped-up couture-detailed biker jacket, maybe in pink leather or black satin, with patches of ribbing and crisscross lacing on the sleeve and up the back.</p><p>At night, of course, there's bound to be a red carpet or two. Versace's solutions came in multiple variations of the knockout corset dress. In strong color, like absinthe or red, or more muted ivory and lingerie pink, they were boned and fitted like a second skin, trailing cascades of chiffon in the skirts. Still, even her dresses couldn't distract from the impact of another idea: a definitive tux, lean in the jacket and with the skinniest possible pants. It's the kind of simple, powerful statement that separates the women from the girls.</p></div>"
99,fall,2003,f2003,versus-versace,"Hair ratted into an insane mane, body poured into a multicolor repertoire of spray-on pieces, the Versus chick has morphed into an outrageous cyber-biker on speed. Donatella Versace calls her prot¿g¿’s look “sophisticated toughness with couture references and a nod to Hells Angels and motocross daredevils.” She’s out there high-stepping through the fall trends—leggings, cycle jackets, anatomically-constructed patchworks of color—in bright leather and satin spiky boots laden with chains.</p><p>Her revved-up day-time wardrobe runs to sculptured jackets with second-skin jersey leggings or tight microminidresses with patches of turquoise, royal blue and white, or clashes of orange, pink and cranberry pieced together like a speed cyclist's suit. Sometimes she'll throw in the odd alternative moment via a few pseudo-proper black bouclé coats, but that’s just a passing fancy. This girl hits her stride somewhere way after midnight, and a silver leather coat banded with yellow fur and matching gauntlets will get her exactly where she wants to be: way, way beyond.</p></div>"
100,fall,2003,f2003,viktor-rolf,"Copper-haired and milk-pale, British actress Tilda Swinton appeared at Viktor &amp; &amp; Rolf in a slightly different role from her usual turn. As designer muse, Swinton strolled down the runway in a black pantsuit with a deep, swooping curve of a collar to the soundtrack of her own cut-glass voice advising, “Follow your own path.” That was the opening scene of a return performance of the Dutch double-act's finest ideas, distilled over a decade. ""It's our tenth anniversary already,"" said Viktor Horsting. ""We wanted to do all our signatures, with the menswear and the couture influences, for an ageless modern woman.""</p><p>By focusing on dressing Tilda—an army of Tildas, in fact—the collection elegantly bridged the divide between high concept and wearability. Every model was made over as a Swinton clone, then put into revisited versions of the white shirts, jeans, tailoring, bourgeois dresses and exploding multilayer shapes that have marked Viktor &amp; Rolf's greatest hits.</p><p>The calmed-down experimentalism panned out into an exceptional kind of refinement, perfectly in sync with the current mood. Face-framing lapels and collars (a look of the season) were set into everything from jean jackets to parkas and mannish shirts. Pewter and black satin shirtdresses with slashed sleeves, ribbed trapunto collars, shoulder patches and zip-up pockets walked a delicate line between ladylike and hip. A quiet gray chiffon column over a brown T-shirt, tethered with a slim leather belt, was one of the coolest notions of evening dress for fall.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""j76wch""></div></div><p>Scattered among these were incredible attention grabbers. Pushing layering and falling-off-the-shoulder to their conceptual limits, Viktor &amp; Rolf made outfits with five shirt collars peeling back, one atop the other. One girl appeared with eight men's jackets stacked on her shoulders. A giant, inflated silk-moiré bubble acted as a bolero–cum–down jacket on another. These were all insider references to the body of work the avant-garde pair has amassed up to now. The excitement was seeing how they channeled all that originality into the real world.</p></div>"
101,fall,2003,f2003,wink,"So what if Wink's show, held on a frigid night in a cramped East Village office/gallery, started late and didn't have any seats? The downtown girls who love these funky, unfussy clothes don't care about sitting down.</p><p>For his part, Wink designer Wynn Smith wisely limited the collection to 16 well-edited looks, shown on a frieze of models standing on a narrow platform. The proximity allowed for close inspection of his distinguishing characteristics: the delicately frayed black jersey trim on a grey flannel shift, for example, or a witty sweater-coat styled to resemble a trench. Smith also showed a sure hand in styling, lending his outfits an extra dimension by playing off fragile fabrics against denser materials—corduroy with chiffon, twill with voile, chunky knits with flimsy pieces.</p><p>Wink is one of the few young fashion designers not itching to be an avant-garde darling. He seems more interested in the subtle art of injecting originality into fashion's tried-and-true formulas. Judging from his hipster following, the effort is paying off.</p></div>"
102,fall,2003,f2003,y-3,"It's a label that was built from the ground up, literally. Yohji Yamamoto's Y-3 line started with those perpetually sold-out, incredibly cool sneakers. Now in its second season as a fully head-to-toe collection, Yamamoto's collaboration with Adidas (the Y is for Yohji, the 3 for the triple stripe that trims the athletic brand’s classic shoes and tracksuits) is proving something that Venus and Serena Williams have been trying to tell us for years: tweaked properly, sports clothes can be fashion.</p><p>This season's collection was full of track pants that were tailored like trousers (miniature pleats and all) and black leather-and-wool baseball jackets, cut just slightly too large to be considered standard issue. The white-on-black Adidas stripes were twisted around pant legs and morphed into gold military-officer-style Vs on the sleeves of great toggle coats and slim black hoodies. Cargo pants, which we thought we'd seen the end of after the Spring collections, looked entirely fresh—cut full from silky parachute fabric and cinched at the ankle to form a soft balloon shape.</p><p>And yes, there were brand-new trainers to lust after, this time in mirror-bright silver and glittery ruby-slipper red. Yamamoto said he was inspired by the young people who show up to work at his atelier every day in sporty street-chic clothes. No wonder, then, that the collection artfully summed up that hip-hop-meets-skater-boy-meets-old-school-prep aesthetic that fashion-obsessed under-30 types can't seem to get enough of right now.</p></div>"
103,fall,2003,f2003,yohji-yamamoto,"Sprinting ahead of the rest of the pack by showing his Fall/Winter 2003 ready-to-wear line during couture, Yohji Yamamoto took a few graphic, classic motifs and skewed them with his vision of what he calls ""couture that could be worn on the street."" Working mainly around black-and-white houndstooth fabrics, varying from bold checks to finer menswear wools, he used this collection to merge masculine tailoring and feminine shapeliness into layered silhouettes. The result: daywear with a soupçon of the Dior-esque '50s and a dash of punkish detail, cut with Yamamoto's original twists on pattern and structure.</p><p>Generous checked coats with voluminous sleeves hugged the waist and ended in shaggy fringe. Skirts pleated like kilts came layered over punky leggings in print chiffon and flat, pointed leather boots. Large checked scarves were wound around necklines and trailed off with a certain Parisian dash. Yohji's enduring tastes for Edwardiana and rocker styling showed up too, in sculpted peplum jackets, trenches and black leather motorcycle jackets. But it was the leanest, simplest pieces, like a slightly padded black jacket wound with a matching scarf, that proved his argument for clothes that can walk coolly off the runway and out onto the sidewalk.</p></div>"
104,fall,2003,f2003,zac-posen,"The Pool Room at the Four Seasons. Nerve center of the global power-broker network, icon of luxurious modern design, mecca for the rich and famous—and the site of Zac Posen’s third show. Yes, he’s come a long way from the dark, drafty former synagogue on the Lower East Side where he made his debut.</p><p>Well connected, socially visible and—most important—possessed of a distinct design sensibility, 22-year-old Posen has become one of the week’s hotter tickets. That, plus the major sponsors he scored this season (Swarovski, L’Oréal, Belvedere vodka and Shiseido, among others), perhaps explains how he got one of the city’s most prominent restaurants to shut down for the night, and every major model including Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen to report for duty. And although the show started nearly an hour late, Posen’s fall collection delivered a pretty, if sometimes repetitive, message to the A-list crowd (Claire Danes, China Chow).</p><p>Judging from the location and the backers, Posen’s interest in business is growing, and he’s developing new breadth in his collection as a result. He showed more daytime clothing, like slim tweed pantsuits, cotton piqué shirts, delicate blouses made from shredded, mitered strips of voile, and some great coats (a coppery trench with an oversize capelet top; a cheerful hooded jacket whose fur trim ran over the head and down the spine, ending in a tail). But while Posen was more sparing in his use of signature touches like bias draping, handkerchief hems and meticulously pieced skirts, his glee for glamorous eveningwear is unquenchable. He used a map-printed silk crepe for fluttery halter dresses, draped Christensen in a beautiful purple satin gown and sent Alek Wek out in a Vegas-worthy “dress” made from strands of sparkling rhinestones worn over a black thong. The Pool Room has never looked so good.</p></div>"
105,fall,2003,f2003,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo came out of her shell for fall, showing her most focused, confident collection to date. Her mantra? Sleek, neat, chic. Inspired by <em>Blade Runner</em>, the pieces showcased the designer's tailoring skills. Cornejo offered a fresh variation on the traditional jacket and skirt combination by streamlining vests and skirts. Many of her dresses and jackets had interesting geometric or cape-like sleeve details that lightly referenced both sci-fi and the '80s without veering into kitsch. Likewise, hooded and cocoon jackets worn over slim-as-legging pants evoked the artfulness of Geoffrey Beene and early Comme des Gar¿ons rather than <em>Barbarella</em>. Cornejo enlivened her serious palette of black and grey with ivory and neon green, and strict tailoring was offset by a riff of draped dresses. While zippers and hoodies added a note of sportiness, Cornejo's sophisticated coats summed up the discipline and sophistication of the collection as a whole.</p></div>"
1,spring,2004,s2004,a-f-vandevorst,"“We used paper to research new shapes,” said An Vandevorst backstage after the Spring 2004 presentation. “But we liked the effect so much we decided to use it in the show,” added her husband and design partner Filip Arickx. And use it they did, opening with a simple brown paper mac followed by a series of increasingly complex concoctions in the same “fabric”: a jacket whose sleeves were hoisted up with leather straps, a skirt with layers of jigsaw-puzzle pleats. The experiment was then echoed in more-accessible white cotton.</p><p>Super-luxurious materials may not be A.F. Vandevorst’s thing, but clever construction certainly is—and that needn’t mean stiff and complicated. Witness a pristine white cotton shirtdress, or a pair of super-skinny, zippered pants in the palest suede, or a simple chocolate canvas trench. A chiffon dress printed with plumes was, quite literally, as light as a feather; a pea-green jersey dress was sliced down the back to reveal a flash of bare spine. Even their print, in the form of an arty, abstract paisley looked—heaven forbid!—almost chic.</p></div>"
2,spring,2004,s2004,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti's slight, pretty collection confirmed her ongoing love affair with chiffon. Although the show opened with a full-skirted frock in cocoa satin smudged with a shadowy green rose print—perfect for a royal garden party in the fifties—Ferretti modernized the quaint vintage look with flat sandals and a tattered wisp of chiffon engirdling the waist.</p><p>It was a taste of things to come, as the designer brought on an endless parade of airy nothings in her fetish fabric, made lighter still with the raw, unfinished edges she celebrates. Angelic little dresses were composed of layer upon layer of mousseline, like a mille-feuille pastry; or sweetened with piecrust frills; or embellished with vertical panels that wafted in the breeze from the sun-dappled park beyond the tent’s draped curtains. The audience seemed to be experiencing some collective déjà vu, perhaps because many of these dresses so closely evoked the fey frocks with which the designer closed her diffusion Philosophy line earlier this week in Milan.</p><p>Although Ferretti’s prints—giant tone-on-tone blooms with a hand-painted feel, or marbled effects like the endpapers used by Florentine bookbinders—were some of the subtlest of the spring shows, her palette conformed to the pungent color mix so popular this season. Layerings of cardigans or suede mod coats over diaphanous blouses and skirts produced arresting combinations like carrot and magenta, copper and amethyst, and peridot and cherry; and Ferretti saved the best till last with a dramatic finale of enchanting goddess gowns in ravishing Pre-Raphaelite hues.</p></div>"
3,spring,2004,s2004,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Alessandro Dell'Acqua has always fixated on the fragile interplay of chiffon pieces and lingerie, rustling up the kind of outfits a cooler sort of girl would assemble for going out. With that idea front and center this season, Dell'Acqua is in his element—and it's come at just the right moment, as he's hit a new high in his business.</p><p>His treatment of summer's favorite (but inherently tricky) shades of beige, nude, and vintage-boudoir pink came as pretty little sheer ruched camisole tops and tattered, asymmetrically-ruffled dresses. Dell'Acqua has developed a neat strategy for making sheerness wearable: His fine-knit underpinnings create an opaque base over which to layer and tie all those chiffons, a blush-saving trick that turns a certain light eroticism into a realistic proposition.</p><p>Dell'Acqua said he was inspired by actress Monica Vitti, and the cream lace shifts sprinkled with crystals at neck and hem that he showed for evening were a modernized, attractively offhand version of her sixties glamour. The outfits using black tulle layered over jewels looked too close to the original idea by Alber Elbaz to pass critical muster, however. For the most part, this was a confident collection that shows Dell'Acqua growing up. As the creative mind behind La Perla's ready-to-wear, and with a new backer for his own line, chances are there will be a lot more Dell'Acqua in the shops soon—and that's something to look forward to.</p></div>"
4,spring,2004,s2004,alexander-mcqueen,"It takes a showman like Alexander McQueen to get the lifeblood pumping back into fashion performance. His show—staged in the Salle Wagram, a nineteenth-century Parisian dance hall—was an exuberantly hilarious reenactment of Sydney Pollack’s Depression-era film <em>They Shoot Horses, Don't They?</em> Choreographed by Michael Clark over two weeks of intensive rehearsals in London, the narrative involved dancers, models, and audience in a visceral celebration of exquisitely glamorous clothes.</p><p>In the opening scene, the girls entered—dancing for all they were worth on the arms of muscle-bound sailors and hunky hopefuls—dressed in fishtailed silver lamé, figure-hugging cha-cha dresses, and show-stopping gowns with spangled bodices and huge feathered skirts. Other competitors whirled on wearing pink corseted tulle tutus over gray ballet sweats; mint satin tap-suits; or a slinky confection of gray checkerboard chiffon. A Billie Holiday look-alike, dramatically vamping in pink charmeuse and ostrich, vied for attention as flashy bodysuited showgirls were energetically twirled aloft by their partners.</p><p>McQueen’s signatures—elaborately pieced tailoring (now beautifully softened with delicate inserts of lingerie) and body-hugging denims spliced onto nude tulle—also did star turns. The pace picked up even further in the elimination race, in which morphed-together fluorescent chiffons and sports pieces ran hell-for-leather (on impossibly high heels) in a hotly contested dash around the room.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""kvz6ee""></div></div><p>There was even an opening for daywear. Blue-collar marathon survivors staggered out wearing plaid shirts, coats, and skirts made from quilts and recycled patchworks of shirting material, all crafted to the McQueen sex-bomb template. The show reached its climax as a lone exhausted dancer in a silver sequined gown mock-expired center stage. As she was carried off by the designer and his choreographer, thunderous applause rocked the hall.</p></div>"
5,spring,2004,s2004,andrew-gn,"""For me, spring/summer is always about happy, merry clothes,"" said Andrew Gn, practically an understatement given the powerful, punchy prints—polka dots and blossoms galore—that bloomed large throughout his collection.</p><p>Out trooped his ladies, à la Catherine Deneuve in <em>Belle de Jour</em>—all shades and chignons, patent heels and lashings of scarlet lipstick—to the sound of Annie Lennox belting out: ""I was born an original sinner."" Things started out prim with polite cotton coat-dresses, their seams traced with ribbon, then got naughtier thanks to pleated minidresses in red, lilac, sunflower yellow, and coral. But Gn really hit his stride with outfits that combined his exceptional sense of print, color, and decoration. A red polka-dot shirt, say, was worn with a circle skirt (fast becoming <em>the</em> piece of the season) boasting great bunches of hydrangeas; there were silk jackets bursting with roses, ruffled shirts dappled with daisies, and jackets that buttoned with fluttering poppies.</p><p>Spectacular crystal and glass creations by famed costume jeweler Robert Goossens contributed to the already vibrant mix: glossy belts, dramatic bracelets, and necklaces holding up pretty halterneck dresses. Wear Gn to a summer garden party? Absolutely—if you want to see heads swivel in your direction.</p></div>"
6,spring,2004,s2004,ann-demeulemeester,"When the rest of fashion is running in the direction of color, glamour, and lighthearted frilliness, where does a woman who believes in black, androgynous layering, lived-in leather, and symbolic slogans go? She could just keep on walking with sister Ann. Ms. Demeulemeester is not about to renounce a lifetime’s work just because of the season’s dominant trends. On the other hand, Demeulemeester is a sensitive designer who recognizes a change in the air.</p><p>For summer, she added white to her favorite spectrum of darks, and searched for a way to express the tendency toward shortness and flounce in skirts. One solution had her adding puffy cargo pockets to her favorite hip wraps and coats, letting them trail floppily beneath the hemline. She also made her signature leathers as airy as possible, slashing them with concertina cuts until they were as fine as paper mesh, and layering them among the washed satins and chiffons.</p><p>As a nod to optimism, she sent out an enlarged rose print (done in black and white) and T-shirts with “’Til Roses” written in mirror-image graffiti. She even forced herself to send out a single outfit in a muted, sanded orange, though she admitted backstage that it had been a struggle. “I searched for a long, long time for this color,” she laughed. “I was afraid it would be too much.”</p></div>"
7,spring,2004,s2004,anna-molinari,"For her Spring 2004 show, Anna Molinari designer Rosella Tarabini imagined a romantic girl putting together a look for Glastonbury, the English summer music festival which these days is less about mud and sleeping bags than it is about VIP tents and paparazzi. Tarabini dipped into granny’s attic for a haul of lacy, vintage-style dresses and lingerie layers, cut off at the thigh and worn with flat fringed moccasin boots. Done in fragile cream and dusty pink, these pieces were embellished with precious flower embroideries, crystal beading, or the odd little layer of feather cropping up among the flounces in the skirts. Cover-ups came in the form of tweedy, beige, Chanel-like coats and jackets that appeared to have been run through the wash several times in order to look suitably secondhand.</p><p>Tarabani added a touch of grit to the mix with what she described as “tribal” accessories (shell-festooned leather belts and crafty necklaces) and a section of black, Patti Smith–inspired washed leather jeans, suede tabards, and oversized chiffon tops. But for the most part this is, as always, a collection of dresses for pretty young things, with a seasonal twist to keep it all current. The sheer repetition made for something of a trance-inducing performance, but it’s a sweet enough groove for a summer night’s fantasy.</p></div>"
8,spring,2004,s2004,anna-sui,"Anna Sui is clearly in the throes of a heavy-duty blue crush. Her spring collection was centered on the modern teenage surfer girl—a descendant of the Gidgets of yore, just as feminine but far more independent, with a stubborn hippie streak.</p><p>The Sui girl has her priorities in order. Her wardrobe starts with a bikini, a surf shirt, or a pair of lace-edged board shorts; after that, anything is fair game. If she’s heading to a club or a party, she might drop a delicate baby-doll mini on top, tie on a printed apron dress, or wrap up in a short daisy-print canvas trench. If she’s got a serious social engagement, she might switch to a pretty gold shift dress, or zip on some black beaded jams. She’s got a yen for the psychedelic era, judging by the swirling flower and paisley prints and the mind-bending color combinations: pink with orange, lavender with blue, turquoise with green. Everything’s always worn with piles of shell jewelry, and fragile sandals or clear plastic Mary Janes.</p><p>Of course, the runway is the designer’s playground, but Sui’s collection isn’t all fantasy. With her trim trenches, sheer hoodies, and pretty little floral dresses, even women who don’t spend their days making waves will find plenty to get stoked.</p></div>"
9,spring,2004,s2004,anne-klein,"Seismic shifts seem to be a trend this season, and it’s not a hemline movement. Anne Klein, in the process of changing ownership, named a new designer after Charles Nolan announced he was leaving to campaign for Democratic presidential candidate Governor Howard Dean. His replacement, Michael Smaldone, debuted with a spring collection that added a bit of edge to his predecessor’s aesthetic, without veering off wildly in a new direction.</p><p>Smaldone’s theme was “urban nymph,” and he set the mood by paving his runway with wood chips (not the best surface for high heels, as the models soon discovered). Working with a limited palette—white, yellow, black, and khaki, with a few plum-toned accents—he kept silhouettes simple, with pencil skirts, tailored jackets cropped above the wrist, and full-cut white shirts tucked into slim pants or shorts.</p><p>The designer attached a high leather waistband to a few pants and skirts, used hook and eyes up the back of a skirt, and lavished silver beading in unexpected places—on a khaki tunic over cropped pants, and on an A-line skirt paired with a yellow striped shirt. While he may have chosen classic lines, clearly he likes a vivid detail.</p></div>"
10,spring,2004,s2004,as-four,"As Four are almost as well known for their lifestyle (they share a communal bed in a silver-painted loft) as for their innovative silhouettes. Hard-to-miss and easy-to-love regulars on the New York City party circuit, Adi, Ange, Gabi, and Kai showcased their singular vision in the Bryant Park tents for the first time this season.</p><p>The design collective conjured a fairy-tale world, with a Ben Brunnemer soundtrack that ranged from Nico to break beats and a palette that mixed gold, pastels, and jewel tones and was embellished with amoeba-shaped paillettes and appliqués. Despite the copious amounts of Swarovski sparkle, however, shape was the most dazzling element of the show, with garments slinking, slithering, and blooming around the body in feats of engineering that recalled Paul Poiret’s famous lampshade dresses. Pants were rendered in infinite variety—enlivened with zips, twists, insets, and asymmetries—while tunics, jackets, and accessories took on an array of extravagant, organic forms. The over-the-top quotient was certainly high, but there were also plenty of wearable pieces among the <em>Arabian Nights</em>–style fantasy. The exotic appeal of a headdress hung with tear-shaped panels that functioned as a top, for example, was tempered by the almost classical restraint of a pleated, toga-style dress. The closing look, a fetishlike gold bodysuit that extended to the face and feet of a model who was leading (or being led by) As Four’s pit bull, Powder (in matching gold capelet), proved a fittingly gilded end to a show that evidenced the group’s Midas touch.</p></div>"
11,spring,2004,s2004,badgley-mischka,"Badgley Mischka is sure to see some of its designs show up at the Emmys this weekend, but its star-studded show was a performance in itself, with dueling photographers nearly coming to blows over access to Bebe Neuwirth and Cynthia Nixon in the front row. The Trumps (Blaine, and Donald with Melania) were also in attendance, along with Kelly Klein and Toni Braxton; but the jewels in the crown (and how they sparkled!) were Beyoncé (in a floral-print bustier with rhinestone beading, and chandelier earrings) and Jay-Z (tee, jeans, and Nikes, plus a serious gold watch).</p><p>Mark Badgley and James Mischka's inspiration was Maggie, the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>, and music producer Javier Peral spliced sound bites from the movie into a mix that also featured Marilyn Manson and Goldfrapp. The clothes, however, seemed more suited for a Russian princess with a fondness for Fabergé, dripping as they were with pearls, beads, sequins, and all matter of glitter—a kind of tribute to craftsmanship over subtlety. Some of the prettiest looks were the most restrained, like a washed chiffon gown in a color described by the program notes as “thistle” and the georgette dresses in Easter-egg hues that closed the show. The stand-out piece was a white frayed chiffon dress that gave the effect of ribbon-like strips woven together by tiny, magic hands.</p><p>When Donna Summer's <em>Working the Midnight Shift</em> came on the soundtrack (“I'm just a working girl, just earning a living…working that midnight shift for that extra little something”) it offered a tongue-in-cheek take on a collection aimed at celebrities whose job it is to look good on the red carpet. Nice work if you can get it.</p></div>"
12,spring,2004,s2004,balenciaga,"Amazing anatomy: that’s what one needs to acquire before even thinking about Balenciaga for spring. Nicholas Ghesquière’s hourglass suits are all rump-hugging to-the-knee skirt, cinched torso, and assertive shoulder, with raised seams running over every contour. High-collared, multi-buttoned cadet jackets, in glove-smooth putty leather or pristine cream canvas, come nipped at the waist, or with the shoulders shaped on the curve and doubly emphasized by tiny boleros. “I wanted to contrast structure and fluidity,” he said. “Things that give power to femininity.”</p><p>This sculptured, futuristic/militaristic silhouette marches to a beat not heard since Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana stalked the eighties Paris runways. But there was more: Ghesquière followed his couture—like, neutral tailoring with short, flounced cutaway dresses in vivid colors and flower prints, delicately suspended over neoprene bras. A highly feminine conflation of his previous experiments with patchwork, some of these pieces were collages of powder-pink corsetry and fluted fuchsia chiffon, floating over, say, a lime-green bra. Others, in old-fashioned flower prints, ended in curly ruffles, weighted with zippers in the hems.</p><p>Whittled down to twenty-six outfits, this was a small but perfectly formed design statement. None of Balenciaga’s beloved pants and T-shirts made the edit, but hopes are high they’re somewhere in the back.</p></div>"
13,spring,2004,s2004,bcbg-max-azria,"It would be all too easy for the soft-spoken femininity that’s dominating New York’s spring collections to go wrong. A little too much lace, a few too many bows, and poof!—sugar has turned to saccharine. In one of the season’s more refreshing collections, Max Azria demonstrated a sure hand with the trend, showing a distinctive, individual take on what’s becoming well-trodden terrain.</p><p>Instead of the same Easter-basket pastels, Azria chose an unusual palette featuring a twenties color scheme of deep rosy pink, aquamarine, pale chartreuse, black, and ivory. He added big floral prints reminiscent of Dagobert Peche’s Wiener Werkstätte designs, and balanced retro-looking fabrics like lightweight cotton voile and washed twill with modern nylon and Lycra blends. The silhouettes were clean and easy: A-line dresses that skimmed the body, cropped pants, short jackets with three-quarter sleeves, and thigh-length coats.</p><p>Azria delivered charm aplenty—particularly via the tiny ruffles that he stacked on the pretty bikini tops and bottoms, scattered on a minidress, and used to line the edges of a camisole neckline or hem a pair of Clamdiggers. Like a good cook with a tricky recipe, the designer knew just when to stop fussing with his fashion.</p></div>"
14,spring,2004,s2004,behnaz-sarafpour,"For Spring 2004, Behnaz Sarafpour jettisoned the sotto voce sweetness of her ladylike Fall line and replaced it with an aggressively sexy stance—a change in direction so dramatic, it might provoke a few cases of fashion whiplash.</p><p>The opening look set the tone: Karolina Kurkova striding out in high heels, a tight topknot, and a short, snug, strapless black dress made from rib knit and patent leather. Sarafpour followed with more of the same, featuring pencil skirts with patent panels; skintight pants; and black blouson jackets cut to hit just below the ribs, all layered over knit tops. She wrapped satin bustiers over dresses and rib-knit tanks, and made short trench coats from slick white or black patent.</p><p>This designer has a witty sense of proportion, which showed up in pieces like the black satin camisole with a loose, loopy bow; the tiny boleros encrusted with big sequins; and the cheerfully chic, oversize gingham taffeta blouses. But when a lovely, body-skimming pink satin dress appeared on the runway, it seemed to have wandered in from a different collection entirely.</p></div>"
15,spring,2004,s2004,betsey-johnson,"A year ago, Betsey Johnson was in a reflective mood; she’d just turned 60 and, with a new vacation home in Mexico to tempt her, was hinting that she might be ready to step back from the day-to-day fashion grind. Yeah, right. In the intervening twelve months, Johnson has launched a secondary label called Betseyville; signed a deal to license her name for pajamas, loungewear, and lingerie; and continued full tilt with her schedule of raucous, fashion-show-as-entertainment presentations.</p><p>This season, the designer configured her show space as a cabaret, setting up tables and chairs and serving drinks to create the right giddy mood. The clothes showed her usual mix of influences: a little bubblegum, a little bondage, a little punk, and a lot of ruffles. There were baby-doll dresses, skinny jeans and cropped tops, tiny T-shirts, minis and slip dresses. But even by Johnson’s cheeky standards, items like a little nightie that said “Fluffer,” and T-shirts printed with the slogan “Guys love B.J.” ratcheted up the raunch factor just a little too high.</p></div>"
16,spring,2004,s2004,bill-blass,"There’s been more than the usual amount of drama at the House of Blass this year. In February, one day after they’d shown the Spring line, house creative director Lars Nilsson and his design partner Herve Pierre Braillard were fired. Two weeks later, Blass management appointed Michael Vollbracht, an illustrator and sometime designer—and perhaps more importantly, a close friend of the late designer’s—as the new name behind the label.</p><p>Vollbracht’s mission is to retain Blass’s fabled, and faithful, customers, while also bringing in the next generation of ladies-in-waiting, and he made his ties to the old days clear by putting some of Blass’s favorite former models, like Pat Cleveland and Diane Dewitt, on the runway. This fall, he’s hitting the road as the house ambassador, with trunk shows lined up in Chicago, Palm Beach, and Houston.</p><p>The spring collection he showed is sure to appeal to the loyalist camps around the country. Blass classics, like cashmere sweaters paired with taffeta skirts, lightweight wool suits in navy or eye-catching pink, and taffeta clutch coats over slim skirts, can’t fail to please, while airy chiffon evening dresses offer just the right amount of flutter for formal events. Some of Vollbracht’s reiterations looked more clunky than classic on the runway, and their appeal to the younger crowd remains to be seen. But as Blass himself said, “timing is everything,” and Vollbracht may just turn out to be right on target.</p></div>"
17,spring,2004,s2004,blaak,"Sachiko Okada and Aaron Sharif of Blaak make casual streetwear out of floppy, worn-in fabric. But what sets the line apart from a humdrum jeans collection is its deceptive simplicity—a lot of thought goes into creating that impression of easy, low-maintenance hipness.</p><p>For spring, Blaak took pre-washed, overdyed cottons and made them into crinkly shirtdresses and circle skirts with crazy animal prints and zigzagging, African-inspired patterns. Okada and Sharif even tackled that most formal of classics, the Chanel-inspired suit, fraying the edges and running zippers up the back of the skirt. (Close up, what looked like lightweight tweed turned out to be hand-perforated cotton, run through the washing machine several dozen times to give it a great, worn-out, messed-up feel.) Another standout was a red-and-white printed anorak, with elastic creating bunchy effects through the torso and sleeves; it turned out to be made of paper. Okada described this season’s look as “Random—borderline mad!” But the collection made perfect sense for seekers of cool, one-off pieces to amp up a summer wardrobe.</p></div>"
18,spring,2004,s2004,boudicca,"Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby knew they had to put on their very best performance to live up to their new standing as the latest great white hopes of London fashion. After winning the support of American Express, the pair, known as Boudicca, is literally following in the footsteps of Alexander McQueen, the last son of the avant-garde to tread the hard road from East End starvation to fashion stardom.</p><p>If the audience expected major McQueen-style theatrics along with the new funding, they were disappointed. Broach and Kirkby don’t want any storyline to distract from their extraordinarily precise, almost molded tailoring, with its geometrically exact inserts, flying pocket flaps, fanny-hugging curves, stiff pleats, and voluptuous, rolling flounces. And while there’s something in the rigor of these clothes that marks them as belonging to the same school of craftsmanship as McQueen, the details—like pleated grosgrain edges and cross-lacing—are pure Boudicca.</p><p>The label’s best feats for Spring were performed in lustrous white heavy-grade couture cotton: sculptural, high-waisted dresses underlined with insets of black; or an intensely curvaceous white skirt suit with the seaming picked out in flat grosgrain ruffles. Sporty, space suit-inspired jackets, some in crunchy metallic silk shot with Lurex, came with zippers diagonally splicing the front. But the highlights were Boudicca’s skirts. Contrived to offer amazing views from the back, they came tightly fitted over the rump in mathematically exact piecings stamped with studs, or with fan-like tail feathers made of stiff pleats, like some strange modern take on a bustle. Close up, all that classy workmanship is a marvel to behold; but viewed with a less technical eye, it also spells S-E-X. That’s a strong step in the right direction along the rocky road to recognition outside London.</p></div>"
19,spring,2004,s2004,burberry-prorsum,"How right it was that Christopher Bailey called in Kate Moss and Stella Tennant—two exemplars of instinctive British style—to show his most accomplished Burberry collection to date. “I just wanted it to look as if it was thrown together,” the designer said. “As if you’d been caught in the rain.”</p><p>Given that the house icon is a mackintosh, it was a stroke of genius for Bailey to build the collection around summer showers; the washed-out pastels and off-whites he worked into crinkled shirtings, gauzes, and leathers looked like they’d benefited from a good soaking of soft English rain. He opened with pinstriped shirting made into trenches, a bag and great skirts that dipped nonchalantly from a hip yoke, interspersed with the prettiest cotton tops and wrap dresses. Breezy shirtdresses and blouses were feminized with scalloped edges and embroidery, but never to the point of cutesiness. Bailey took elements of London’s tomboyish street style—a little skirt, a knit top, and the stringy college scarf he’s made famous—and made an outfit that would pass muster in any chic global capital.</p><p>As for the classic trench, it was cut neat and to the knee in delicious wrinkled putty-colored leather; transformed into a bolero with storm flaps; and reduced to a tiny silky capelet for evening. Splashed-raindrop prints played over coats, jackets, and swimwear as well as on the black-and-white wrap dress that Moss chose as her favorite piece. The classic plaid appeared too, on white-edged clutches and—what else?—a tightly-rolled umbrella. It’s that kind of confidence to play with the signature looks that has this house thriving in an otherwise stormy economy.</p></div>"
20,spring,2004,s2004,calvin-klein-collection,"It was the same runway in the same giant photography studio with the same top models strutting in front of the same audience—all as in seasons past. But for the Spring show at Calvin Klein, there was one very large difference: That wasn’t Calvin taking the bow. Last winter, the designer sold his company to Phillips-Van Heusen, stepped back from day-to-day design duties, and named Francisco Costa, an ex-Gucci designer, head of the women’s collection. Cue lights…</p><p>Given the intimidation factor—Klein observed the show from the sidelines—it’s not surprising that Costa played his debut on the safe side. The collection was very Klein in spirit, hewing to a palette of black, white, and warm brown tones with occasional shots of creamy orange and pink. There were elegantly limp knits in featherweight cashmere, viscose, and silk layered under leather jackets; crisp shirts billowing out over tiny shorts or slim tailored pants; and the kind of interesting details that Klein would have used to raise the occasional eyebrow (a lacy, laser-cut lambskin coat, a bright pink taffeta tunic dress, and clear Lucite pumps with neon-bright straps).</p><p>How much influence Klein still wields in the design room is unclear, but Costa seems determined not to veer too far from the founder’s course. Then again, why mess with fantastic success? When the show closed with Natalia in a fluttery organza-and-tulle dress that was clearly related to fall’s ruffled robes, it was far more homage than farewell.</p></div>"
21,spring,2004,s2004,capucci,"Has quirkiness and nonconformity disappeared entirely from the fashion system? Not when you’re looking at Italy’s multinational Capucci project, for which Bernhard Willhelm (German-born, Antwerp-trained, Paris-dwelling) oversees ready-to-wear, Sybilla (Spanish) designs the once-a-year evening collection, and Franca Maria Carraro (Italian) does the shoes. For spring, Willhelm had fun with the Roman founder’s extraordinary way with volumes. “I was playing with the idea of boxes last season,” he said. “This is sort of a continuation of that, but now I’ve added circles.” Lines of thick, wavy cord stitched onto the hems of short dresses were another, less conceptual borrowing from the archive.</p><p>The cutely eccentric flat shoes and a bright emerald plissé dress, whose ballooning sleeves were suspended from shoulder straps, made for the presentation’s best moments. Willhelm’s personal skew toward the eighties still comes through in an insistence on stripes and leaf-green shades. For curiosity value alone, the Capucci project is a line worth knowing about, but in actual fashion practice, these are strictly clothes for girls who will make their artsy way through the season, avoiding anything so obvious as a trend.</p></div>"
22,spring,2004,s2004,carolina-herrera,"It may have been gray and muggy outside, but inside the Bryant Park tents at Carolina Herrera’s spring show it was all blue skies and lavender-scented Mediterranean breezes. Inspired by the languid, light-soaked Riviera photos taken by Jacques-Henri Lartigue at the turn of the last century, Herrera sent out a dreamy, pretty collection with full-spectrum appeal.</p><p>There’s a new team in the Herrera office, since earlier this year the designer named her daughter Patricia Lansing as designer and Herve Pierre Braillard (ex-Bill Blass and Vera Wang) as design director. Herrera’s trademark elegance is still the guiding force, but there are other influences as well, offering a lighter, sexier feeling with occasional sporty accents. One key piece was the racer-back tank; it opened the show in sheer ivory cashmere, went through a series of embellishments, and ended up black, beaded, and paired with a floaty ivory georgette skirt.</p><p>The palette was limited but not dull: Ivory and black were set off by pale pink, a rosy brick, and shots of lemon yellow, plus a few meandering abstract prints. Fluttery chiffon and slinky jersey dresses were often topped by crocodile link belts or trimmed with wide striped ribbon, while smart, slim day suits got a dash of contrast topstitching. Even without Biarritz on your itinerary, this collection will guarantee you a place in the sun.</p></div>"
23,spring,2004,s2004,celine,"Michael Kors must spend an awful lot of time seeking out inspiration at the beach because, when it comes to designing summer clothes, that's where he always seems to be. For his eponymous line it was Capri; for Celine, it's Tahiti. And very Gauguin it was too, with great hibiscus blooms, pampas grass, and yucca leaves covering everything from skintight jeans to silk shirts, swimsuits, and trailing head scarves.</p><p>Tanned bodies were dripping in gold from the earlobes down: gold purses, gold shoes, you name it. That was the Monte Carlo effect—another muse of a beach for Kors. It's easy to imagine those healthy-wealthy ladies of Monaco decking themselves out in gold-chain prints with lots of matching accessories; perfect for a night in front of the roulette wheel at the casino.</p><p>No one can deny this designer's gift for polish, nor his flair for optimism. As the last fleet of models strutted their stuff in dresses of hot pink, turquoise, black, and white columns suspended from chain-embroidered bodices, one couldn't help but smile. It was a fun trip, but since this is Kors's final collection as the house designer, it's anybody's guess what Celine's next stop will be.</p></div>"
24,spring,2004,s2004,chalayan,"Hussein Chalayan showed off his pretty side for spring. Stripped of stagy effects, his presentation threw no baffling obstacles in the way of his audience, allowing it instead to appreciate the extraordinary complexity and refinement of the clothes. Building from a beginning of casual canvas workwear, Chalayan progressed into florals and then on to an ending of ruched, ruffled dresses with a touch of the fifties, in what seemed to be Hawaiian prints.</p><p>If that reads like a severe case of personality change, don’t be misled. When Chalayan applies his mind to a pair of cotton drill overalls, they end up abstracted and femininized, maybe with a drape of muslin in the bib. His gauzy, faded florals appeared intercut with sporty gray jersey pieces. And when it came to the girly summer-holiday dresses, with their ruffled peplums or stiff frills curling around the neckline, it paid to zoom in on exactly what was going on in that cheery “Hawaiian” print. Mixed up in the pattern is an ancient battle, fought around a modern-day hotel swimming pool, with a plane in the background; Chalayan described it as an exploration of his own ethnic background as a Turkish Cypriot, with the fifties feel alluding to the decade when Cyprus’s political troubles were at their height.</p><p>Still, like everything else in the collection, those dresses carry their symbolism with a youthful lightness. And the fact that Chalayan’s radar has also led him, this season, to explore themes that are preoccupying other designers, only goes to show his ingenuity at its best.</p></div>"
25,spring,2004,s2004,chanel,"“It’s about Chanel, but wearing it played down,” announced Karl Lagerfeld, just before the Spring show. “Sweet, but not too ladylike.” Thus introduced, a parade of neat but never uptight soft little pastel-pink checked tweeds, dainty microprinted georgette dresses, guipure lace skirts, and fresh takes on Coco’s favorite tricot dressing trotted out happily. The inimitable signature jacket came light as a cardigan and delightfully trimmed with tiny raw-edged chiffon ruffles in place of the classic braided edging. To further underscore the superior abilities of Chanel’s workshops, Lagerfeld took the pattern of antique knitted bed covers (a labor-intensive, French-provincial technique called “ouvrage des dames”) and had it reproduced in narrow, scallop-edged cardigan coats which he slipped over short dresses. Even the teensy bikinis were done up in crochet.</p><p>A cute idea popped up amid all this sweetness: the khaki trench, Chanelized by ridges of tweed inset at the seams. That’s no ordinary edging, as Lagerfeld took pains to point out; the tweed was specially woven by the great Parisian couture-craft supplier Lesage. In a world where the word “luxury” has been overused and devalued, Chanel is one house where the standard flies as high as ever. And it is Lagerfeld’s nonchalance with these to-die-for details that imbues the clothes with their essence of confident chic.</p></div>"
26,spring,2004,s2004,chloe,"There was one model in the Chloé show who was a dead ringer for the house’s designer, Phoebe Philo. That may have been an unconscious fluke of casting, but the clothes look like Phoebe, too. Now that she’s moved to Paris, the London girl’s references have acquired a French accent. “I went through my mum’s old fashion magazines—she had a garageful, from when my parents were living in Paris in the late seventies. That’s when I was born,"" she said, ""and I just thought the girls looked so gorgeous, fresh, and happy.”</p><p>So picture a time when French mags showed endless sunny, energetic spreads of models skipping about, laughing in accessible ready-to-wear. When wide-legged bottom-hugging trousers and jeans were cut up to the waist, wedges were in, and cheap-chic fluorescent jelly sandals were paired with short shorts, sporty striped rugby shirts, washed cotton overalls, and sloppy rolled-up work pants.</p><p>Philo recaptured a lot of that feeling quite literally, in what looked like a natural reconfiguring of her knack for sexy designer denim. She also worked in the dressy, Frenchified eyelet and lace that has underpinned the label since the sixties, along with Fiorucci-era jokey banana prints for off-the-shoulder tees and swimsuits. The shoes—which under Philo’s tenure have become a house moneymaker—were a cool composite of Lucite wedge, slivers of silver leather, and macramé toe strap.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vbmq39""></div></div><p>At the end, Phoebe herself made a runway turn for photographers in Chloé jeans and a gauzy blue top—a far cry from her usual brief, cool, self-deprecating, British wave. Perhaps that’s a sign of her growth in confidence, but it also gave Chloé’s worldwide fans their first opportunity to get a good look at the personality who drives the brand. Cute move.</p></div>"
27,spring,2004,s2004,christian-dior,"John Galliano didn’t go on one of his extensive research trips to come up with the Christian Dior concept for spring; perhaps he just popped across Paris to an exhibition of Marlene Dietrich’s clothes that ran this summer. “It was Marlene,” explained the designer. “But then I thought, who would she be today? Marianne Faithfull, Janis Joplin, Courtney Love, Patti Smith!”</p><p>Marlene was clearly behind his opening series of curvy gunmetal satin suits with a forties air; the fox-fur jackets that swanked through the show; and the beautiful bias-cut dresses, in silver or gold lamé tissue, that starred towards the end. In between, Galliano mixed up her influence with tattoo-print body stockings, suits with pieces of corsets and garters dangling from the skirt and jacket hems, and some hip-hop–influenced silk sportswear. There were enough items in the melee to satisfy the faithful: his signature print chiffon dresses, some ultra-sexy swimsuits, and the new twist on the Dior bag (it comes with a fox stole attached to the strap). But anyone looking for Galliano’s next great leap forward will have to wait till next season.</p></div>"
28,spring,2004,s2004,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro channeled the season’s twin themes—frilly vintage dresses and sailor-girl styling—through a séance with Wallis Simpson in her Cap Ferrat incarnation. Mrs. Simpson-gone-kicky wasn’t a bad solution for reminding the audience of what the duo does best: striped cashmeres (the foundation of their business) and the reinterpretations of ladylike dressing, or what they call “clunky couture.”</p><p>The nautical stripes came in red-and-white sweaters and in chevrons of blue and white on neat, knee-length cashmere dresses. These were worn with summery faux-tweedy shorts, jackets, and trenches made out of painted linen, the models tottering on playful printed platforms. References to Simpson’s taste for Elsa Schiaparelli’s surrealist creations and her obsession with Cartier jewels were found in the circus-theme embroideries on burlap jackets, the patterns of hands and birds on silk or chiffon dresses, and the naïve sequin brooches in the shape of dragonflies.</p><p>To their credit, the husband-and-wife team knows how to negotiate fashion history in a way that never looks overearnest. Their offhand way of dealing with prettiness and print—along with some excellent striped beach bags—made their collection a happy, nonchallenging addition to the outlook for summer.</p></div>"
29,spring,2004,s2004,comme-des-garcons,"Technically speaking, there was only one garment in Rei Kawakubo’s collection: a skirt. Apart from the stocking tops used to veil the breasts from complete nudity, and the horned cloth headdresses, she showed nothing else. Not even any shoes. And in fact, with their bunchy forms, exposed ridges of raw seams, and absence of waistbands, they weren’t even really skirts as we know them. Kawakubo said the show was about “designing from shapeless, abstract, intangible forms, not taking into account the body.”</p><p>It was also about testing the concentration of the audience. The wandering imagination tried to seize on the source of Kawakubo’s forms. Were those upholstery covers or curtains she had torn down to sling onto the hips? What was the provenance of those puffy petals of fabric with their occasional pleated underlayers? As an enforced twenty-minute meditation on a single piece of clothing, it was a puzzling experience way beyond the realms of any normal fashion show. Still, there is something in Kawakubo’s out-there abstraction that weirdly parallels the obsession with circular skirts that several designers are currently exploring. Apparently, it’s not really all she's designed for summer, either. At the end of the show, Adrian Joffe, Kawakubo’s husband, was standing by with assurances that there are plenty of jackets in the showroom.</p></div>"
30,spring,2004,s2004,costume-national,"Suede pants laminated to the body. Leather jackets that fit like a glove. Hemlines that leave little, if anything, to the imagination. If this is what turns you on, then Costume National designer Ennio Capasa is your man.</p><p>The collection wasn't all about steam, though. It takes a confident hand to stitch a web of seams into a pair of skintight blush-pink suede pants without making them look either clumsy or banal. And there was plenty of skill evident in skinny hand-brushed leather jackets and cotton macs, with sheer side panels, that emphasized the designer's beloved hourglass silhouette. Or wispy chiffon tops whose butterfly-shaped sleeves fluttered as the models glided by.</p><p>Capasa also served up some surprises with color: Combinations like lemon and powder pink (!), mint and mauve (see the suede accessories), and lilac and pale blue suffused the raunchier pieces with a fresh, upbeat spirit. Which is not to say there wasn't plenty of his trademark noir, spun into curvilinear satin micro dresses, or long evening gowns in—what else?—transparent chiffon. This is fashion that favors the brave.</p></div>"
31,spring,2004,s2004,d-g,"Call it a case of around the world in eighty looks—well, not quite the entire eighty, but when you’ve checked off the matador, the cowgirl, the saloon-bar floozy, the geisha, the boxer, the Scottish lassie, sailor, cheerleader, boxer, surfer, biker chick...you get the picture.</p><p>D&amp;G’s cheerful travelogue, with its playful diversions into uniform, sportswear, and even outer space (one model gamely walked with a spoof Perspex fishbowl on her head), was all about making the sexiest, tightest, and most colorful clothes possible. With its cartoon-ish, pinup flavor, this was most certainly not a collection for fashion intellectuals; but when you’re having this much fun, who cares what the eggheads think?</p></div>"
32,spring,2004,s2004,daryl-k,"In the late 1990’s, Daryl Kerrigan’s famously skinny trousers and cool post-punk vibe made her a downtown darling with real crossover appeal. After a two-year absence from the runway (following business troubles, the closing of her stores, and the birth of her second child), hers was one of the week’s more eagerly anticipated shows.</p><p>Maybe Kerrigan was rusty from all that time off, but her spring collection was a low-spirited affair. She made the layered look—specifically, cut-and-slashed T-shirts and sweats—the core of her show, sending out dozens of variations on the theme of ripped, stitched, and ruched tops, worn alone as minidresses or over those signature slim-cut pants. The palette was resolutely urban, in shades of gray and black with occasional flashes of pink and red. A few tailored pieces, like neat jackets cut from sweatshirt material, a sharp-shouldered black cotton jacket, and black satin vests and parkas showed some of the label’s erstwhile, sexy spark. But overall, the audience was left craving the variety of Kerrigan’s former incarnation.</p></div>"
33,spring,2004,s2004,derek-lam,"Derek Lam said that he designed his sophomore collection “with a <em>woman</em>, not an ingénue, in mind,” and the names he gave his pieces drove the point home. There were “Sophia” and “Ava” dresses, as well as a “Marilyn” camisole that referenced Ms. Monroe, one of Lam’s main inspirations for the season (the other being the film <em>In the Mood for Love</em>). But for all their grown-up sophistication, the clothes were more gamine than sexpot.</p><p>The well edited eighteen-piece show featured a carnation print in slipper satin, a linen brocade shot with silver thread, and a vivid palette, worked into pieces like a cerise paper taffeta shell coat and a turquoise silk/cotton faille trench. Satin bra tops paired with Jacquard skirts were worn with heels for real sizzle; if put together with flats it would make for a flirty look. Pretty daytime options like box-pleat skirts and boyfriend sweaters gave way to the understated glamour of strapless evening dresses. Produced in Italy, Lam’s collection looks and feels expensive—and totally worth it.</p></div>"
34,spring,2004,s2004,diane-von-furstenberg,"Until <em>Sex and the City</em> picks up for its final season in January 2004, those pining for a glimpse of urban glamazons can satisfy their needs by combing through Diane von Furstenberg’s spring collection. Who knows better how to dress the Samanthas and Carries of the world but von Furstenberg, whose savvy at combining sex appeal with serious flair has made her a commercial force to be reckoned with (she’s just added cosmetics to the DVF empire). As usual, her show pulled in an A-list crowd that featured Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Lauren Bush, and T-Boz, along with regulars like Bianca Jagger, Marisa Berenson, and Anh Duong.</p><p>This season, von Furstenberg and creative director Nathan Jenden were inspired by the original <em>Sex</em> symbol, the twenties flapper. They jazzed her up for the present day, though, cutting floaty chiffon dresses close to the body, cropping a tennis skirt into a mini (and producing it in perforated leather), and dip-dying a pair of white sailor’s trousers in rainbow colors. The designer is known for her love of bold prints, and she sent out a baker’s dozen, from abstract shapes to an Egyptian-inspired ibis motif. Of course, dressing for nightlife has been a top priority for the fashionably inclined of every era, so von Furstenberg provided a parade of gowns in body-hugging chiffons and slinky jerseys; perfect for letting the good times roll.</p></div>"
35,spring,2004,s2004,dkny,"Road trip! For her spring collection, Donna Karan sent the DKNY woman on a little cross-country jaunt from her New York home all the way to Malibu, armed with a suitcase full of easy, versatile, sexy looks to get her there and back again in style.</p><p>Ms. DKNY has a practical bent, so she packs light: neutral tones of khaki, gray, and navy, in easy fabrics like washed silk and cotton, jersey, and lightweight wool. Since traveling beyond the 212 area code counts as exotic in her book, she might grab a safari jacket or perhaps the loose silk trench that doubles as a dress. A few pairs of soft, low-slung pants, a slim skirt worn with a tiny yellow chiffon hoodie, or a snug silk tank (cinched with the thinnest snakeskin belt) will take her at least as far as the first rest stop.</p><p>For exploring the nightlife options across America, our heroine will throw in a couple of colorful little silk dresses, or shock the natives in a hot-hued chiffon dress or poncho—which, conveniently, becomes a beach cover-up when she finally stops to admire the sunset over the Pacific.</p></div>"
36,spring,2004,s2004,dolce-gabbana,"Let's start with the ending, since it was so great: a stage full of sparkly, colorful, drop-dead Hollywood gowns, the likes of which most designers in Italy have neglected to mention this season. Beyoncé Knowles, in the front row of Dolce &amp; Gabbana's Spring show, hyperventilated at the sight of Naomi Campbell swinging around in a mini showgirl number done entirely in spangled strands. ""Oh, I'd like the occasion to wear that!"" she exclaimed afterward.</p><p>The rest of the going was just as good, a lighthearted tiptoe through a myriad of fifties- and sixties-era summertime references. Lilly Pulitzer-meets-Pucciesque period prints (with a bit of pop art thrown in) came jumbled up in a melee of little suits, lace coats, and gorgeous georgette beaded cardigans. But don't expect ladylike from the D&amp;G boys. Their girls can't live without the opportunity to show some leg (preferably smothered in printed tights), and when they get into those curvy, lacy dresses, it's safe to assume their flowery underwear will find a way to flash out somehow.</p><p>Still, this is a lightened-up collection in one sense. Gone were the aggressive, punkish, oversexed elements Dolce &amp; Gabbana often throws into a show. (Even the signature black corsetry has been retired for the summer, turning up only as a token in crystal bands on pink.) They weren't missed. What's left is a slew of delicious separates that fit perfectly into the realm of pretty individualism everyone will be aiming for next summer.</p></div>"
37,spring,2004,s2004,donna-karan,"Donna Karan’s designs have always been aimed at the independent woman who negotiates her way through the jungle of contemporary urban life. In Karan’s terrific Spring collection, the designer took that idea literally, showing a range of great clothes that could have come from the closet of a sexy Amazon.</p><p>Windblown, and gleaming with iridescent bronzer, the models stalked on the runway in gorgeous nutty brown leathers that were cut in variations on the bomber/motorcycle style; worn over coppery silk jersey pieces; and stitched into leather “belts” big enough to double as miniskirts (on the models, anyway). Karan used silk jersey, one of her favorite fabrics, in everything from asymmetrical fitted dresses to a charming ruched retro “swim dress” (which returned later, paired with a long skirt, for evening), all in desert tones of peachy terra cotta, bone, and papery pale green.</p><p>Karan is nothing if not versatile. After the savage chic of her opening looks, she switched effortlessly to cityfied sophistication: fitted jackets in crinkly viscose, tobacco-colored silk tweed made into a suit and a slim coat, and a lovely ivory blouse with a deep ruffled collar, all accented with artisanal but feminine details like little drawstring pockets, pintucking, and frayed grosgrain ribbon. She closed with a series of ethereal dresses and gowns, some scattered with oxidized sequins, others woven from bands of fluttering shredded chiffon. Vibrant, sensuous, and wearable, it made for a celebratory closing chapter to Fashion Week.</p></div>"
38,spring,2004,s2004,dries-van-noten,"With glitter on the floorboards, dry ice in the air, and trees bursting through the great arched windows, Dries Van Noten transformed the nineteenth-century study hall of the École des Beaux-Arts into a magical hothouse and filled it with an artist’s vision.</p><p>First he sent out a series of angels in simple white cotton long smocks, waistcoats, and wide trousers. Then he shifted up a gear, with dresses that spilled ruffles and pleats galore. Next came the taupe, interspersed with beat-up silver jackets and trenchcoats. As the color seeped down the runway—from the palest lime to anthracite, putty, and every blue under the sun—so too did the fabrics. Gauzy layers, swishing silks, and sturdy linens were soon oozing decoration. Exquisite embroideries trickled down sleeves or burst over the backs of shrunken jackets. Prints became bolder, in purple, emerald, and lime, blossoming over circle skirts and fragile slipdresses. Even the accessories looked inviting: Lush silk opera capelets were slung over shoulders—the spring alternative to the fur tippet? Silver satchels curved around the hip or the derrière.</p><p>When, at the end, Van Noten’s model army surged toward the cameras, all thirty-five outfits appeared to have been dipped in ink: a complete spectrum of blue-blacks. It has become the designer’s trademark to use his genius sense of color in this way, much to the delight of his faithful clientele.</p></div>"
39,spring,2004,s2004,dsquared,"Fifties-era American bad-girl teen-kitsch at the diner: that was where Dean and Dan Caten headed for spring with their Dsquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; collection. Three of their pinup heroines, all ratted bouffants, stilettos, and eyeliner, set the show’s mood by roaring onto the set—furnished with classic cars and a gang of Dean and Brando look-alikes—on the backs of a trio of Harleys.</p><p>The Catens’ Killer Kittens were a roll call of trashy minxes, from biker chicks in babydoll leathers to Playboy Bunnies in overflowing corsetry to tiara-wearing beauty queens. Underpinning the collection was a commitment to cropping: cropped pants and jeans, slung low and cut provocatively in the back; cropped jackets; and cropped skirts and shorts snipped way, way up.</p><p>Judging by the vast crowd that surged into the hangar-like space on Milan’s outskirts to bear witness to the Dsquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; show, the Caten twins are the latest, greatest designers to hit the Italian scene. Sure, this collection didn’t add anything to what has been said for years by the Versaces, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli; but then again, there’s no denying the buzz.</p></div>"
40,spring,2004,s2004,emanuel-ungaro,"Get on the gold aviators—it's sizzling out there. Giambattisa Valli has taken Ungaro to some steamy equatorial zone where all a certain girl needs in the way of clothes is a wardrobe of swimsuits and scarves to knot about her hot little bod in various ingeniously-revealing ways. Valli explored that idea by turning every poolside appearance into a dressy occasion. Using hot pink, orange, jade, and absinthe jersey and a cache of exotic printed georgette, he set to with the wrapping, draping, and the trailing ruffles.</p><p>In Valli's hands, a swimsuit can come with an attachment of a peony-printed chiffon scarf for winding across the body in a fetching way. Others had thick ropes of plaited jersey circling the neck and running between the breasts to anchor strips of clinging fabric. Even the jackets, with their cutaway fronts and slashed lapels, were tethered with crisscrossing scarves.</p><p>For evening, Latina ruffles, squiggly rose prints, smatterings of sparkle, and crystal strands continued the theme of dressing in as little as possible but for maximum impact. All the slashing, wrapping, draping, and floating asymmetries may end up melting the distinctions between sundress, bathing suit, and evening gown—but in a heated Ungaro climate, why stand on ceremony?</p></div>"
41,spring,2004,s2004,emilio-pucci,"Christian Lacroix, genius colorist and lover of all things patterned, is the designer in charge of raiding the Pucci archives in order to make the company’s style relevant today. For Spring 2004, Lacroix took purple, absinthe, lime, orange, and turquoise prints and shook them up in his fashion kaleidoscope to make little chiffon or satin dresses with asymmetric trails, funny combat-cum-harem trousers, Zouave pants, and scarf-like half-pant, half-skirt notions for tying on over swimsuits.</p><p>More than any other, Pucci is a label that comes into its own in high summer, and some of Lacroix’s swimwear was stellar—one stunning, yachtworthy number plunged from the shoulders to be gathered at the navel in a sunburst of color. There were plenty of delightful midsummer-night party dresses, and the multicolored Pucci dolly bags in soft silk were irresistible. But the collection didn’t quite hit all the high-glam spots it could have—especially in a nostalgically inclined season like this one that’s crazy for romantic prints. Lacroix could have happily edited out all the black, and a closer look at Pucci’s fifties and sixties heritage might have yielded yet more gems that were ready for a twenty-first–century revival.</p></div>"
42,spring,2004,s2004,emma-cook,"Emma Cook, a young London designer, likes to do a lot of research for her seasonal theses; but as she progresses from a sophomore to a junior she’s learning not to lay her themes on too thick. She described her Spring 2004 presentation as inspired by “old-fashioned ideas about futurism, Rodchenko, the constructivists, and 1920’s statues of ladies.”</p><p>What it meant was that Cook had worked machine-age cog motifs and photoprints of butterflies and flowers into flat cutouts that formed straps on dresses, neckpieces, and belts. Other details, like geometric, Deco-inspired leather inserts, also picked up on the Jazz-Age references that are currently preoccupying twenty-something designers the world over. Cook was aiming for a harder edge than usual, via slick black chintz coatdresses and some ultra-cropped boleros, but these served chiefly as garnish for the things she’s happiest doodling every season: little jersey dresses with a certain nonintellectual innocence about them.</p></div>"
43,spring,2004,s2004,emporio-armani,"The Emporio Armani Spring collection is essentially a briefer, perkier version of what Giorgio Armani showed for his main label. Armani’s design team (whom he now sends out to acknowledge the applause before taking his own bow) reworked the season’s nautical theme and came up with an alternative take on summery stripes, using fine-gauge knits to make flippy sweater dresses and cardigans in red, black, and white.</p><p>Those younger, go-faster stripes also appeared on the models’ swim-cap headgear, making an abstract link to the tight, stretchy dresses that were almost brief and clingy enough to compete with bathing suits. The athletic streak surfaced too in zippy, scuba-inspired bustiers and prettified racing shorts made of high-tech synthetics. It came as something of a surprise when the collection switched to a fluorescent palette, with bright multicolored bikinis followed by lime and pink dresses decorated with sixties-style plastic paillettes. But the show ended back on track with a simple, slick-to-the-body black beaded sheath dress—a much simpler option for speedy girls on the go.</p></div>"
44,spring,2004,s2004,fendi,"Forget last year’s fierce, sci-fi/medieval maidens; they’re history. Now that fashion has turned 180 degrees away from winter’s aggressive, angst-ridden armor, the ever-quixotic Karl Lagerfeld has gone back to the drawing board to sketch an alternative version to summer’s main theme of softness and femininity.</p><p>The collection was informed by the idea of circle-cutting, which showed up in the construction of jackets with flounces emphasizing the shoulder line; in petal-shaped skirts; and in cummerbunds. Lagerfeld traced out that soft geometry with contrasting piping, making clothes with an experimental feel that somehow also evoked the work of Bill Gibb and Jean Muir in 1970’s London.</p><p>Focus at Fendi is always on showcasing the company’s state-of-the-art developments in treating fur and skins. The latest how-did-they-do-that technology has produced an extraordinary transparent leather and a perforated ultra-fine suede, both of which trick the eye by narrowing the distinctions between fabric and animal by-product. It wasn’t all about science, however. Lagerfeld wrapped up the show with some cloudy, watercolor chiffons that floated on the general breeze of the summer trend.</p></div>"
45,spring,2004,s2004,frostfrench,"Scattered around the room during the party that preceded the FrostFrench show were Kate Moss and Jefferson Hack, Sam Taylor-Wood, Dan Macmillan, sundry It girls, lots of babies on knees, and some cool grannies (Kate’s mom among them). On the white tablecloths, sugar-iced cakes sat side by side with killer cocktails—a juxtaposition of the sweet with the wicked that typifies the taste of the FrostFrench London girl in more ways than one.</p><p>Sadie Frost and Jemima French opened the proceedings by sending out Jacquetta Wheeler in a cherry-sprigged white swimsuit—all fifties innocence—with a pink rubber Mackintosh shrugged on top. That knack for meshing the pretty with the perverse is what they’re all about: less a complex design process than the act of whipping up some fun with what happens to be in the wardrobe. “I don’t have the time to think out what I wear every morning,” said Sadie Frost. “But I always like that mix of feminine and tough, things you can pull on day or night.”</p><p>On the ingénue side, the girls offered forties-inspired sweetheart puff-sleeved print dresses, balloon-sleeved chiffon blouses in Ossie Clark–like seventies swirls, and outsize wooden-handled purses in the shape of granny’s knitting bags. Watch how they sex it up, though: adding perverse black inflatable arm-bands to an evening outfit of a sheer black camisole and silk knickers; or imagining how a lace-trimmed satin romper would do for daywear when pulled over a striped Lurex sweater. Throwing in some grounding pieces of rumpled cotton khaki—the odd jacket or cropped pant—did no harm, either, steering the show away from theatrics and making it simply a practical inventory of useful stuff. “We don’t want to be overshadowed by gimmicks,” said Jemima French. “We’ve moved on. We want the clothes to speak for themselves.” Even the much-publicized breakup of Frost’s marriage to Jude Law hadn’t disrupted their focus. “Sometimes,” said Frost in the face of a barrage of TV reporters’ questions, “You just have to get stronger and face situations.”</p></div>"
46,spring,2004,s2004,gianfranco-ferre,"There is something about the grandeur of conceit involved in a Gianfranco Ferré presentation; it belongs to an order long gone from fashion. Ferré will take a theme, often inspired by travel or art, and systematically work into it, color by color, pattern by pattern, showing every ingenious angle on the subject in exhaustive sequence.</p><p>For summer, his influences were a meld of the graphic works of Italian secessionist artist Vittorio Zecchin and a vague impression of South America. The associative link between the two is, apparently, a graphic pattern of circles, which Ferré treated in a multiplicity of laser-cuts on everything from organza to leather, and used to make abstract references to Latino costume. Not that Ferré's females are remotely related to the au naturel peasant; stiletto-heeled Amazon is more his style.</p><p>Ferré's woman is at her most impressive in his simplest offerings. The lean gray or pale-blue silk pantsuits with which he opened his show are masterfully cut, and with a big-collared shirt (another genre he has perfected over a lifetime) look absolutely pertinent. From there on, though, the experience of watching Ferré's thoughts about the many possibilities of laser-cutting is like taking a trip to a parallel dimension. Occasionally an item like a cardigan smothered in mother of pearl and edged with dark bands of caviar beading will pique genuine desire. But otherwise, what with the costumes and the prolix arias on various sentiments, a Ferré show has become more akin to a long night at the opera than fashion.</p></div>"
47,spring,2004,s2004,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio is forecasting an easy summer. Catching on to the light breeze of the twenties that’s blowing through fashion, he charted a course for the season using playful, nautical stripes as landmarks, guided by his career-long true north—the play of masculine and feminine styling.</p><p>Of course, Armani isn’t one to take a sailor theme literally, even when he’s using navy-and-white stripes. His distinctive hand shows in his taste for floppy, supple fabrics; and his small jackets and delicate layerings of sheer and opaque project the effortless, cheerful vibe that’s becoming a main message of the season.</p><p>In his lightened-up mood Armani has come to terms with showing some skin, as with slouchy, midriff-baring pants and leggy little dresses (the standouts came with sequined stripes). And was that a sense of whimsy peeking through in the embellishments—the Schiaparelliesque starfish, crabs, and lobsters sprinkled on tanks and bags? The collection navigated that touch of surrealist humor, too, without sailing off course.</p></div>"
48,spring,2004,s2004,givenchy,"With the Carpenters in the air, it was clear before a model set foot on the rustic flagstone runway that this was not going to be one of the disco glitzfests Julien Macdonald habitually throws for his own label in London. Sure enough, the first girl out was wearing a drifty, seventies-era tiered cream cheesecloth tent banded with inserts of macramé and tasseled shoulder straps, followed by a dusty-pink crinkled petticoat dress pulled in with crisscrossed lacing under the bust.</p><p>Macdonald tightened up his romantic hippy theme with a section of shrunken washed cotton bellhop jackets and biker leathers sweetened in tan leather and cream canvas, sometimes layered atop long blouses and cropped pants. Other modernizing touches, among all the airy gauze and ombré-dyed silk, were the eye-catching Givenchy bags—outsized shoulder-slung satchels loaded with heavy-duty straps and chunky leather braids, or giant wooden-handled semi-circular bags in squashy skins.</p><p>It made for a pretty summer collection that showcased some of Macdonald's talent with knit (loosely crocheted fishing-net cardigans, for example) and included the sort of luxury details French women like when summering around the Mediterranean. The season-to-season continuity of brand image remains a point of confusion, though, as this collection seems poles apart from the strictly constructed homages to Audrey Hepburn that Macdonald has been producing for Givenchy Haute Couture.</p></div>"
49,spring,2004,s2004,gucci,"Who is the Gucci girl this season? “She’s eye candy!”Tom Ford laughed backstage. Of course she is. Glamour and provocation are at the core of the sex machine Ford has built at Gucci and, in a time when the pleasure principle is driving fashion, he knows how to push all the right buttons. He kicked things off with a little contradiction: silky track pants with a sporty ribbon running down the side and sloppy, semi-sheer tees, put together with exquisitely classy jackets and high gold sandals. Call it casual/couture, revved up with a flash of gotta-have-it trash in the all-important accessory department.</p><p>Over the last few seasons, as Ford has immersed himself in the culture of couture at Saint Laurent, his focus on cut and detail has become intense. That heightened awareness showed up in the delicious Gucci spring jacket—a feminine, body-hugging number with tiny, pleated fans forming a peplum in back—and in the minute waffles of tucks and pleats inserted into nude satins, which turned up in pants, jackets, and dresses.</p><p>But back to the eye-candy issue. For after dark, Ford produced a parade of red-carpet cuties, snuggled in feathery swan’s-down boleros (in pristine white, egg-yolk yellow, or fuchsia) over curvily constructed knee-length chiffons. For the less sweet-toothed, he sent out the glitter snakes—serpentine crystal motifs wound around the torso or up the arms of black dresses. That's all strictly for high-flying candies, of course. For the rest of us, there are always the bags: madly excessive constructions involving purple, green, and bronze metallic snakes writhing decadently over signature GGs—more temptation than any girl can stand.</p></div>"
50,spring,2004,s2004,haider-ackermann,"The season is shaping up to be a pretty one, full of floaty dresses, fizzy prints, and eye-popping color. But trust a Belgian—or, in this case, a Belgian-trained, Colombian-born Frenchman—to deliver a more austere approach to spring/summer.</p><p>Despite the stark palette of petrol blue, graphite, black, and white, Haider Ackermann’s collection was both light and desirable. His inspiration? ""The street,"" he said simply. ""And elegance."" For the former, read sporty perforated synthetics cut into skinny racer-back vests and harem pants. And for the latter? That would be any one of his dresses—an effortless, elongated blue sweater, say, or a sinuous gray jersey wrap-over style.</p><p>Although Ackermann did veer down a few mean streets with his trickier pieces—softly strapped bondage trousers, tough black leather shorts, and a number of raw-hemmed pencil skirts—he never hit a dead end in a collection that was cool and surprisingly graceful, albeit with a dark soul.</p></div>"
51,spring,2004,s2004,hamish-morrow,"Hamish Morrow gets fired up by the beauty of industrial processes, by the fashion possibilities of non-fashion materials, and by the kaleidoscopic wonders that flash across our computer screens. His Spring collection was inspired by hi-tech yachting tackle, and featured a piece of digital performance art by the team of Warren du Preez and Nick Thornton Jones.</p><p>What sets Morrow apart is his ability to translate all that up-to-the-minute experimentalism into sensuous, wearable clothing that respects couture values. The yachting hardware, like chunky ropes threaded through huge steel eyelets, literally anchored a collection that was otherwise light as a breeze—in both form and fabric. Sport jackets made out of transparent gold nylon cellophane fluttered like tissue. Electroplated nylon was cut into iridescent tailored jackets, in indescribably subtle shades of metallic chartreuse or peach, light enough to crumple into the palm of a hand. Other jackets came with solid fronts, and backs made of sheer sports-style mesh ruched onto a strip of patterned material that followed the spine.</p><p>The whole collection, with its delicate colors, metallic effects, and rigorous geometry, turned out to have been made without a single stitch: Everything was pieced together via ultrasonic welding. That, of course, is a feat in itself, but here’s the best thing: For all its amazing modernity, the show never tipped over into one of those all-too-painful exercises in intellectual avant-gardism. Morrow is one fashion boffin who also loves to dress women.</p></div>"
52,spring,2004,s2004,helmut-lang,"Helmut Lang based his collection on dragonflies. What set him off, he said before the show, was “the lightness of structure, the iridescent color.” Whatever his references, they always become meshed into the recognizable House of Lang signatures: pared-away structures; straps; bits and pieces of T-shirts; and tailoring. That was all apparent in an opening section of layered beige and white, with delicate bandages loosely wrapping pants, and holey T-shirts under a few of his slim suits.</p><p>Last season’s shadow of militaristic strictness and aggression has lifted. In place of the darkness, there are complex but abbreviated shapes and a concentration on working with color—brick red, beige, purple, and green, with sudden flashes of reflective materials and slithery, synthetic translucencies. Some of Lang’s abstracted forms have become far removed from any recognizable function. Odd hip-slung devices came with metallic protrusions on one side, tied on with jersey wraps. Other garments looked like upside-down sweaters, dangling in place of skirts.</p><p>His best silhouettes were tiny, formfitting knit dresses with a contrasting underlayer of sheer, shiny fabric that escaped in miniscule gathered flips. In the end, though, for all the lightness and sensitivity of color in this collection, Lang’s imagination has drifted into obsessing over aesthetic details. In the old days, grown women used to cry over how his pants, tanks, jackets, and coats offered such coolly simple solutions for everyday dressing. Now, for all the vision of beauty he presents, there’s a sense that they’re left on the sidelines, pining.</p></div>"
53,spring,2004,s2004,imitation-of-christ,"""I've been watching a lot of old movies,"" said Tara Subkoff after her spring show, a love letter to the glamour and supposed innocence of black-and-white cinema.</p><p>The production was preceded by a tap routine with a Shirley Temple look-alike, who danced to a recording of Miss Temple's <em>You Gotta Eat Your Spinach, Baby</em>; paused for an interlude during which two ballroom dancers performed to Fred Astaire's rendition of <em>Puttin' on the Ritz</em>; and finally closed out with a kiss between models.</p><p>And so to the clothes, which were shown in a series of vignettes, beginning with black-and-white pieces and eventually incorporating some pastel colors. The first half of the presentation featured looks designed, rather than reclaimed, by Subkoff, and included printed T-shirt dresses, mini-togas, and twenties-inspired tennis outfits, mostly in knit fabrics—all in all, a successful sequel to the all-gray collection she launched last season. The second half was authentic vintage, with that signature Imitation of Christ twist. With Marlene Dietrich on the big screen behind them, the models, accompanied by tuxedoed swells, frolicked in satiny dresses, many with lingerie details, some with beading, and some with a Grecian/goddess feel. The result? Full-on glamour inspired by old Hollywood, but motivated by the new—specifically, said the Los Angeles-based Subkoff, by ""sweet, good, beautiful"" girls like Renée Zellweger and Scarlett Johansson, who have opportunities galore for steppin' out in style.</p></div>"
54,spring,2004,s2004,jean-paul-gaultier,"For spring, Jean Paul Gaultier reprised a few of his favorite obsessions—themes he's been toying with since the eighties when he was first dubbed an <em>enfant terrible</em>.</p><p>His chief fixation, of course, is the corset. Incredible, really, the mileage he's gotten out of a single garment. More remarkable still is that it continues to thrill and inspire him. But this time around, the effect was more sculptural than Madonna-sexy, with jackets that sucked in the waist and skirts that clutched the behind, all lashed with intricate lacing. It was great to see this masterful couturier use his infinite skills in the ready-to-wear line—although at times, the very structure of these exquisitely crafted pieces seemed a little out of step with a season bent on floaty sweet nothings.</p><p>Gaultier got around that conundrum with his saloon girls who sported frothy chiffon dresses beneath their corset casings, or long, languid aprons with their flashy-colored cowgirl boots. There were a few punks too, sans corsets, seemingly tattooed with his trademark body stockings worn beneath wafting parkas. And, as ever, the designer issued his masculine/feminine tailoring. Nobody does an ivory pinstriped suit, or a corset, for that matter, quite like Gaultier.</p></div>"
55,spring,2004,s2004,jens-laugesen,"Sure, the current mood may have turned to optimism and femininity—but who’s going to dress all the tomboys out there who will never feel pretty in pink? Hopes were high for Jens Laugesen, a Danish-born designer educated in Paris and at Central Saint Martins. The impressively organized Laugesen has already delivered two on-the-money collections full of pieces that fit nicely into the military/utility tendency.</p><p>Sad to say, those who turned up eager to witness a new fashion visionary—or even find a sharp new angle on a well-established subcult—went away nonplussed, if not exasperated. Laugesen works in cut-up, monochromatic T-shirts, sweats, knits, and deconstructed tailoring. But his first look, a loose jacket over leggings in layers of cream and gray and festooned with hanging straps, carried a distinct air of déjà vu. As he progressed into canvas leggings heavily cross-laced at the back, the comparisons with collections shown last season—most obviously, the work of Helmut Lang—were painfully unavoidable.</p><p>There may have been some oversized knits and overgrown vests that stood out among the layers, but however well Laugesen is capable of executing individual pieces, he can’t escape the expectations that face every young designer who ventures onto the runway. Next season, Laugesen should work out what he has to say and articulate it in a voice that is his alone.</p></div>"
56,spring,2004,s2004,jil-sander,"Tensions ran high during a lengthy preshow wait for Jil Sander’s highly-anticipated return to the runway. What would this former exemplar of nineties minimalism have to say to a world so drastically altered from the one she left three years ago? Would her reputation for rigor and abstract inventiveness still stand up? From her opening look—a delicate white cotton full-skirted dress with a tracery of sepia flowers printed on the bodice—it was obvious Sander has changed, but without losing herself.</p><p>Her many faithful followers were always attracted to the fact that Sander designed clothes for an intelligent female sensibility, creating a practical laundry list of those most-difficult-to-find simplicities: a great white shirt, wonderful sweaters, a well-cut pantsuit. Coming back with a collection that emphasizes delicacy and femininity isn’t necessarily a contradiction of all that. “I feel I’ve grown up since I’ve been away,” she said, “and at the same time, I’ve become really interested in the joyful idea of being a woman. Stepping out for a little to watch the world has made me feel lighter.” That means good-bye to too much overwrought seriousness; Sander, like many of her working constituents, is conscious of the need to strike an emotional balance in life. But that hasn’t shaken her belief in the integrity of the white shirt, or the perfectly-flattering V-neck sweater. It just means that what she puts with them now might be a crinkly semi-sheer silk skirt, or a refined version of a flounced petticoat.</p><p>Sander’s legendary insistence on using experimental fabrics and techniques is still very much apparent in her use of print, which turned up here as paint-rollered effects on dresses, some with their seams inverted and pressed flat. Her refined taste was present too in the colors she chose: cloudy gray, watery lemon, pale sage, and matte gold amid the predominant white. Miuccia Prada and her husband, Prada head Patrizio Bertelli watched from backstage; afterward, Bertelli, who owns Sander’s company, said, “It was a very positive, serene collection. It’s wonderful to welcome her back to the family.” A sentiment likely to be shared by Sander’s loyal customers everywhere.</p></div>"
57,spring,2004,s2004,jill-stuart,"Since half of Jill Stuart’s SoHo shop is dedicated to the designer’s vintage finds, it's no surprise that many intricate details typical of these pieces should find their way into her spring collection. This season Stuart traveled back in time from her fall show, a celebration of sixties style, to the twenties and thirties, with a strong focus on evening wear. Results varied from an overly derivative silver-beaded flapper dress to a scrumptious gown constructed from pink petals that, though vintage-inspired, looked perfect for right now.</p><p>For day Stuart showed smart trenches, cut above the knee, in black and the peachy pink that is becoming a touchstone of the season, as well as tightly pleated minis in black and a red-and-blue floral that bloomed here and there throughout the show. Ribbons, ruching, and lace insets were among the many lingerie details that updated sporty pieces like bra tops, a pink sweatshirt/bed jacket (tied asymmetrically with a blue grosgrain ribbon), and the shrunken blue blazers that Stuart paired with shorts. For those in the swim, there were a variety of Hollywood-glamorous bathing suits with ruching, bows, and back zips that would look as good on the silver screen as they will poolside at the Chateau Marmont.</p></div>"
58,spring,2004,s2004,john-galliano,"Victorian dolls and Brooke Shields in <em>Pretty Baby</em>: Those were the not-so-innocent fancies that caused John Galliano to get into cream puffs and frills for summer. His first model teetered out in a bustled-up romper confection with overblown transparent sleeves, white stockings and suspenders, and a two-foot pompadour. Her girlie cohorts followed, gussied up in itsy eyelet tutus, marabou-trimmed rosebud-print corsetry, fluttery panties, white knee socks, and all manner of coquettish bows, rosettes, and ribbons.</p><p>After the puff sleeves and baby dolls, Galliano sent out some of his more familiar nineteenth-century bordello denizens in fuchsia corsetry and long <em>Moulin Rouge</em> cutaway flounces. Backstage, the designer insisted that his bubbly summer follies are there simply to explore a new proportion. “It's something I had to do to get to the next phase,” he explained, “like the cardboard cutout show I did a few seasons ago.” Meanwhile, Galliano analysts know to search for those tantalizing signs of the delicacies he reserves for commercial release—like a fragile white lace blouse, or a lilac camisole suspended loosely from bow-trimmed ribbons. And as for the teensy colored purses, swinging from grosgrain straps? Immediately, deliciously consumable.</p></div>"
59,spring,2004,s2004,jonathan-saunders,"Scottish-born designer Jonathan Saunders is one of the freshest discoveries on the London scene, having graduated from Central Saint Martins a mere three years ago. For his second collection, he tapped into the current feel for zingy colors and prints, wrapping delightful, intricately engineered patterns around Alaïa-inspired stretch pieces and cutting printed chiffon into deliciously feminine little dresses.</p><p>Saunders referenced M.C. Escher, the Italian thirties futurist Vasselli, and nineties rave culture, mixed them into a vivid palette of clear blues, greens, yellow, orange, and violet, and emerged with a look that could only have been imagined by a child of the digital age. His taut, strapless all-in-ones and tube dresses featured complex geometric patterns, ombré shading, and graphic lines which broke into different configurations as they ran over each zone of the anatomy. Those simple, lithe shapes, partly derived from dancewear, were counterpointed by floaty dresses caught into beautifully pintucked bodices or full skirts gathered onto jersey yokes.</p><p>Saunders’s talents as a colorist and pattern-meister are already being tapped by the major labels; his contribution to Alexander McQueen’s stunning bird-of-paradise prints of last summer have since earned him consultancies at both Pucci and Chloé. But with this young, vibrantly modern collection, he’s on the brink of winning well-deserved recognition in his own right.</p></div>"
60,spring,2004,s2004,julien-macdonald,"Seven days a week, British tabloid papers run multiple pages of local TV stars, popstrels, It girls, lad-mag models, and soap actresses posing on red carpets (and, later, falling out of nightclubs and whatever microscopic garments they might have selected for the occasion). This is celebrity, Brit-style, a realm in which the name of Julien Macdonald figures as large as legends like Versace and Roberto Cavalli.</p><p>His opening look—Naomi Campbell in a white jacket, black cutaway swimsuit, and sky-high leather laced-up boots—has a good chance of being replicated, literally, by British girls in the clubs of Ibiza and Rhodes next summer. His minute spangled cobweb dresses, sprayed-on white pantsuits and multicoloured chiffon beach cover-ups (a fashion tautology if ever there was one) will be in heavy demand from every competitive celeb-bod in Britain. In a way, then, Macdonald is far more famous and influential than any of his indigenous peers who aspire to change the course of fashion.</p><p>Whether his idea of glamour will ever cut it on an international stage is of course, another question—but one that appears to trouble him not a jot. His celebrity status has brought him business, including multiple sponsorships and a new deal with Pretty Polly to translate his signature knits into cobwebby tights. And he’s certainly not suffering from lack of attention. Backstage after his show, surrounded by a posse of adoring models with red-vinyl lips and a mob of TV crews, the designer declared: “It’s all about having a good time.” Macdonald clearly knows his audience.</p></div>"
61,spring,2004,s2004,junya-watanabe,"Bold. Brilliant. For spring/summer, Junya Watanabe took us on a tour of the body, mapping out new territory on the torso, exploring new lines beneath the waist. As might be expected from the Comme des Garçons protégé, models resembled otherworldly creatures—all sporting identical high, sleek, black wigs and alabaster skin, the ideal canvas on which to build his layers of inventiveness.</p><p>He started with a series of sporty, second-skin undergarments—cropped tanks and cycling shorts—beneath tailored jackets cut from whisker-fine polyester. But then Watanabe’s experiment truly began to develop. Layer by layer, piece by piece, the body was eventually camouflaged by squares and diamonds and dots that spiraled in ever more complex confections. There were white dots the circumference of espresso cups dancing across black dresses, and polka dots of all dimensions were sliced and scattered across fluid, paneled skirts. Sheer gray bird’s-eye check jackets clung to the ribs, their intricate seams tracing the bones beneath. (Diagrams should be offered to Watanabe-wearers, as the point of entry to some of these was hard to detect).</p><p>The only respite from the stark black, white, and gray came in a single trapeze-shaped silky dress covered in diamonds of tan, chocolate, and cream. One could only wonder what this collection might have been had the designer indulged us with his kaleidoscopic sense of color. Maybe next season.</p></div>"
62,spring,2004,s2004,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole opened his Spring 2004 fashion show with a short film that celebrated his twenty years in the business. Most of that time Cole was solely (pun intended) a shoe designer, but in recent years he’s been pushing into new categories, like fragrance and fashion.</p><p>For all his tongue-in-cheek advertising, Cole doesn’t fool around when it comes to fashion. His customer wants moderately hip, uncomplicated clothes, which the designer provides by putting a fresh twist on reliable classics. Last season, he was squarely in the mod camp; for Spring, he went over to the preppy side, showing big V-neck sweaters layered over crisp white shorts and worn with slim trousers or Bermuda shorts. Colors were neutral and muted—shades of gray, taupe, khaki, white—with an occasional splash of canary yellow or cobalt blue. Some charmeuse minidresses added a touch of glam, but for the most part it was an appealingly practical collection.</p></div>"
63,spring,2004,s2004,kim-jones,"The whirlwind of London’s designer hype traditionally starts in grungy East End underground clubs, the kind that get going way after dark and where only the young and brave dare venture. This season, Kim Jones was the name being tossed around by the seasonal cyclone. A menswear designer, it was rumored he had something new to say for women.</p><p>New or not, at least he has a fresh reference point: for his first women’s collection, Jones incorporated aspects of nineties youth culture on top of the 1980’s references already in heavy circulation. “Rave festivals—that was when I first started going out,” he said, to explain the striped Peruvian fabrics that were spliced into a fifteen-look collection of cropped jackets, colorful curvy dresses, and ruched leggings that also invoked that other totemic figure of the season, Azzedine Alaïa.</p><p>Although all the women’s pieces will be sold under the Kim Jones label, the collaborative-minded Jones didn’t actually design the collection; that was done, quite openly, by his pal Marios Schwab, a recent Central Saint Martins graduate. Jones, meanwhile, concentrated on menswear ideas like making pants out of patched-together handkerchiefs. The whole endeavor has the authentic air of the amateur start-up that doesn’t quite make sense or play by the rules. Partly annoying, partly intriguing; but then again, definitely on the radar for next season.</p></div>"
64,spring,2004,s2004,krizia,"Curiosity over the lines of succession at well-established houses is becoming one of fashion’s favorite preoccupations. What happens when a designer reaches a point in life where stepping back seems only natural? And how can a label be injected with new energy, without losing its singularity? Mariuccia Mandelli, who is still very much hands-on in her own design room, has called in the London designer Hamish Morrow to work through those questions over the last two seasons at Krizia, and she clearly has confidence in his talent; at the end of her Spring 2004 show, she brought him out in front of the audience to take a joint bow.</p><p>Leafing through the results of their collaboration backstage, Mandelli pointed out the ""sport chic"" elements that made it into the collection. Morrow, who has his own fledgling line back home in London, is a modernist with an interest in technical fabrics, and his hand was evident in details like leather parachute harnesses on dresses and swimwear. His eye for bright, slightly jarring color combinations showed up, too, in tonal placings of shades of green, orange, and yellow. Mandelli also drew attention to the high-tech materials that can only be produced in Italy—modern luxe inventions like steel gauze (made into light, crinkly trenches and jackets) and washable leather, which Morrow used for biker pants. White leather zippered bodices and body-hugging dresses, meanwhile, projected a souped-up sexiness rather than Morrow’s instinctive taste for abstraction. Only time will tell whether this relationship will ensure a sound future direction for the house. But it’s certainly an interesting start.</p></div>"
65,spring,2004,s2004,lagerfeld-gallery,"""Graphic effects!"" exclaimed the designer backstage before he was swamped by well-wishers. Right. And there were plenty of them in his Spring collection, from the waspish silhouettes to the laser-sharp pleated dresses and bold prints.</p><p>Lagerfeld flitted from one theme to the next in his quest for a striking statement. Tough-shouldered jackets and stiff little skirts in croc-stamped leather were swiftly replaced by a fleet of sinuous, slithering sheath dresses—some with Grecian folds, others that clasped at the shoulder with a silver buckle. Next up, a couple of bikini-clad beach babes, whose jersey robes fell to the floor at the pull of a strap. Then came the faded denim: a natty cropped jacket here, a curvy pinafore there. These were hotly pursued by dainty chiffon dresses—in chocolate, black, or coral—given a graphic twist with shoulder straps and waistbands cut from sparkling shagreen.</p><p>Of course, the proceedings wouldn't be complete without the designer's obligatory strict black suits, worn with crisp white shirts, high starched collars, thin black neckties, and super-svelte skirts of both the mini and pencil persuasion. Nor would the show be the same without one of Lagerfeld's witty, self-mocking edicts: T-shirts, as slender as the designer himself, were branded with the message ""4 Slim People."" As if there was any doubt.</p></div>"
66,spring,2004,s2004,lanvin,"For spring, Alber Elbaz abandoned his concern with intricate surfaces and dainty jeweling. Instead, like several other designers in Paris, he went back to the drawing board of couture fundamentals in an effort to pull something modern-looking out of old-school methods. His particular focus for Lanvin was seamless draping, possibly the trickiest of all technical challenges. Elbaz also grasped at the slippery subject of slinky, thirties-era glamour—something that has emerged as a preoccupation of the season. Some of it worked, but not on every level.</p><p>The designer wrapped satin and taffeta around the body, with the edges of the fabric tied in loose, flat bows or emerging as bustles, ripples along spine lines, or asymmetric flicks flying out from the side of a dress. To emphasize the flow, surface detail was limited to two devices for holding everything in place: strategically placed hooks and eyes, and flat metal snaps. Edges were left raw.</p><p>The problem with this apparent simplicity is that it calls more attention to the aesthetic decisions made about color, accessories, and other intangibles of styling. Some of the dresses in silver or bronze sequins, with their twisted plunge necklines, looked effortlessly divine and right in step with the season. Ditto the pieces in lingerie-pale pink, coral, or peacock-blue satin. Yet Elbaz only demonstrated how hard it is to do charmeuse (and charm) when he brought on searing yellow, royal blue, or emerald, and his treatment of flashy gold sequins was equally jarring. What also escaped were crucial incidentals like footwear that can make a collection coalesce (knee-high black spiked boots, for example, clunked). Close up, there were many extraordinary items; but now Elbaz needs to mold and edit his technique to an image that's completely satisfying.</p></div>"
67,spring,2004,s2004,louis-vuitton,"When Marc Jacobs is on form at Louis Vuitton, he can make clothes so effortlessly, eclectically right that it leaves the audience tingling. In a season when old-time movie glamour, an adoration for saturated color, lovely textures, and glints of glitter are the materials of a woman’s fantasies, Jacobs had the last word on making all of those work every day—and every night, for that matter.</p><p>The sensation started the minute the auditorium darkened; music pumped and a projection of an LV monogram covered the entire space including the figure of the first advancing model. She was wearing an absinthe draped silk top with a little silk crepe de chine peacock-blue skirt and a pair of suede platforms, carrying one of the neat new LV monogrammed bags (this season, its chunky straps are picked out in juicy colors or gold). Jacobs worked to bring an antique richness to the clothes by using panne velvet, pressed sequins, and gold and silver lamé, but it never became overdone or literally vintage. The sequins could turn up banded onto a wear-in-the-street glazed linen trenchcoat, the gold lamé made into a cute blouse/jacket too great to save for special occasions. With the inclusion of pieces like Clam diggers and sailor pants for practicality, and items like small decorative dresses, tap pants, and a pale Lurex swimsuit for insane temptation, it was a collection that gelled all the elements of the way a young woman wants to look and feel.</p><p>That is Jacobs’s knack, although at Vuitton he generously reflects accolades back on his hip behind-the-scenes team. “It’s the things we like playing with, our favorite things,” he said afterward. “But it’s always about our favorite things of the moment.” Sometimes the best collections happen when designers don’t torture themselves to make a statement. This season, fashion is essentially about nothing more cerebral than finding a way to feel and look happy—and Marc Jacobs nailed it.</p></div>"
68,spring,2004,s2004,luca-luca,"On the heels of his all-black winter show, Luca Orlandi fervently embraced femininity and Mediterranean-inspired color for spring. His aim, he said, was ""to create the effect of a summer dream,"" and the music—<em>Love to Love You Baby</em> mixed with Vive la Fête and some steamy, heavy-breathing numbers—made it clear exactly what kind of reverie the designer had in mind.</p><p>Orlandi’s lingerie-inspired collection was worn by bed-headed models who heated up the runway in peach-colored silk satin tops, skirts, and jackets that were ruched, strapped, and corset-laced every which way. (The most interesting variation on the theme was a shrunken cap-sleeved, ruched leather jacket worn by Alek Wek.) There was no shortage of South Beach-ready club wear, from skin-baring, open-backed tops and halters paired with flowing silk pants, to the pajama-style jumpsuits which closed the show. Orlandi also nodded to the goddess look, offering long jersey dresses like a one-shouldered piece worn by Oluchi. For those who like it hot (the audience included T-Boz, Seal, Tweet, Ingrid Casares, Garcelle Beauvais, Roberto Cavalli, and Anthony Kiedis) there was plenty to applaud.</p></div>"
69,spring,2004,s2004,luella,"London-based Luella Bartley designed her collection this past summer as Europe was enduring its vicious heat wave and she was coming to the end of her pregnancy. So it’s no surprise that her spring line was full of breezy pieces meant to float off the body while keeping spirits from wilting.</p><p>The title of the collection was “a tribe called Luella,” a group which clearly shares some anthropological traits with the clan of Bananarama: There were outsized overalls worn over tiny tops; loose, lightweight cotton and silk blouses; dresses wrapped with ropy braided belts; and generously cut menswear pieces, like a giant V-neck sweater worn as a mini or a billowing blue cotton shirt with soft drawstring trousers. And though there were some tweeds worked into the mix, they steered clear of serious; Luella’s tiny minis and flaring boleros piped in Day-Glo are in no danger of being mistaken for Chanel (although her increasingly great handbags could start their own cult).</p><p>For decoration, Bartley strung her models in fetishes of all kinds: cheery leather skulls, crossbones, smiley faces, and hearts, as well as a few tiny Net MD Walkmans supplied by her corporate sponsor, Sony. If 2004 brings another cruel, cruel summer, at least the Bartley tribe will be dressed for it.</p></div>"
70,spring,2004,s2004,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"For his secondary line, Marc by Marc Jacobs, the designer habitually—and joyfully—recalls a time and a place most people are glad to forget: the hallways of Public High School U.S.A., circa 1979. Some seasons he re-thinks the clean-cut preppy set, while other times he zeroes in on the social fringe. For Spring 2004 he conjured tough boys and bad girls, the kind who get suspended for smoking and who put together their wardrobes from the army-navy store and the bins at Goodwill.</p><p>To a headbanging soundtrack (with the volume turned up to 11), Jacobs sent a torrent of punked-out girls and guys racing down the runway in his trademark, casually assembled collages. The first look included satin hot pants, layered T-shirts, a big canvas ballet bag, a trailing scarf, and a pair of sparkly combat boots. In contrast to the controlled palette and minimal adornment of his main line, Jacobs let loose here, mixing blue, pink, green, orange, black, and gold in a single outfit, and piling on scarves, bags, silkscreen patterns, embroidery, and lots of tiny pins. Under his masterful direction, it all looked cooler than cool. More importantly, his signature combinations included plenty of great pieces for grownups: slouchy cotton twill trousers, pretty floral dresses, skimpy ribbed T-shirts to wear under an artfully beat-up denim or corduroy jacket. But as fertile an inspiration as high school clearly is, wouldn’t it be nice to see what Marc would look like if it grew up and went to college?</p></div>"
71,spring,2004,s2004,marc-jacobs,"Packed onto metal bleachers, waiting late into the night in a sweltering auditorium, fanning themselves with damp program notes—it would have taken quite a presentation to lift the weary spirits of the audience members at Marc Jacobs. Instead of rousing the crowd with a high-energy sequel to his color-packed, tightly constructed Fall show, however, Jacobs soothed the savage mood with a sweet confection of a collection, full of pretty clothes and gentle colors.</p><p>It didn’t hurt that the first model out was the rarely sighted Gisele (greeted like a returning rock star), or that Beyoncé was on the soundtrack, or that the clothes were easy to like. Jacobs started his design career at Perry Ellis, whose insouciant take on sportswear and relaxed tailoring defined an era, and tonight he scattered references to Ellis throughout. Loose, menswear-tailored linen trousers and rolled-up seersucker shorts were worn with soft ballerina-wrap cashmere sweaters, or striped silk shirts feminized with scraps of ruffle. Deep-blue chenille was knitted wittily into “denim” jackets and coats, sometimes worn with slim cropped tuxedo pants.</p><p>Of course, there was plenty of present-day Jacobs, too. Lovely floral sundresses came in pinks and aquas, panne velvet skirts in muted blues and greens. There were gauzy sheer dresses with pintucking and stacks of rough-edged ruffles, a wonderful gilded trench coat, and a few saucy, sequined minis. And when Gisele closed the night in a swishy pink gown, the roar of applause showed that all was forgiven.</p></div>"
72,spring,2004,s2004,marni,"Consuelo Castiglioni’s early Marni collections sometimes looked like the artlessly lovely results of a girl’s home dressmaking classes, but she has moved on from all those seasons of naïve rosebud cottons, evolving to a point of graceful accomplishment. And while her work has always been distinguished by her affection for vintage-style fabrics and love of color and print, she also knows how to work those feelings in the right seasonal direction. For spring, she conjured a delightfully easy, nonliteral look out of the current obsession with the fifties.</p><p>A salmon pink-striped three-quarter sleeved coat opened the show, worn over a silky skirt in beige with white polka dots. Another coat, this one in lime, came with the polka dots billowing out from a loose lining. The deft color mixes—teal, turquoise, mint, raspberry, biscuit, and silver—looked mouth-watering, as did the prints: amusing versions of scribbly fifties curtain material, made into witty plastic swimsuits and canvas duffel bags.</p><p>The Marni twist—quite literally—came in the curved cutting and piecing techniques Castiglioni used to skew the retro silhouette, producing intriguingly puffy, rounded sleeves and dropped shoulder lines in jackets and coats; sexy, narrow bias-cut striped pants; and subtly rethought T-shirts and knits. But for all the experimentation—which also showed up in the technically enhanced, laundered couture fabrics—this was a collection that made summer dressing look beautiful and effortless.</p></div>"
73,spring,2004,s2004,martin-grant,"""He's just great. His clothes are exquisite,"" raved Lee Radziwill, one of Martin Grant's more high-profile fans, who arrived at the designer's show (held in a cloistered courtyard) wearing one of his tomato suede jackets. It wasn't hard to see why the Australian designer holds such appeal for the likes of Radziwill; his collection was the epitome of chic. And though it might be ready-to-wear, every piece—every stitch, even—showed a zeal for the craft of couture. From the first anthracite satin minitrench to the knife-pleated Lurex skirts worn with backless chiffon halters or narrow crepe jackets with pushed up sleeves, Grant's clothes were impeccable. Yes, they're Park Avenue grand—perfect for those polite ladies who never have a hair or hemline out of place. That's not to say they won't appeal to younger high-maintenance types too. It might be old-school technique, but the effect was dynamic and contemporary, without any need for gimmicks or fuss.</p><p>Backstage, the designer said the collection was inspired by his grandmother, who taught him to sew. ""Her thing was the shirtdress,"" he said. ""She always wore them."" His versions served as the bedrock of his collection, cut narrow, never tight, in long and mini proportions. But graceful glamour ended the show in the form of a strapless gown in wavy chiffon ruffles. If ever a Hollywood star needed some red carpet fashion credibility, she could do well to start here.</p></div>"
74,spring,2004,s2004,martine-sitbon,"""I wanted to take couture elements, like bows and flowers, but do them in a spontaneous, modern, comfortable way,"" explained Martine Sitbon. Hardly the torturously intellectual talk of a respected French modernist, but then this is Paris, Spring 2004, and designers everywhere are lightening up their acts.</p><p>Sitbon was no exception. For a section of clothes made from parachute silk, she raided the colors from the makeup counter—powdery blush, baby blue, a highlight of lime, lipstick magenta. But while the sweatshirts, ruched-sleeved parkas, and ice-skating skirts looked pretty, easy, and undemanding, some of the repetitive dresses did not: Loose cummerbunds bulked up the hips and large silk flowers were plonked on thighs, a little <em>too</em> spontaneously. Will the Sitbon customer really want to wear dresses so sugary sweet they resembled upside-down tulips? Will even her die-hard fans snap up the aprons covered in chiffon blooms?</p><p>Fear not, all you Sitbon lovers. Her alternative—a play on masculine/feminine tailoring—gave the collection balance and rescued it from the saccharine realms of cotton-candy couture. Crisp white frock coats, backless waistcoats, and wide cream trousers looked smart, imaginative, and sexy, as did the last few slithery black satin sheaths with twisted velvet straps—just the sort of strong signature pieces that her customers know and love.</p></div>"
75,spring,2004,s2004,matthew-williamson,"Like planets orbiting the sun, trends are constantly circling the fashion universe, and lucky is the designer who happens to be in the right place when his stars align. Brit favorite Matthew Williamson, who has been doing colorful and sexy his whole career, is perfectly positioned to enjoy the swingy, tropical feeling and lingerie-infused moments that are dominating New York’s runways.</p><p>That’s a good thing, since Williamson, whose first flagship store will open in London next year, would probably rather die than do, say, careerwear or minimalism. His opening outfit summed up his “where’s the party” attitude: a crisp white trapeze coat and a pair of jeans ornamented with tiny pompons on the back pockets. The whites, and some soft gray corduroy, were a foundation for a collection bursting with colors like cobalt blue, pink, and purple, as well as prints (especially a vivid peacock motif) and embroideries. The designer used chiffons, satins, and bold Jacquards to make butterfly-sleeve tops, cowboy shirts, and trim, decorative coats, and gave a few of his models big snakeskin satchels in—what else?—metallic lamé. (The same material showed up in his shoes, Williamson’s first foray into footwear.)</p><p>There were a couple of questionable pieces, like the poorly constructed embroidered dresses that closed the proceedings. But overall, Williamson provided plenty of choices for society girls and celebs (like Mischa Barton of <em>The O.C.</em>, seated front row) to wear out on the town.</p></div>"
76,spring,2004,s2004,max-mara,"One of Italy’s oldest ready-to-wear companies, MaxMara made its name in the fifties, mainly as a purveyor of quality coats, and is still motoring on that business today, selling stylish outerwear and tailoring to women all over the world. The challenge faced by the label each season is how to spin a trend around its solid brand franchise, and build it into something that makes a sustained statement as a runway collection.</p><p>The core idea for spring was easy enough to spot: soft, washed materials like canvas and leather, made into slouchy-pocketed jackets, trenches, and short, puffy bombers; plus a handful of masculine vests, some floaty, Stevie Nicks–type dresses (a few done in Zandra Rhodes–like prints), and a palette of muted, sanded-down, tea-stained colors. The collection included some of the fine-gauge cropped knits that are emerging as a seasonal essential, and touched on the current feeling for stripes and for lightened-up masculine dressing, featured in a pale blue-and-white seersucker three-piece suit with cropped pants. It was less successful in catching on to another key virtue of modern fashion: the art of the edit. Brevity is the soul of any strong statement, and this one was weakened by too much repetition.</p></div>"
77,spring,2004,s2004,michael-kors-collection,"Call it destination dressing. For his spring collection, Michael Kors created a wardrobe with a specific locale in mind: the tiny Mediterranean island of Capri, where pleasure-seekers spend their days yacht-hopping in the harbor and their nights table-hopping at the cafés.</p><p>The designer excels at giving classic cuts a sexy edge and a sly spin of luxe, and this season’s jet-set theme gave him carte blanche to pile it on. He added bright gold zippers and contrast stitching to slim jeans; cut miniskirts and motorcycle jackets out of supple suede; and wrapped a prizefighter-size gold belt around a suede romper. Typical Kors hallmarks included leather luggage straps in place of ties on a halter dress, nautical references, and his signature mix of high and low fabrics (silk and canvas, for example). He used white, black, and khaki as a backdrop to set off colors—like vivid orange, yellow, cobalt, and green—which were far more intense than the muted tones generally in favor this season.</p><p>For a major designer, Kors didn’t offer much in the way of full-out evening glamour, just a few simple gowns and one beaded dress as blue as the Mediterranean. But his color-blocked cashmeres, swingy silk jersey skirts, crisp organdy shirts, and dresses in blue-and-white awning stripes will certainly make his customer feel ready for Capri—even if she’s stuck in midtown.</p></div>"
78,spring,2004,s2004,miguel-adrover,"Miguel Adrover, one-time messiah and part-time pariah of the New York fashion world, returned to the tents with a collection entitled “thesurrealrealworld.” Divided into nine sections, the show opened with a face- and body-painted model who walked down a darkened runway to the sound of cicadas and the artificial lightning of a corps of paparazzi. From there, Adrover took his audience on a continent-hopping jaunt, finally returning to his aesthetic roots: tailored prep-school looks and uniforms, daring feats of drapery, and ingenious trompe l’oeil constructions.</p><p>Some of the show’s kookier experiments included a UPS man’s exit onto the runway (thank you, sponsor), a model whose cape was actually a banner calling for “world peace, please,” and a man who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders (via a Tom Sawyer stick from which hung a cloth globe). Mixed in among these, though, were some moments of genuine euphoria. Adrover used shredded cloth and ribbons of lining tape to make beautiful, African-inspired, plume-like capes and jackets and skirts. There were draped, dress-like jumpsuits; dresses whose back panels tied in front, apron-style; and lots of classic American prep--impeccably tailored suits, coats, and elbow-patched blazers, paired with oxford shirts and khakis and wonderful knits.</p><p>Adrover himself took to the runway in what looked like a top, a vest, and two coats, but was in fact all one piece (there was also a female version). The most memorable exit—perfectly illustrating both the designer’s extreme lyricism and his technical expertise—was a dress that was also a ship: long, hand-painted with masts, and with a white sail/train rigged to the back.</p></div>"
79,spring,2004,s2004,missoni,"With their slinky, striped knits, knotted-string halternecks, frizzed-out hairdos, and wooden platform sandals, the girls at Missoni might have been having a flashback to the 1970's. And why not? That was the decade when Tai and Rosita Missoni first made big news, and this show was an emotional celebration of their multicolored fifty-year run as one of Italy’s most-loved family businesses.</p><p>The Missonis’ daughter, Angela, has carried the company’s obsession with zigzags, chevrons, and stripes to a new high. Her delicately playful pop animal prints, swirly art nouveau–derived patterns, and flaring vertical lines—all controlled by a slim, body-conscious silhouette—make for an amazing spectrum of separates, dresses, and utterly desirable cutout swimsuits and beach cover-ups.</p><p>Angela’s collection was followed by a runway retrospective of her parents’ archives, a parade that illustrated the range of creativity and imagination that propelled Missoni to become a cult label of the rich hippie/jet-set era. It was like watching a knitted footnote to the history of fashion, weaving its way through space age to bohemian eclectic to Studio 54, offering kaleidoscopes of color in tapestries, patchworks, quilts, butterfly wings, and every variation of stripe imaginable. More extraordinary still, most of it looked absolutely wearable now. Perhaps that’s an observation on how all-inclusive trends have become; it also shows just how rich and inspiring an inheritance Angela Missoni has to play with.</p></div>"
80,spring,2004,s2004,miu-miu,"Sometimes the most inspirational fashion doesn’t come as an in-your-face design statement, but as a suggestion—like spotting a girl on the street who really knows how to put herself together. Watching Miu Miu’s collection for spring was just like that: a gentle mix of vintage and new, casual and decorative, anchored with the perfect accessories.</p><p>Miuccia Prada knows, for instance, exactly how to make one of those vibrant pink sixties cocktail shifts—the sort that come encrusted with jewels at the neck—wearable by throwing on a plain sage-green cardigan, pulling it in with a leather belt, and accessorizing with a pair of cute but grounding suede pumps. Voila, easy.</p><p>That kind of eclectic, offhand charm pervaded the entire collection from the little rumpled linen jackets and coats, to the denim shirtdresses and high-waisted pedal pushers, to the fifties dressmaker–style evening frocks. Better still, it was a show of irresistible accessories. In the hair, feathery fifties headbands. On the feet, printed plush-velvet high pumps or flat moccasins. In the hand, soft leather bags with bamboo handles or brilliant orange versions encrusted with beads. It all amounted to an idealized inventory of the lucky finds millions of girls spend their Saturdays seeking out at flea markets. Next season, no need to waste time: It’s all there, ready and waiting at that clever Miuccia’s stall.</p></div>"
81,spring,2004,s2004,moschino,"Schoolgirlish jokes are to Moschino what knits are to Missoni or psychedelic prints to Pucci: the core of its brand identity. This season the goofing around started with a rusty brown coat masquerading as a door—complete with panels, brass knocker, and house number—worn open over a bikini, with fluorescent over-the-knee stockings and satin wedges. From there the collection played a kind of sophomoric peekaboo with surrealism, referencing Dali (lip prints on silk dresses), Elsa Schiaparelli, and Christian Berard (pink georgette scarf-printed gowns).</p><p>For those who still didn’t get it, cotton underwear graffiti’d with slogans like ""too haute to handle"" (bada-boom) signaled to the general theme of messing about with the icons of Parisian couture. Chanel-inspired jackets had fringes clanking with plastic beads in hard-candy colors; fifties–style strapless tulle evening gowns were encrusted with safety pins or enamel badges to mimic embroidery. Some of the gags were misjudged, like a reprise of punk (not <em>that</em> old chestnut again!) and the use of far too much black to be funny. But there were plenty of pieces that toyed with summer’s trends in a way that won’t make Moschino shoppers feel they’re buying into a complete joke.</p></div>"
82,spring,2004,s2004,narciso-rodriguez,"As she watched the parade of models sway down the runway in Narciso Rodriguez’s sexy spring show, Julianna Margulies turned more than once to her front-row neighbor Stephanie Seymour and rolled her eyes in delirious delight. She wasn’t the only one. Inspired by Brazil, and especially the wild abandon of Carnival, Narciso Rodriguez sent out a collection that married his meticulously cool elegance to a steamy new sensuality.</p><p>What’s become his signature look—skintight dresses, molded to every curve—was still the heart of the proceedings. But this season, Rodriguez warmed it up with earthy, textured fabrics like linen, washed silk, and crisp white cotton. He inserted sheer panels of tulle or simply cut out bits of the bodice for a glimpse of skin, and made a lattice of lingerie straps across the back. Slim pants were worn with trapeze jackets or tops whose swingy peplums perfectly emphasized the model’s own curves. True to form, the designer sent out a wealth of lovely evening gowns, made from fluttering parachute silk (a welcome change from the season’s ubiquitous chiffon) in black, violet, rose, white, and nude, gently detailed with pintucks, tulle, or a bit of beading.</p><p>There may not have been any huge departure from the look he’s made so clearly his own, but Rodriguez designs according to his convictions, not the prevailing trends. Combined with his formidable talent, that relentless focus will keep his faithful customers very happy this spring.</p></div>"
83,spring,2004,s2004,nina-ricci,"""Lightness, color, femininity,"" said Lars Nilsson, summing up a sweet debut collection for Nina Ricci that focused on wispy, weightless daywear. But wasn't Nina Ricci the sophisticated tailor of her day? Didn't she dress ladies of a certain age in classic suits? Nilsson, who proved that he could cut a mean jacket and pants during his tenure at Bill Blass, abandoned tailoring altogether for his summer statement, save a single black wool gabardine jacket worn with knitted shorts. ""I was after something more sensual,"" he explained.</p><p>Hence all the super-delicate lingerie slips and bra tops with spider-web lace or tulle inserts that came with Bermuda shorts, flippy skirts, and silk blousons. The colors—lemon, tangerine, almond, mint—were delicious, especially when they sparkled with Lurex thread or were embroidered with transparent beads. And the dresses, from chiffon confections sprinkled with bows to slender jersey tanks, were perfectly in tune with this season's passion for all things pretty.</p><p>The purposeful femininity was no doubt intended to stamp the Nina Ricci brand with a strong, and much needed, sense of identity. But the collection overall was too floaty, and more tailoring might have anchored it better. We’ll just have to wait until fall to see how Mr. Nilsson cuts his trousers.</p></div>"
84,spring,2004,s2004,oscar-de-la-renta,"It’s virtually impossible not to get swept up in Oscar de la Renta’s confident vision of the luxurious life. The designer played to all of his strengths for spring, showing more of the pretty dresses, chic suits, and slim coats that have made him a touchstone of relaxed, modern elegance.</p><p>Judging from the cuts and colors of this collection, de la Renta has Palm Beach on his mind. He opened with a series of brightly colored dresses and skirts, some cut in a swingy, ballooning silhouette, others slim and paired with silk sweaters. The designer knows how to keep things young—by roughing up the edges of a turquoise silk skirt or tossing a boxy yellow alligator jacket over a slim white skirt—as well as how to dress those whose daily routine includes cocktails on the yacht (answer: a group of simple black dresses, each more Hepburn-perfect than the last, or a spangly pink pencil skirt worn with a cashmere top to fend off ocean breezes).</p><p>Turning up the volume for evening, de la Renta progressed from a long, cool pour of pink charmeuse, to a giddy yellow satin strapless dress covered in nosegays of silk flowers, to embroidered and embellished showstoppers guaranteed to make it a memorable night—red carpet or not.</p></div>"
85,spring,2004,s2004,paul-smith,"There’s still a boyish quality to Paul Smith, even though he’s a “Sir” now—not to mention the most financially successful Brit designer ever, and something of a national treasure to boot. Smith’s ability to play games with old English classics—deflating pomposity with color and wit, while never looking like he’s trying too hard—is what’s made him a worldwide hit in menswear, and guess what? That’s exactly how it works best for girls, too.</p><p>In a season when crisp shirts and V-neck sweaters are news again, Smith is in his element, having fun with stripes and ties, and turning school uniform-style fine-gauge knits into skimpy dresses. Cut close to the body, his suits, with their bracelet-length sleeves and their skirts caught up in a ruched detail in the back, are just naughty enough to avoid any teacher’s-pet primness. The designer also worked his blue-and-white shirting stripes into little camisole-top cotton dresses, and made printed silk scarves—that other bastion of ladylike dressing—into bright camisoles and strappy shifts. It added up to a happy, easy-to-shop collection that worked best when Sir Paul seemed to be designing off the cuff.</p></div>"
86,spring,2004,s2004,peter-som,"Peter Som will probably never have an avant-garde moment, and that’s a very good thing. His vision of cheerful, pretty sportswear has been picking up both momentum and fans over the last few seasons, and this latest collection will surely add a few more members to the club.</p><p>For Spring, Som connected fall’s mod mood to the light-and-lacy trend that’s been dominating the runways. Inspired by the wide-eyed optimism (not to mention the daring fashion movements) of the early sixties, he shortened hemlines, cropped sleeves, and raised waistlines, with happy results. Som combined airy, pale blues and pinks with white, gray, and green, and mixed up textures—chiffon, lace, satin, washed cotton, and a glittery blue-and-silver cloqué—to keep things interesting. Trailing satin ribbons and squashed silk flowers upped the femininity quotient even further.</p><p>The past may have provided the inspiration, but Som’s mind is very much on the present; his trim canvas jackets, slim cropped trousers, and skin-baring minis are clearly aimed at the toned twenty-first-century girl. Fortunately, this designer knows where to draw the line: The sweetly sexy guipure lace babydoll that closed the show balanced then and now in one seriously charming package.</p></div>"
87,spring,2004,s2004,pierrot,"In spring, wrote Tennyson, a young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love. In the case of quirky knitwear designer Pierrot, that sometimes means more of a triple-X affair than a tender, courtly romance.</p><p>Pierrot presented his collection on the soundstage of <em>The Maury Povich Show</em>, where he’d built a flimsy movie set, and had his models pretend to be making a porn flick, complete with roving film crew and cheesy props. It didn’t have all that much to do with the clothes, but there was a good-natured, low-budget charm to the performance. And with the exception of some disturbingly enthusiastic cameo appearances by Mimi Rogers (who, incidentally, looked pretty good in Pierrot’s clingy knits), it was all pretty G-rated.</p><p>As was the collection. Flippy skirts in delicate pink or white crochet, colorful little sweaters with humorously suggestive flower motifs, and pretty sweater dresses all make perfect springtime fare. Those who see knitwear as largely a winter category should take a closer look at this designer’s handiwork, with some caveats:The black knit chaps and the tops depicting very explicit sexual acts should probably go right back to wardrobe.</p></div>"
88,spring,2004,s2004,prada,"Over almost a decade of ground-breaking experimentalism, Miuccia Prada has explored everything from irony to deliberate ugliness to intellectual subversion. She’s been there, done that, and has the souvenirs to prove it. For Spring 2004, the designer turned her attention to the stiffest fashion challenge of the day: how to make feminine, happily nostalgic clothes without rehashing the clichés of vintage?</p><p>“It was about tourism and craftsmanship, many things,” she said of a show that revisited the optimistic fifties to bring back a full set of densely packed suitcases. Out tumbled every possible variation on the classic touring wardrobe: circle skirts printed with illustrated Mediterranean scenes, shirtwaists and Capri pants, sundresses and bathing suits, button-through skirts and lovely evening frocks, silk madras bras and little tulle full-skirted dance dresses.</p><p>What set the collection apart were the subtle twists, like the way Prada will gently mess up fabric with dip-dye and tie-dye, turn seams inside out, or leave edges raw. Something in the proportion of her neat little tops, belted slightly above the waist, to the fullness and length of her skirts, to the height of her T-strap shoes or pumps, inexplicably excuses the silhouette from the frumpiness of the literal fifties line. Meanwhile, students of Pradaology will note that her sight-seeing tour also revisits some favorite landmarks of her own career: the silk pleated goddess dresses, fur tippets, and grosgrain ribbons tied as belts, all of seasons past. Just another layer of complexity in a beautiful collection that will have women all over the world clamoring, once again, to go where Miuccia leads.</p></div>"
89,spring,2004,s2004,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Justin Thornton and Thea Bregazzi, one of several double-headed design labels in London, have good antennae; their Preen collection always manages to tune into the prevailing trends without losing its streetwear-inspired authenticity. For spring, the duo reconfigured used leather bomber jackets and cotton T-shirt materials into a body-conscious, lingerie-influenced collection that retained a gritty urban edge.</p><p>Preen worked puffy, asymmetric pieces of second-hand leather into jackets, jumpsuits, and outsize shoulderbags, and embellished with stretch beige foundation garments, garter belts, and falling-down bra straps. Vestiges of former garments, like the ribbed cotton welts of eighties blousons, or a trompe-l’oeil leather stocking-top, added an extra element of intrigue to the mix. Thornton and Bregazzi said they had been inspired by “glam-rock, David Bowie, and comic-strip superheroes,” and the resulting look—though it marches alongside that of Helmut Lang and Rick Owens—has a distinctive swagger all its own.</p></div>"
90,spring,2004,s2004,proenza-schouler,"In the great empty hull of the North Pavilion of New York’s Javits Center, Proenza Schouler floated out a sublime collection for Spring 2004. Changing course from fall's more structured shapes, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez loosened things up, describing their new silhouette as ""long and lean on top and full at the bottom, but all with a weightlessness and airiness."" To that end, silk charmeuse voile and gauze were worked up into flowing flapper dresses and breezy skirts paired with scoop-necked boyfriend sweaters worn down low over the hips. The twenties were also referenced with ropes of H. Stern pearls and black-and-white tweed jackets which nodded to Chanel.</p><p>To a soundtrack (by Brooklyn art/design collective Lansing-Dreiden) that evoked an appropriately nautical ebb and flow, summer classics bobbed up consistently throughout the collection. Canvas and seersucker were made up into sleek pants and highly covetous shrunken jackets. Eye-catching bathing suits and tank tops, in electric blue and mint, reprised the form-defining lines of the bustiers in the duo’s fall collection but with a bright, sporty twist. And for rainy days, there was a patent-leather, sequined raincoat so yellow as to challenge the sun to come out. Other highlights included a short black patent jacket, prepster staples like button-downs and shorts enlivened with a custom print, and a suede jacket in Nantucket red.</p><p>Makeup director Tom Pecheux described his brief for the show as ""sporty but fragile,"" which could well be applied to the entire collection—establishing Proenza Schouler firmly at the helm of a stylish vessel on a strong course.</p></div>"
91,spring,2004,s2004,rachel-comey,"Womenswear has been creeping gradually into Rachel Comey’s growing men’s line, finally reaching a critical mass for Spring 2004. In keeping with her now-dual focus, Comey (who also designs costumes for New York’s punk cabaret Gogol Bordello) opted for a straightforward runway show instead of her usual theatrical installation. Held in the outside promenade of New York’s Flatotel, it still had the dramatic flair that Comey’s enthusiastic young following has come to expect.</p><p>The first women’s exit was a little black jersey dress, constructed in layers, with crisscross ties and finished at the end with silver caps. Cut close on top, it was loose and forgiving at the bottom. Another black dress of tiered, crinkled chiffon, with a pencil-sketch print done for Comey by Clay Weiner, exemplified the “decorative but not too flashy” feeling she was aiming for. Most of the pieces she showed were designed, Comey said, as being “airy, light, and daytime,” which translated into an abundance of smart separates: tank tops worn under printed chiffon tops; a pencil skirt worn with a swingy, sharp-shouldered jacket; reversible blousons and shorts; and a lilac jacket with rip-stop nylon detailing borrowed from her sports-themed menswear. The overall mood was pure summer, and the collection full of confident, easy clothes for cool customers with discerning eyes.</p></div>"
92,spring,2004,s2004,ralph-lauren,"Ralph Lauren sets out to beautify his customer’s life without complicating it, and that philosophy has served him well; his far-reaching lifestyle empire now brings in about $2.4 billion a year. With his confident, colorful Spring collection, Lauren once again demonstrated his time-honored skill at balancing classic sportswear with a sense of luxury.</p><p>He started with a group of cream and black pieces inspired by the athletic life. There were tennis-flavored dresses, one in white silk with a polo collar and a swingy pleated skirt, another inspired by the classic cable-knit sweater with a plunging V-neckline; a pinstriped baseball jacket worn with a matching pencil skirt; a sequined varsity cardigan; and a sexy white silk gown with a silver mesh racer back that suggested fencing gear. Lauren cuts a great jacket, and there were plenty of terrific options in black silk stretch or white cotton, with nipped waists and a bit of flare over the hips to emphasize the female form.</p><p>For the second half, Lauren exploded into color, assembling tropical hues of violet, lime green, yellow, pink, and fuchsia and sending out classic man-tailored pantsuits worn with vivid contrasting cashmere sweaters and georgette shirts. The designer ended with a handful of utterly simple, perfectly cut liquid charmeuse gowns, in bird-of-paradise colors guaranteed to intoxicate.</p></div>"
93,spring,2004,s2004,rick-owens,"Funny how out-of-town designers get whipped into shape once they reach Paris. Rick Owens—he of the dark, Goth, crinkled layers—has discovered a new, lightened-up way of expressing his aesthetic now that he’s immersed himself in this city’s competitive fashion culture.</p><p>Owens cited Frenchmen Rene Gruau and Jean-Paul Goude as the two main influences on his Spring collection. And, though it was hard to trace his new body-consciousness and use of color to either 1950’s fashion graphics or 1980’s photographic manipulation, there is a detectable change going on here. In place of unrelentingly dark floor-dragging shapes, there were short skirts with floating asymmetric trails and stretch-gauze tops wrapping the breast and torso. Even the designer’s familiar shades of gray were interrupted by surprising washes of pink, peach, coral, paprika, pistachio, and aqua.</p><p>Not that Owens has abandoned the slouchy, raw-edged attitude—or the incredible washed leathers—so adored by his huge band of followers. It’s just that now he’s added hacked-off versions of 1930’s charmeuse skirts and ultra-refined whitewashed leather jackets, twisted into a tie and fastening at the neck, into his repertoire—not to mention high heels, slicked-back hair, and pink lipstick. Though he still needs to shape all that into a more concise runway statement, Owens is clearly taking this collection in the right direction.</p></div>"
94,spring,2004,s2004,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli opened his latest extravaganza with giant screen projections featuring fast-paced stills and video clips of Cher, specifically her wild seventies moments. The throbbing momentum of movie and soundtrack was so dramatic that it came as a crashing anticlimax when the diva herself—Cavalli’s muse of this and many another season—did not appear on the mirrored runway. And for all his devil-may-care bravura Cavalli seemed to find the arch, razzle-dazzle couture of Bob Mackie, who created Cher's most eye-popping looks, equally elusive.</p><p>Nonetheless, prints, brilliant color, and cabaret sparkle are all big news this season and Cavalli had them aplenty; his heady mix even included raunchy rodeo queens in tiny python jackets with rhinestone-beaded yokes or finely-chiseled leather chaps. Skin-tight cowgirl shirts and hourglass dresses featured prints of swirling pheasant and guinea fowl feathers—often embellished with the real thing—or of frenzied kaleidoscope effects that evoked Pompeian tiled courtyards. Cavalli also tapped a softer side of seventies fashion with sexy, layered, drifting chiffon print dresses that recalled Swinging London designer Ossie Clark (who's currently being celebrated in an influential exhibit at London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum).</p><p>A fussier side of evening was revealed in deftly draped gowns with elaborately structured bodices that had the come-hither appeal of saloon gals in a fifties spaghetti western. Subtlety has never been Cavalli's forte—how about a spotted cat jacket with diamond cutouts for an airy summer effect?—and somehow his floor-length pieces, slashed and bared as they are, reveal more than most designers’ swimsuits. Overall, his flamboyant results—an ivory goddess gown seemingly held together with threads of crystal, or midriff-baring costumes with skirts of ostrich pompons—ended up looking more Vegas showgirl than Cher.</p></div>"
95,spring,2004,s2004,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens is blessed with a rare romanticism, shot through with an almost invisible thread of something darker. For Rochas, he gathers up the lace, taffeta bows, silver lamé, delicate pink silks, and roses of old-world couture, and re-presents them as a modern bouquet—an offering to girls who have never seen prettiness through the eyes of one of their own generation. “I didn’t want to do a sexy siren,” he said. “Not trendy, not street, but something like a goddess from another world.”</p><p>That vision translated first into black lace, covering silver-gray suits with bolero jackets over short, slightly flared high-waisted skirts. Then corsetry came into play, exposed in swooping cutaway necklines beneath suits or structured into strapless dresses. All the while, he worked with tiny decorative edgings and frills, introducing oval lace insets (he calls them “cocoons”) that finally took over as the pattern dominating a few grand evening gowns.</p><p>Although Theyskens respects beauty and rejects the shock tactics, irony, and edginess of a previous generation, there’s something febrile in his imagination, too. The structure of his clothes was inspired, he said, by the work of Aloise Corbaz, a schizophrenic 1920’s outsider artist who painted naïvely magical figures of women in breast-exposing dresses. That strange undercurrent didn’t prevent him from sending out a couple of voluminous tulle wonders that will walk beautifully on any red carpet. But it adds to the sense that this young designer is capable of skewing the apparently conventional in a fascinatingly different way.</p></div>"
96,spring,2004,s2004,roland-mouret,"Roland Mouret, a Frenchman who has become something of a star in the London fashion world, brought his collection to New York for the first time this season. He came to the attention of the press over three years ago when he began to show what has now become his signature—seamless draped dresses held together with just a pin.</p><p>For Spring, Mouret reprised the themes of his Fall 2003 collection, which blended mod-style tailoring with <em>Barbarella</em>-inspired accents. Exploring the clash of hard and soft, he translated Fall's patent-leather harnesses into knit bathing suits—a new category for the designer—and showed a softly draped gown with an unexpected breastplate embellished with pieces of antique mirror. There were beautiful coats, like the strong white structured one that opened the show and the bathrobe-style piece in white satin, and several marvelous draped and layered tanks—some produced via extraordinary feats of suspension, others featuring beautiful embroidery. Dresses combined Grecian drape with flapper flow and came out short and sexy or with long, languorous, mermaid-like trains.</p><p>Less successful were Mouret’s attempts at raunch—zippered, leather proto-punk/biker vests and jackets—and gimmicks like Noel Stewart's Mickey Mouse hats, which detracted from the focus of the collection. Overall, however, the show lived up to its title: ""Smiling in the Bright Lights.""</p></div>"
97,spring,2004,s2004,saint-laurent,"“It was woman as dandy,” declared Tom Ford of the sinuous twenties and thirties feel he melded into satins and chiffons for YSL’s Spring collection. The designer narrowed and lengthened Saint Laurent’s original boxy, hard-edged lines, opening with louchely draped powder-blue satin suits. The jackets closed with wide hip fastenings over a new-shaped pant that was cut loose to the knee, then caught tight with rows of tiny covered buttons.</p><p>Ford’s skew on House retro synthesized masculine and feminine elements: a low-belted, gold-buttoned trench was paired with rib-cuffed jog pants, while petaled jersey skirts flew out from under skintight black leather jackets. Reruns of the classic smokings included tuxes, white vests, and mannish dressing gowns, cut floppy and liable to fall open at the breast at any moment. Together with the major frizzed hairdos and sexy high-heeled spectator shoes in leather and canvas, it added up to a new silhouette for the tall, sexually-in-control woman Ford envisions as the spirit of modern YSL.</p><p>She’s just as powerful-looking in a dress, of course. Karen Elson (who, with her alabaster complexion and ginger hair, is making a comeback as the perfect pre-war muse this season) symbolized that strength, striding out in palest pink bias-cut jersey, pieced in a twenties diamond-pattern at the hip and with handkerchief points flying from shoulder and hem. There followed a line of equally individual gowns in satin and chiffon, worked with curving scalloped layers and plissé skirts and held up by the finest shoulder straps.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gvxo9q""></div></div><p>The visions of pared-down, re-imagined Deco glamour kept coming. There were more sober options in black, with strands of jet beading moving over dark georgette, but they were finally upstaged by a sensational misty blue chiffon gown, delicately suspended from strings of crystal and swinging sparkling fringe, and a white dress smothered in gold coins with delicate pleats fanning out in the skirt. The details in this deluge of gorgeousness were equally unmissable: the new horn-handled pony-skin bags, and the enticingly luxe diamond jewelry. That turned out to come from Boucheron, not YSL—but since they are sister companies in the Gucci Group, it made for a clever piece of borrowing.</p></div>"
98,spring,2004,s2004,sebastian-pons,"Sometimes you <em>can</em> go home again. Sebastian Pons was born in Majorca, graduated from London’s Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, spent some time working with Alexander McQueen, and then moved to New York to join Miguel Adrover’s design team. Yet it was only after Pons returned to his native island that he debuted his first collection here, following an intensive period of research about the early history of fashion. If your idea of early means vintage, think again; his collection, called Itaca, was a sartorial excursion through the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, and Southeast Asia, with some contemporary Spanish spice sprinkled throughout.</p><p>Opening in ancient mode, Pons showed a one-shouldered toga in a natural tint, followed closely by another in Roman purple. He used linen, a fabric with an appropriately venerable past, for a series of marvelous dresses: one with simple decorative stitching, like a converted table cloth; another embroidered in blue; yet another painted by hand with a pomegranate motif. Some of the most chic pieces in the collection were the suits—a kind of <em>campesino</em> take on Chanel, with drop-waisted skirts and embroidered cardigan jackets that laced up the front and at the wrist. The concept was repeated to more bohemian effect with rustic Ikat prints and added fringes.</p><p>As the show progressed the clothes became more decorative, moving through knits in Arabian-inspired patterns and hues to end in a souk-like riot of color: pink and green chiffons stitched with semi-precious stones; a chemise entirely embroidered in colored threads and pieces of mirror; and simple dresses with floral prints and pretty ribbon trims. Overall, Pons achieved an impressive balance between the classic and the decorative, launching his fashion caravan on what looks set to be a thrilling journey.</p></div>"
99,spring,2004,s2004,sonia-rykiel,"How <em>does</em> she do it? Sonia Rykiel's collection managed to be both a recap of her greatest hits and yet still look fresh and in sync with everything currently hip in fashion. From her trademark skinny rib sweaters in multicolored bands worn with fashionably short microshorts to her signature floaty dresses (this season dappled with poppies, stars, and pansies), Rykiel was right on target. Ditto her quintessential black tailoring—but then long, lean, and languid never really goes out of fashion.</p><p>What's most extraordinary about this defiantly young-spirited woman (now in her 70s) is her passion for sexy clothes that never dip into vulgar. That's true even for pieces like the mesh black body stockings decorated with Rykiel's beloved crystal and presented so nonchalantly (one with a built-in G-string!); they looked like something a trapeze artist at a racy Parisian circus might wear.</p><p>Given Rykiel's frank enjoyment of the sensual, it seemed only fitting that she'd share it with her audience. For the finale, she sent out a troop of handsome men to spritz the air with her new scent, Rykiel Woman—and then let her bra-clad models smooch and canoodle with the boys. Now here's a woman who has perfected the twin arts of nice and naughty.</p></div>"
100,spring,2004,s2004,sophia-kokosalaki,"Sophia Kokosalaki is a Greek designer who’s growing into the idea of letting her classical roots show. For spring, she used goddess-y draping and Fortunyesque pleating in tiny, sexy dresses and tops crafted to clasp around a perfect body. Working with a lightened-up palette of shell pink, pale terra cotta, and muted aqua, and an occasional sparkling underlay of Swarovski crystal, she also cast off her customary dark, new-wave influences—for the time being, anyway.</p><p>Kokosalaki has always had a knack for adapting elements of her cultural background to suit the mood of the season. When fashion was in a folksy moment, she made her reputation with Empire dresses that had a Cretan peasant feel. Now that she’s been selected to design the costumes for the Athens Olympics, it should hardly be surprising that she’s celebrating the beauty of classical Greek sculpture—in a form that a modern girl might wear clubbing. Was it a long, hot summer working in the Olympics office that also influenced Kokosalaki to cut her daywear down to a few pairs of shorts and the odd cropped leather shirt? If so, that’s a bit of a shame. The dresses will look fabulous in photos, but a little more in the way of daily clothing for mere mortals wouldn’t have gone amiss.</p></div>"
101,spring,2004,s2004,stella-mccartney,"Confidence, confidence, confidence! What a treat it was to see Stella McCartney in self-assured mode, her finger firmly on fashion's current pulse.</p><p>Gone were the tricky corsetry, the bland biscuit shades, the reworked vintage pieces of previous collections. Instead, McCartney sent out strong color—aqua, spearmint, jade, lemon, pink—and banished references to iconic designers’ past hits, relying on her own keen sense of what makes clothes graceful and cool. For the former, there were the dresses suspended by superfine straps, and filmy skirts of petal-like chiffon layers, all artfully blown by wind machines as the models struck their poses. Hip was defined by a crème de menthe silk blouson, or the sharp, sexy pants that came with milky-colored chiffon tops hung from latex straps. McCartney licked the ballet trend currently pirouetting its way through Paris, with second-skin jerseys and knitted rib warmers over floaty minis. The accessories looked great too: flesh-toned, transparent-strapped shoes and metal-trimmed bags embellished with enamel stones. Those, and the delicate eveningwear—embroidered and smocked with gold thread—will have her fans in raptures next spring.</p><p>Back to the confidence issue. Could it be her recent marriage to Alasdhair Willis that has finally anchored McCartney’s self-reliance? Whatever the reason, the Stella McCartney woman is no longer trying too hard. She's all grown up, and looks much better for it.</p></div>"
102,spring,2004,s2004,stephen-burrows,"Welcome to Stephen Burrows’ World—again. One of the preeminent American designers of the seventies, Burrows is beloved by the cognoscenti, but little known by the public, despite having won three Coty Awards and been one of only five American designers to represent the U.S. at the legendary 1973 fashion exposition in the Palace of Versailles. Last year, Henri Bendel, where Burrows had a hugely successful boutique back in his day, relaunched the designer with a brand-new, in-store atelier. For his Spring 2003 show, his first of the twenty-first century, he invited “the Misses” (his term for seventies supermodels like Alva Chinn, Pat Cleveland, and Karen Bjornson) to walk for him, but made no other concessions to the past. ""I want to be to be as modern as I can,” said the designer, and sent out a resolutely up-to-the minute collection to prove it.</p><p>Burrows prefers clingy, flowing materials like silk and jersey, and worked these into deceptively simple column dresses with wonderful variants on the halter top. Some incorporated ribbons, others were cut high on the leg, still others pulled off virtuoso feats of engineering, but all gave an impression of grace and fluidity. Daytime looks included a bright jersey dress with a track suit-like jacket and a black ensemble with red top stitching (a reference to the designer's original, signature, red-stitched lettuce hems). Long a champion of bold colors, Burrows built this collection around vibrant hues—citrus yellows, ocean blues, and orchid reds—inspired by ""tropical fruits and the lushness of an island rainforest.""</p></div>"
103,spring,2004,s2004,temperley-london,"Alice Temperley is London’s answer to Zac Posen, in female form: an out-of-nowhere designer who has already gathered an adoring posse of young socialites, fashion eds, and models who whip around town, flipping their pastel-hued, scallop-edged hems and passing on her name with delighted sighs.</p><p>Starting from her Notting Hill studio, Alice has grown and grown, almost entirely by word of mouth, to the point where she’s recently been able to open a “private dressing showroom” in a Soho loft. She makes dresses for urban nymphets who like liberal sprinklings of ruffles and fairy-dust sparkles in their midsummer night’s party-hopping wardrobes. Come spring, they’ll be calling Alice for an appointment to riffle through a vaguely thirties-cum-fifties collection that she describes as having been inspired by a James Thurber story about a princess who asked for the moon. Decisions, decisions! Will it be a rose-pink chiffon dress with ivory, crystal-beaded French lace at the shoulders and a ribbon tied in a bow at the waist? An innocent white eyelet gown with an aqua lining peeping through? Or that mouth-watering, full-length lingerie dress in palest mango sorbet chiffon with a cutout lace bodice? Whichever they choose, this is a collection that has no pretensions about altering the path of fashion. Temperley’s clothes will never cut it with London’s serious avant-garde, but rather will waft along effortlessly on the young lady-like breeze that’s blowing through spring—and manage it with a lot of charm.</p></div>"
104,spring,2004,s2004,tim-van-steenbergen,"Tap, tap, tap went the tips of their toes, as the Antwerp Royal Ballet School ballerinas modeling Tim Van Steenbergen’s collection pranced down the runway <em>en pointe</em>—an apt choice for his collection of balletic workwear.</p><p>Van Steenbergen is part of the new generation of Antwerp designers currently sweeping Paris. Coming from fashion’s creative petri dish, it’s to be expected that his clothes would be anything but literal; in other words, <em>Swan Lake</em> it was not. There were dance references aplenty: asymmetric hems cut from fluid layers, workout trousers with elastic cuffs, shrunken wrap tops, V-neck tanks with runs in them, and knitted leggings. But there were also bright green belted trenchcoats, voluminous bubble-shaped skirts gathered with rope at the hem, and dainty dresses embroidered with satin flowers and trailing ribbons.</p><p>And what on earth was that jacket with puffed wrists, embellished with great gobs of crystal and sequins, and dripping with beads? “I wanted to mix costumes that a dancer might wear onstage with her workout gear,” explained the 25-year-old van Steenbergen, confiding that he spent many an evening decorating said jacket on his sofa in front of the television. The costume element also explained a great white skirt layered over thick lace petticoats, like something worn by an antique porcelain doll. Romantic, yet original; it will be interesting to see where this young designer’s imagination heads next.</p></div>"
105,spring,2004,s2004,tommy-hilfiger,"“It’s about color,” Tommy Hilfiger said a few days before his Spring 2004 show. “Color and fun.” He might have added “ease,” too, because there wasn’t a stiff fabric or a tricky cut in his cheerful, carefree collection.</p><p>The show did have a few anxious moments: There was a rock star–worthy crush at the door due to the presence of Pharrell Williams, who performed the runway music. But once the beat kicked in and the clothes streamed out, the tension evaporated. Who could be stressed by a pair of light-as-air drawstring pants worn with a tummy-grazing silk pique tee, or a clean white taffeta dress with brisk orange grosgrain ribbon? Hilfiger has made his name—and considerable fortune—by dusting off preppy classics, and he repeated the trick tonight via hot hues like apple green, neon pink, orange, and blue, all played off white basics. He loosened up the silhouette, too, with full-leg jeans, billowy sheer hoodies, and silky pleated skirts.</p><p>While most of the styles were daytime-specific, the designer didn’t completely neglect the nightlife. A fluttery pink gown, or a hot-pink chiffon dress, its bodice wrapped in multicolored ribbon, kept the mood upbeat right to the end.</p></div>"
106,spring,2004,s2004,tuleh,"Bryan Bradley’s first runway show as the sole name behind Tuleh (he and partner Josh Patner split earlier this year) was brief—only 27 looks. But it was a perfect demonstration of the skills that make him the go-to designer in the socialite stratosphere.</p><p>Bradley sent out lovely chiffon dresses in garden-party colors like lime, lilac, rose, and lemon yellow, and incorporated witty tailoring touches like extended cuffs and geometric topstitching on a trench coat. This designer has an unusually sure hand with colors and prints: He paired a pink silk polka-dot dress with a pink-and-white silk brocade coat; put silver lace over a pink gown; and paired a khaki trench with an aqua lace dress. It wasn’t all about chiffon, either. Bradley worked in some nifty new fabrics, like a khaki tweed shot through with silver thread for a boxy little jacket, and a black silk faille with white pindots for a mod coat.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, Bradley knows the answer to a very important question: Just how much sexiness do his high-profile customers want? Answer: more than a hint, but less than a salvo. He strikes just the right balance via fluttering ruffles (fashion’s way of saying “yoo-hoo!”) in all the right places; lingerie details like seams picked out in attention-getting black leather; and a figure-friendly cut that flatters the female form, but never makes unreasonable demands. Just like the ideal man.</p></div>"
107,spring,2004,s2004,undercover,"Jun Takahashi showed his collection on pairs of identical twins: How sweet! Each sister act came out with matching hairdos and wearing different versions of the same outfit—one playing it straight, the other a visual meltdown of the look, like a reflection in a fairground mirror. Takahashi worked his idea across a range of fashion standards, like sailor tees and khakis, white shirts and black pants, French trenches with Kelly bags, and American blue jeans and baseball shirts.</p><p>Shows like these are what fashion’s cool-seekers come to Paris to see: ideas that make you smile, but also engage the brain. For all its surface innocence and playfulness, the Undercover collection always has, as its name suggests, a subtext. This season, the pacifist Takahashi weighed in on the origins of current world conflicts. On the soundtrack, John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band raged against organized religion (“I don’t believe in Jesus...I don’t believe in Buddha”) while the twins massed together for a finale wearing T-shirts reading, “Violence invites violence,” “Silly to kill,” and “Who wants to be a soldier.”</p></div>"
108,spring,2004,s2004,valentino,"When the fashion chat is all about the ""new ladylike,"" it's not hard to give in to the methods of seduction Valentino has perfected. He's had ""lady"" down pat for years—for the genuine ones of the yacht-owning class, that is. His Spring collection covers the waterfront for that society, and those who aspire to it.</p><p>Valentino knows exactly how to translate this season's messages about lace and lingerie into infinitely fragile corseted dresses with gently falling frills. How to tie up a little rose chiffon dress with a lavender ribbon. How to decorate a summer suede jacket with a smattering of sequined bobbles, and fashion a suit out of the lightest, palest liquid satin. Get him on the subject of nautical, and he will show (on his friend Naomi Campbell, no less) how pristinely perfect something as simple as a pair of white sailor pants and a navy silk sweater can look.</p><p>There was also a theme of butterflies flitting through this collection in prints, on canvas day bags, belts, and hair ornaments, and set into the clasps of metal mesh evening purses. It all looked romantically pretty in the just-so mode that his clients adore. Yet the applause for this show was for the ultimately feminine evening pieces that appeared in his finale: an extraordinary turquoise draped jersey goddess dress, and a single, brilliant red chiffon ruffled gown, short in front and trailing out behind. It's the stuff of fantasy, certainly. But in Valentino's world, it's also the reality that will keep his many fans coming back for more.</p></div>"
109,spring,2004,s2004,vera-wang,"Pretty may be the trend for spring, but it’s nothing new for Vera Wang; she’s made a career of unfussy elegance. Her latest collection, full of lovely, understated separates and drop-dead gowns that are red-carpet ready, showcased her undeniable skill.</p><p>She touched on the season’s mood with stunning jersey goddess gowns in rich green and brilliant red that worked as perfect foils to Wang's diamond jewelry. The twenties feeling came up via cocktail dresses embroidered with scallops of gold thread and, in one example, embellished with a tart chartreuse ribbon. The slightly raised waistline that she used throughout the collection—even a snug navy coat had a high belt at the back—referred to a gentler, more ladylike era without ever getting sentimental or overly retro. In fact, Wang knows how to keep it modern, too: She paired a classic smoking with the most feminine tops (think pleated tulle, embroidered net) and beautifully-cut tuxedo trousers, a totally contemporary look that provided the perfect balance to her plethora of charming party dresses.</p></div>"
110,spring,2004,s2004,veronique-branquinho,"Veronique Branquinho resists categorization. Though a citizen of Antwerp, she’s never been a Belgian Goth—but neither does she quite belong to the sunny, frilly side of fashion. Her focus, instead, is on making clothes that will allow young women to enjoy their femininity without somehow compromising their dignity. Her summer centers around just a few sound, unfreakish ideas: plain satin shift dresses and lace-trimmed slips, fine decorative camisoles and pleated wrap skirts.</p><p>Branquinho’s sensitive details include wing-shaped beaded motifs on the front of T-shirts, sheer trimmings at the base of scooped-out backs, and lace bandeau bras as underpinnings. She methodically offers those pieces, without fanfare or conceptual presentation, in black, cream, or vibrant vermilion. The mixed black-and-white striped print, or the occasional trenchcoat and ombré-dyed dress shading from brown to red varied her message. It didn’t qualify as one of the blockbusters of Paris fashion week, but when it comes down to summer wearability, Branquinho’s contribution on the subjects of lingerie and dresses looks appealingly practical.</p></div>"
111,spring,2004,s2004,versace,"With Beyoncé and Mariah Carey lined up as her front-row celebrity focus group, it came as no surprise when Donatella Versace trotted out an eye-popping spectacle of color and print. Versace’s multihued petal power overflowed with hothouse citrus, turquoise, pink, and violet—all those shades that look best in the sun, on utterly bodacious bodies.</p><p>Using a combination of stretchy draped tops, thigh-hugging pedal pushers, and a huge rush of floral gowns, Versace reprised something of the exuberant eighties optimism for which her brother Gianni was known. (Linda Evangelista walked the show as a reminder of those high old days.) There were halternecks, bra tops, and flouncy rumba blouses. A turquoise suit—if a jacket and a pair of micro shorts qualifies for such a description—came printed with magenta daisies. Tiny chiffon ruffles trimmed everything from plunging necklines on trailing evening gowns to provocative bikini bottoms. There were some calmer moments, like white suits and a couple of tooled leather, frill-embellished jackets and coats. But as the models strode up and down, big hair bouncing and curves outlined to the max, this looked like a collection aimed directly at divas.</p></div>"
112,spring,2004,s2004,versus-versace,"A runway collection inspired by a furniture movement: Is this a first? The Versus line for Spring 2004 was a fashion version of Memphis, Ettore Sottsass’s early eighties design company. Donatella Versace applied the group’s graphic blocks, striped bands, and screwy clashes of primary and pastel colors to all things tight and short, strapping clothes onto the body with stretchy harnesses or wide elasticized bands. Meanwhile, a mammoth screen at the back of the set showed lithe silhouettes dancing against the offbeat patterns—one like a print of medicine capsules—that appeared on the clothes.</p><p>The result may have been cleaner and more athletic than Versace’s usual trashed-up, rock-chick vision, but it was a sharp departure from the sweet and girly message the rest of Milan has been putting out. On the other hand, the odd bizarre item (like a teal-and-salmon printed leather anorak; or a pair of crazy multi-striped, color-blocked wedges) might strike a girl as just the thing to break up the monotony of next summer’s wall-to-wall prettiness.</p></div>"
113,spring,2004,s2004,viktor-rolf,"Here’s what fashion people expect of a Viktor &amp; Rolf show: surreal twists on convention and mind-bending sculptural exaggerations of normal clothing, ending in a crescendo of all-out applause for the quiet genius of the straight-faced Dutch duo. In a week when the two have celebrated their ten-year collaboration with an exhibition of their impressive body of work at the Musée de la Mode, the anticipation of the Spring show was ratcheted even higher than usual.</p><p>Strangely, though, this collection somehow failed to rise to the occasion. The well-established signatures—masculine/feminine tailoring, denims, and details like big, overblown bows—ranged the runway in many variations, but a high concept never quite materialized. A lot of audience second-guessing went on as the show progressed. Was this Viktor &amp; Rolf’s statement of post-conceptual commerciality? Were all the big white shirts and softened shapes their new ironic take on bourgeois ordinariness? If so, many of the pieces were rather too literally banal to jolt a reaction.</p><p>The designers’eveningwear picked up strength, with versions of tuxedo jackets cut so as to hang off the shoulder (a dangling motif that is recurring throughout the Spring collections). More promising still were the interpretations of grand 1950’s tulle evening gowns, their skirts morphed onto men’s dinner suits. At a time when young avant-garde designers are reinvestigating the beauty of traditional Parisian couture, that was a tantalizing contribution to the season. But it left Viktor &amp; Rolf’s fans longing for more.</p></div>"
114,spring,2004,s2004,y-3,"Go, team! With sports-inspired clothes becoming ever more firmly entrenched in the every person wardrobe, Y-3—Yohji Yamamoto’s collaboration with Adidas—is practically a fail-safe proposition. For spring, the project hit its mark with a high-energy collection that went from simple jackets and warm-ups to sleekly sexy swimsuits.</p><p>As might be expected from a line that celebrates the sporting life, the tops, trousers, and skirts were mostly kept lean, while anoraks and sweatshirts were oversized and slouchy, meant to be worn slipping off the shoulders. There were some specific references to track and field: referee stripes on maillots, for example, or plastic panels inspired by motocross boots attached to jacket sleeves. Mostly, though, Y-3 concentrated on making over generally utilitarian pieces like trim jackets and skirts with high-tech fabrics and sharp color combinations: black, white, and gray flashed with hot pink and electric blue.</p><p>Yamamoto’s sense of irreverence could be felt throughout. Logos were blown up to cartoonish proportions; men sported hot pink hoodies; a strapless one-piece sweatsuit was supersized way beyond the realm of the sporty. He also worked with Japanese artist Saeko Tsuemura on comic book–style graphics that were printed on tank dresses, fluid jersey pants, and generous wraparound leather jackets. Overall, it was enough to lure even hard-core couch potatoes into a shopping trip—preferably after a visit to the gym.</p></div>"
115,spring,2004,s2004,ys-yohji-yamamoto,"Having shifted his main collection to a slot during Paris's couture week, Yohji Yamamoto has deputized his secondary line, Y's, to represent him at the ready-to-wear shows. That didn't deter his audience, which was sitting up straight, pens poised, raring to see what new crimp the great innovator would be putting on the season. How about gauzy, droopy white knits and what looked like sweaters, dangling upside down from suspenders, worn as pants?</p><p>Legs in sleeves notwithstanding, Yamamoto’s floating, A-line asymmetries had the easy, nonaggressive air that has characterized his work from the beginning. Yet as model after model in neutral, wrinkled layers of crispy knit and floppy satin kept wandering down the runway, it became clear that there was not a lot of incisive new thinking going on. Things perked up when he sent out a shot of intense red washed satin, and a gentle version of the season’s shirt-dressing theme; otherwise, underwhelming was the word for it. Sure, Yamamoto is being realistic in showing his accessibly-priced collection now. But in the Paris spotlight, the world still expects more from him than a routine dilution of house standards.</p></div>"
116,spring,2004,s2004,yohji-yamamoto,"Once again, Yohji Yamamoto chose to show his Ready-to-Wear line during Couture, a full two months ahead of the usual schedule. This Spring collection, he said, was an exercise in “doing something graphic.” That meant working squares of fabric, linked Paco Rabanne–style with metal rings, into many variations of bodices, which came attached to long, flowing skirts. The surprise was the sense of body that came through—literally. Though he stayed almost entirely with his habitual black, cutting pinafore dresses and overalls suspended from complex straps and ties, the torso beneath was naked, save for body paint, applied in chalky blocks by Shiseido. The focus was mainly on evening, save for a series of arty takes on that most American of classic looks: the white tee and jeans. Skintight gauze T-shirts, again stretched over painted torsos, were paired with baggy, low-hanging, washed-out denims, a cross-bred version of hip-hop pants and Japanese workwear. The one shot of color in the show arrived in the footwear: chunky foam platform flip-flops—some attached to toeless, heel-less neoprene socks—in bright red, leaf green, turquoise, and yellow, that came over as a sporty take on Japanese geta. Naturally, all were emblazoned with three white go-faster stripes, in a nod to the designer’s ongoing collaboration with Adidas.</p></div>"
117,spring,2004,s2004,zac-posen,"He’s not just a one-hit wonder, after all. In a lovely and lively Spring collection, Zac Posen showed he can move beyond the hourglass diva dresses and turn out some seriously pretty clothing.</p><p>Posen’s whole silhouette eased up as he worked in lighter fabrics like charmeuse and chiffon, and in a classic pastel palette of lilac, petal pink, pale green, and shimmery gray. Skillful tailoring showed up in short jackets artfully seamed to curve in at the waist, and a delicate touch was apparent in pieces like a halter dress suspended from a single, thin twist of fabric. Still in evidence were handkerchief-point hems on a few short dresses and skirts, as well as a few of his signature mitre-stripe gowns. It’s clear that Posen has been taking notes during his many appearances on the social circuit: His eveningwear, like a silvery sequined dress or a flame-red chiffon gown, will certainly delight the cocktail-and-gala crowd. And indeed, the whole show had a distinct sparkle, thanks to the $30 million worth of Harry Winston gems (on loan, of course) the models were sporting.</p><p>Lest his audience might think he’d lost his costume-y sense of humor, Posen also sent out two dangerously flammable outfits made from raffia—inspired, perhaps, by the wild Philip Treacy wigs on show at Manolo Blahnik’s current New York exhibit.</p></div>"
118,spring,2004,s2004,zero-maria-cornejo,"Maria Cornejo designs for women who prefer sleek and spare over pretty and perky, and her cool, even-tempered Spring collection was a refreshing counterpoint to the season’s plethora of lace and ruffles. Cornejo opened with a series of clean, narrow dresses and skirts in black and white jersey, gently enlivened with inserts and sashes made from pale blue silk.</p><p>She limited herself to four colors, but kept the outfits interesting by juxtaposing fabrics like Ultrasuede and charmeuse. Even when the jolts of red came out, in a gently ruched dress, a stretch mini, and a pair of cotton shorts, they seemed more studied than outright sexy. Cornejo’s proportions owe a debt to Japan in general, and designers like Issey Miyake in particular, but she puts her own stamp on things by way of body-conscious cuts and modern fabrics.</p></div>"
1,fall,2004,f2004,a-f-vandevorst,"First, the bad news. While there was much to admire in A.F. Vandevorst's Fall show, there were a few reasons why it didn't fly quite as well as it could have. It's never a good idea to present your collection way out of the center of Paris at night—a very cold night, at that—and then keep your audience shivering on the sidelines for more than an hour in subzero temperatures. Serving Champagne—chilled, <em>naturellement</em>—might score brownie points with some, but at this stage in the evening hot cocoa would probably have been a bigger hit. Just why it was so cold became apparent when the show finally started. An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx, the duo behind the label, had opened up the vast auditorium in order to allow the models to enter from outside, deposited by a fleet of Lexus limousines that drew up at the entrance.</p><p>Once the girls started to stalk the square runway in a complicated formation sequence, things began to heat up: An and Filip put their own sharp twist on the pretty, polished femininity that's a recurring theme this season, with a smart tie-belted cardigan jacket in a magnified houndstooth tweed; a lacquered black lace circle skirt; and a decidedly chic cream bouclé tweed coat. The good news also included the now-trademark looks with which they opened and closed the proceedings—a belted trench with voluminous caped sleeves.</p><p>Intermixed with these standouts, however, were endless military-influenced jackets and shirts strewn with braiding, or pinned with medals. It may have been a comment on war and the military, but it led the collection directly into no-man's-land—and a chilly one, at that.</p></div>"
2,fall,2004,f2004,akris,"Every season has one or two of those shows where a well-respected but not terribly exciting line suddenly whips off its glasses, undoes a few buttons, and shakes out its topknot, leaving jaded fashion-world regulars stuttering over their words and groping for notebooks. This time, that delightful transformation happened at the venerable, 60-year-old Swiss company Akris. There's always been an upper-echelon customer for its painstakingly perfect suits and coats, but over the past few years, with Albert Kriemler (son of founder Max Kriemler) at the helm, Akris has been quietly freshening and lightening its designs, and fall's show proved the transformation complete.</p><p>As much as this season's frill and flourish are fun to look at, ultimately women want clothes that can survive a grab-and-go lifestyle while still performing the important role of personal enhancement. Enter Akris' nip-waist jackets, trim trousers, pencil skirts, and snappy coats cut from cashmere, tweed, suede, and lamb, worn with luxe cashmere sweaters or silky tunics. Those kinds of basics can easily turn boring, but Kriemler has a gift for proportion and cut, and he managed to balance all the elements—rough with polish, bulky with airy—without getting bogged down in tradition. The silky dresses and gowns that closed the show emitted just the right amount of subtle sex appeal. And, while his fluttery smocked chiffon tops may have Swiss milkmaid in their genealogy, their flirty confidence was purely modern-day.</p></div>"
3,fall,2004,f2004,alberta-ferretti,"Alberta Ferretti's dressmaker sensibility is a trump card in a season that's all about the pretty-vintage look. Her abiding love of fluttery fabrics, allied to her ability to cut a nice coat, made for a collection that trod a light path through the current trends.</p><p>Opening with a soft, raw-edged tweed coat, Ferretti hit on an easy direction that stayed just the right side of prissy. Using a motif of circular cuts with unfinished seams, she whipped up little silk dresses with multiple tiers in absinthe green, dusty amethyst, faded harebell, and poudre pink. For warmth—it's winter, after all—she added printed fur jackets and stoles, opaque tights, and chunky wedges.</p><p>With their hair in slightly mussed bouffant ponytails and their eyes smudged with dark eyeliner, Ferretti's girls projected a kind of undone, retro glamour that made the prospect of winter dressing-up look almost easy.</p></div>"
4,fall,2004,f2004,alessandro-dell-acqua,"Is eccentric the new normal? That's the odd inversion beginning to spring to mind, as more and more shows fall in uniformly behind the E word. Of course, there's nothing deranged or random about most Milanese designers' choice of inspiration: They know a commercial direction when they see one. In Alessandro Dell'Acqua's case, he called up an out-there muse of the moment in the form of Courtney Love, as he imagines she¿d look after rummaging through a twenties wardrobe that was actually designed in the seventies.</p><p>What does that mean? Antique-looking tiered velvet dresses pulled on over sweaters and glitter-heeled ankle-strap shoes, for a start. But this wasn't wholly a dose of grunge revisited after a heavy night out. For an indigenous angle on early seventies glamour, Dell'Acqua referenced the late cult Italian design hero Walter Albini. That came through in Lurex knits, worn with matching jersey turbans and paired with high-waist flares, and in a reprise of the mixed Deco-patterned jacquard sweaters that were part of Albini's nostalgic métier.</p><p>One outfit—a loopy pink-mohair backless sweater, worn with a sparkly silver shirt collar and a pair of white pants—nailed the disco-fabulous era nicely. There was rather more Miuccia than Courtney in this collection (fabric-covered, beaded disc brooches landed on jackets and dresses), but few designers anywhere can completely escape the influence of Milan's own great homegrown eccentric—especially this season.</p></div>"
5,fall,2004,f2004,alexander-mcqueen,"It's only understandable that if the man who's been at the eye of the whirlwind of negotiations about taking up the reins at Yves Saint Laurent might have been thrown into an emotional spin. As we now know, Alexander McQueen turned down the offer, saying that it was far more important for him to concentrate on his own label. But although his fundamental instincts may be sound, the pain, strain, and self-questioning of recent weeks showed in this collection.</p><p>McQueen's intention, he said, was to strip away ""all theatrics and focus purely on design."" In one way, his declaration is right on: Fashion, hedged about with so much overcomplicated stuff, does feel in want of a good, rigorous cleansing. Perhaps that's why the show looked like a strange kind of rebirthing. His first model, in flesh-pale slippery jersey from top to toe, looked like an embryonic alien being, stepping with horrible vulnerability from a spacecraft onto a kind of landing pad. She led out a parade of similarly nude-colored outfits in tweed, double-faced cashmere, leather, jersey, and chiffon, in which McQueen seemed to be trying to summarize the essence of his design identity. He pared it down to some of his familiar shapes—jumpsuits, molded hourglass coats, nipped-waist suits—all shorn of the elaborate fabrics and embroideries of past seasons. The best of his coats was an ivory swing-skirted shearling, one of the most believably commercial items in the collection.</p><p>Yet, throughout there was a sense that the audience was waiting for the moment when this sci-fi-accented show would take off in the usual, thrilling, turbo-charged McQueen manner. A couple of frosted Mongolian-lamb hooded jackets almost did it, but then the mood subsided again into evening, where the long jersey draped dresses looked as if they might have been designed in a mood when McQueen's mind really had been turned toward Saint Laurent.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ii5f08""></div></div><p>It was a pity—if only human—that the collection didn't quite live up to expectations at such a crucial time for McQueen. But then again, this is fashion. There's always next season.</p></div>"
6,fall,2004,f2004,ann-demeulemeester,"As Ann Demeulemeester's show drew to a close, it seemed the unthinkable was about to happen. The collection, shown to a sweeping, dramatic, classical score, had not a whisper (or, more appropriately, a wail) from the Belgian designer's favorite chanteuse, Patti Smith. But then the orchestra's strings faded—and the opening chords of Smith's <em>Horses</em> rang out.</p><p>Expecting Demeulemeester to abandon Smith would be akin to seeing her show bright, pretty florals: It's just never going to happen. She has laid claim to a dark, gothic sensibility that variously embraces military uniforms, slouchy tailoring, and raw-edged shearlings and furs mixed with tough leathers. The results tend to be of varying returns: sometimes rather wonderful, sometimes not.</p><p>This collection wasn't far from the former category. The drawbacks were the buckled straps that messily crisscrossed fur vests and dipping asymmetric skirts, and her penchant for partnering her sharp leather or ponyskin biker-style jackets with jodhpurs—surely up there with jumpsuits as one of the worst things a woman can wear. This aside, there was a lot that was good: narrow-shouldered, high-collared coats that buttoned on the side and oversized blousons that were based on the trench, the volume kept under control by their low-slung belts. And there were some wonderful surprises: a flash of silver from chain mail minis layered with big sweaters and tight pants; glossy leather gauntlets whose cuffs were lavished with fur; and a color palette that strayed beyond black to include chestnut brown, soft vanilla, and winter white—the latter at its best in a glazed-leather trenchcoat.</p></div>"
7,fall,2004,f2004,anna-molinari,"Bette Midler playing Janis Joplin in <em>The Rose</em> meets Virginia Woolf. Such are the entertaining tropes being used backstage to explain the outbreak of individualism in fall's fashion; that combination specifically was Rossella Tarabini's brief for the collection she designs under her mother's name.</p><p>The reality was thankfully much simpler. The house of Molinari always finds a way to do pretty dresses, whatever the mood of the season. This time, it was ragbag antique glamour with a seventies accent. Close up, the dresses—highly worked amalgams of dévoré velvet, chiffon, and outcrops of sparkly beading—could almost have been the trophies girls boast about finding at Saturday-morning flea markets. Aged and crinkled gold lameés, apparently retrieved after decades in great-granny's attic, reappeared in smocks and tiered skirts tied around the middle with silver sequinned belts.</p><p>Something always comes along to break the suspension of disbelief, of course; here, it was the decidedly contemporary colorways (from chrome yellow through violet and purple) and multiple variations on the theme. But when these drifty, faux-moldered frocks turn up in shops this fall, they're exactly the kinds of things the young Secondhand Roses and would-be Virginias will fall on with gusto.</p></div>"
8,fall,2004,f2004,anna-sui,"One of the things that makes Anna Sui’s show a Fashion Week crowd-pleaser is that she always seems to be having fun. She plays great rock ‘n’ roll, seeds the front row with her groovy friends (Sofia Coppola, Vincent Gallo, the sexily ravaged Psychedelic Furs singer Richard Butler) and gets the best models to sashay down her runway. And whether you take to her retro-boho pastiche sensibility or not, you always walk out smiling.</p><p>For fall, Sui rummaged through the great moments of glitter rock and summoned the ghost of Biba, the legendary late-sixties London boutique, with its stylized forties vibe and clientele of chic, dissolute waifs. She crimped the models’ hair, put them in brightly printed opaque tights and Cuban heels, then sent them out in colorful cardigans paired with flared skirts, suits enlivened by velvet trim, floaty ruffled printed dresses, and lingerie looks like bed jackets and lace-trimmed satin skirts. Restraint? What’s that? There were lamé boots, lamé gloves, lamé jackets, and lamé trim on her boot-cut jeans. She kept the accessories crew busy, loading each look with gold chains, wrapping leopard belts over jackets and coats, and pinning lots of brooches to lapels. It could easily have been discordant, but under Sui’s guidance the result was a burst of much-needed cheerful noise.</p></div>"
9,fall,2004,f2004,as-four,"Call up the As Four studio, and the voice at the other end will answer, “Future Planet of Style.” The flamboyantly avant-garde quartet applied a literal interpretation to that epithet this season, designing their first children’s clothes as part of a presentation they called <em>Ageless</em>. Throughout the show, kids—or, to use their official title, As Children—walked onto the silver stage in petaly getups that were one part Peter Pan whimsy, one part Halloween costume—and completely adorable.</p><p>The proceedings featured all the usual off-the-wall stimuli: a performance by the Icelandic Puppet Company; a soundtrack that mixed a tinkly, music box-like composition by Dan and Ben Brunnemer with clips from Vince Guaraldi’s <em>Charlie Brown</em> theme, Nina Hagen, and Shirley Temple; the antics of As Four’s pit bull, Powder; and the presence of the equally pugnacious Vincent Gallo. But like a children’s book that contains a message for adults, the presentation had depth as well as distraction. Adi, Ange, Gabi, and Kai undertook an inventive, tightly focused reworking of that proper wardrobe staple, Le Smoking. The group’s 13 all-black variations encompassed everything from lace leggings to a metallic-wool sweater to a look named the “Oscardress” that would be viable on the red carpet—and not just on Björk. “The collection,” said Kai after the show, “embodies the idea of what we call elegance—but can’t wear because we can't afford a cleaning lady!”</p></div>"
10,fall,2004,f2004,badgley-mischka,"When Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin sang, “I wanna give you every inch of my love,” he never seemed to have beads, tulle, and satin on his mind. Nonetheless, it was an apt (if remixed) soundtrack choice for Badgley Mischka, who passionately embellished inches—yards, actually—of luxurious fabrics for their fall show.</p><p>The result was a collection of amazing dresses meant for the kind of life that requires, well, lots of amazing dresses. Two semi-sheer tulle pieces, with caviar-size beads clinging to them like a shadow, stood out, as did a more formal evening gown in floor-length satin lamé. Daytime looks included suits and tight, embellished hunting jackets, often in herringbone. Other highlights: a mahogany mink coat with embroidered medallions and a burgundy shearling and mink coat that, despite a whole lotta luxe materials, avoided going over the top. No mean feat.</p></div>"
11,fall,2004,f2004,balenciaga,"Practical urban streetwear—a welcome rarity in these polite ladylike days—made a powerful re-entry into fall as Nicolas Ghesquière showed a slew of the aviator jackets he does so well at Balenciaga. He used them to open his collection, bonding generous curly goat-hair shearling lapels onto cavalry twill and pairing them with a pleated drop-waist pant, with a voluminous leg tapered to the ankle. Casual top, mannish bottom: It made for a loosened-up progression of Balenciaga's signature attractions.</p><p>It got better still when Ghesquière delved, with his usual rigor, into the house archive (""For the first time, I've done it,"" he said) to retrieve Cristobal Balenciaga's gazar balloon skirt. Paired with yet more tiny, nipped-waist flying jackets or his signature shrunken knits, the contrast was unexpected, contemporary, cool. Handling retro in a modern way? That's a rarity, too.</p><p>Still, Ghesquière can never keep himself away from an eighties reference—whether that means a Mugler-esque suit or a filmy nylon windbreaker—and this season he went there again with a few sporty motocross-cum-flying-suit assemblages inspired by a book about early eighties New York graffiti artists. His B-Girls, however, were followed by a pair of short, fluted coat-dresses, one in tweed with scrolled lapels, the other double-breasted, in black. For all their complex construction, they were outstanding examples of drop-dead simple French chic, made relevant for a new generation.</p></div>"
12,fall,2004,f2004,bcbg-max-azria,"After spring’s gently retro collection, Max Azria returned to a harder-edged feeling for fall, showing skinny pants, loose wrapped tops, draped dresses and generous blouson jackets that will help the young and the hip get through next season.</p><p>Although he cited Jean Harlow as an inspiration, Azria’s cuts and colors seemed drawn more from the seventies; what other decade would have dared put a mustardy yellow leather blouson with skinny royal-blue trousers, or a brown top, piped in blue, over red pants tucked into navy boots? The designer breathed some Hollywood glamour into daywear by mixing jewel-toned velvet pieces with sportier opposites like a long, bulky wool scarf or a pair of trousers cut from cotton bengaline. Then it was into the nightlife, where he boogied down with fluttery, skin-baring chiffon dresses and tops worn under slim-cut tuxedos—all guaranteed to win over any reluctant doorman.</p></div>"
13,fall,2004,f2004,behnaz-sarafpour,"Behnaz Sarafpour knows how to set a mood with music. The soundtrack to her brief, sweet fall collection consisted solely of the Jesus and Mary Chain’s <em>Just Like Honey</em>, a hazy, romantic song that’s become inextricably linked to that last scene in <em>Lost in Translation</em>, where Bill Murray murmurs wistfully (and inaudibly) in the ear of Scarlett Johansson.</p><p>Sarafpour seemed in a bittersweet mood herself, having shaken off spring’s aggressive, patent-leather moment. She looked back to the innocence and femininity of the fifties with sunburst pleated skirts, crisp white shirts, and candy-colored cardigans delicately trimmed with ribbon and rosettes. The wide bateau neck on a lovely tweed dress gave the wearer an Audrey Hepburn grace, while a sturdy black wool trench or a brown tweed skirt with a fishtail hem evoked one of those mysterious, vulnerable, and ever-so-chic Hitchcock blondes. When it came to nighttime, however, Sarafpour snapped right back into the present, with slinky satin dresses held together by fragile lace butterflies and sparkly rhinestone collars dropped over T-shirts and satin dresses—very of the moment, and no translation required.</p></div>"
14,fall,2004,f2004,bill-blass,"In his second season as the designer for Bill Blass, Michael Vollbracht showed that he’s resolutely—some might say obstinately—devoted to the house’s heritage as a refuge of elegant sportswear. Emphasis on heritage: Vollbracht’s fall collection was almost a time capsule of Blass circa 1980, shown in a theatrical, dragged-out runway presentation that once again included some of Blass’ former house models, and clocked in at almost 80 looks.</p><p>Vollbracht has said from the start that he’s interested in dressing chic older women, the ones he feels fashion is neglecting. Nonetheless, modern business means appealing to a younger clientele and also catering to Hollywood’s insatiable appetite for glamorous gowns. At times, Vollbracht scored: A light butter-yellow wool crepe suit, or a rust corduroy jacket over a swingy kilt, had timeless cross-generational appeal. Other times, he missed: Too many of the double-faced wool and cashmere fabrics were tailored into long, boxy jackets that harked back to the old power-dressing days. Eveningwear was also a divided affair. A simple black chiffon halter dress with gold spangles creeping up from the hem was as pretty as could be, but a loose silk kimono jacket printed with a giant tiger (designed by Vollbracht, a gifted illustrator) needed to be tamed.</p><p>Vollbracht worked with Blass himself, so his firsthand knowledge of the great designer’s aesthetic can’t be questioned. But if he really wants to do justice to a great legacy, a little less reverence might help.</p></div>"
15,fall,2004,f2004,bottega-veneta,"In the nearly three years since Tomas Maier took over at Bottega Veneta, he's been inching methodically forward—from explaining the intricacies of the house bags and accessories to developing a full-fledged clothing line to go with them. What began as a few luxe sporty sweaters and jackets kept on a rack in the back is now a 60-piece collection, which Maier presented on models clustered on a series of podiums in the company showroom. ""It isn't like normal ready-to-wear,"" Maier explained. ""I had the concept of designing clothes like accessories. Everyone has their own personality, and will pick things out to wear in their own way.""</p><p>Maier's aesthetic is clean and ageless in spirit, with luxury worked in as a result of the extraordinary handcraft that goes into producing exclusive fabrics, prints, and finishes. He used salt-and-pepper baby tweed for coats, tunics, and pants; cashmere for double-layered cardigan coats in beige and chartreuse; and Deco-derived swirly and geometric prints for A-line skirts and drop-waisted dresses. The effect was feminine and modern, but it was still the accessories that kept the audience circling for a closer look. Most want-able are the new bags: a multicolored Mondrian-esque weave, a framed croc in poison green reissued from the sixties, and the chunky, rounded minaudières studded with tiger's-eye.</p></div>"
16,fall,2004,f2004,boudicca,"Boudicca are London's last remaining bastion of subversive design. ""The industry's boring right now,"" Zowie Broach said. ""Fashion has to be about more than just the clothes."" In a phase of standardized commercial showings, audiences welcome anything in the way of drama—always providing the clothes lead fashion somewhere new.</p><p>This season, Boudicca took to the stage of the Mermaid Theatre, creating a patch of moorland turf scored with what looked like chariot tracks, and played the soundtrack to the movie <em>Badlands</em>. Onto this melancholy heath strode a deeply hooded, black-clad figure, to open a collection that mixed sporty, protective clothing with sharp, militaristic coats lashed with narrow leather holsters. Called Hunter-Gatherer, the theme appeared to make some mysterious connection between Queen Boudicca's ancient British Iceni tribe and a modern post-apocalyptic dark age. Barbaric fur collars and heroic asymmetric stoles were slung around coats, interspersed with outfits made of slick, translucent hooded jackets and track pants. Among all this, Brian Kirkby's ace way of wielding the scissors produced the occasional amazingly fitted gored skirt that was beautifully in step with fall. That talent can't be obscured, but as a collection, it felt as if Boudicca had wandered back into a depressive place where few will understand.</p></div>"
17,fall,2004,f2004,burberry-prorsum,"In a Milan season that has seen even the most unlikely fashion houses embrace the concept of eccentricity, via quirky layering and madcap accessorizing, Burberry's Christopher Bailey was no exception. ""Very thirties-inspired,"" said Bailey of his charming show, more ironically ladylike and grown-up than his previous offerings—""a little bit Bloomsbury, but with a light spirit."" Of course, at this storied British company founded by Thomas Burberry in 1856 (and famed for the weatherproof clothes that kept the empire builders dry), Bailey has more claim than most to channel the eclecticism of his generation's It girls—who include the label¿s signature models, Kate Moss and Stella Tennant. (Stella was walking this season¿s runway.)</p><p>That thirties touch meant lingerie-light washed silky dresses in period colors including plum, teal, old rose, bottle green, and slate, and shapely coats with a military edge. And if the fluttering crepe scarves (some in a Schiaparelli-esque glove print), diaphanous cardigans, and swimsuit-backed frocks were surprising for a winter collection, the Burberry girl can keep warm with knitted hats and gloves in bright color accents. The retro palette extended to the hose, which was worn with thick-heeled 1940s lizard court shoes trimmed with crisp little bows.</p><p>But Bailey wasn't just thinking about dressing stiff-upper-lipped heroines like Celia Johnson in the weepy 1945 classic <em>Brief Encounter</em>. To a soundtrack of Status Quo, Elvis Costello, and the Communards, the designer leavened the nostalgia with a series of modern twists. As in seasons past, he played in subtle ways with the house's iconic trench coat—adding epaulets and knotted-leather buttons to skinny corduroy jackets, for instance, or veiling his looks with translucent plastic pieces like an electric-blue Mackintosh and a dramatic scarlet cape. Equally strong were the liquid silver and gold lamé fabrics used for skimpy, make-do-and-mend frocks, and a tiered coat that owed a debt to influential seventies London designers Ossie Clark, Jean Muir, and Bill Gibb—now enjoying a posthumous renaissance.</p></div>"
18,fall,2004,f2004,calvin-klein-collection,"It can’t be easy to take the wheel from a designer whose global name recognition is somewhere up there with Coca-Cola. So, it was understandable that Francisco Costa’s first collection as head of Klein’s women’s line, last spring, was somewhat tentative. Now it’s time for Costa to show that he’s fully in command, and his fall show came up disappointingly short.</p><p>Costa mixed supple, thin fabrics like washed silk, charmeuse, chiffon, gauzy mohair, and cashmere against bulkier wool felt, shearling, and ponyskin, in a typically limited color palette of black, ivory, cream, pinky-brown, steel blue, and peach. He showed flowing silk dresses and mid-calf skirts, slit up the thigh or sliced into awkward flaps along the hem, and loose, hip-length self-belted jackets. There were dramatic black motorcycle-type jackets, cut oversize from ponyskin or felt and worn over fragile underpinnings. Mixed into the outfits were some promising pieces: a short black wool jacket, a black angora and chiffon tank top, a sheer white shirt, some lovely pintucked dresses. But overall, the collection lacked exactly the kind of clean, effortless, coolly pretty clothes that Klein taught the world to want.</p></div>"
19,fall,2004,f2004,carolina-herrera,"Like the jaunty theme song from <em>The Triplets of Belleville</em> that looped through the soundtrack, Carolina Herrera’s fall show had infectious charm to spare. With her design team boosted by creative director Hervé Pierre and her daughter Patricia Lansing, Herrera’s designs have taken a turn for the lighter—always refined and feminine, but with a new sense of color and craft.</p><p>The inspiration for this collection was Europe’s grand ski resorts, but don’t look to Herrera for performance fabrics. This was old-school luxury at its best: buttery cashmere and alpaca, bulky knits and soft leathers in warm wintry colors (brown, deep blue, wine, and black), lavishly embellished with sable, mink, ermine, and fox. She kept it fresh with trim, flirty cuts, like knee-length skirts that flared just below the hips, and such intriguing details as roughed-up edges, cascades of square-edge ruffles, and fabrics stamped with patches of gold leaf.</p><p>Herrera amped things up for evening, creating a series of showstoppers. She dropped a gold fox-fur stole around the neck of a jade-green silk dress; stitched ripped bits of blue chiffon to a gorgeous chocolate gown; crocheted cream-colored cashmere into a ball skirt; and scattered bugle beads across an alpine sweater. The slopes have never looked so inviting.</p></div>"
20,fall,2004,f2004,celine,"So farewell, Michael Kors. In his exit collection for the label he's been designing since 1997, he conjured a straightforward roll call of ladylike personalities to wave good-bye to Paree. That meant, as he spelled out in his program note, ""The sporty American simplicity of C.Z. Guest and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy mixed with the youthful European sophistication of Leslie Caron, Jean Seberg and Audrey Hepburn."" In other words, no surprises, but a lot of luxe double-face camel-hair suits and coats, gray cashmeres, trim Donegal tweed, and <em>jeune fille</em> lace dance dresses.</p><p>Kors leaves Celine as he found it—a bourgeois, conservative French lifestyle label with a reputation for quality. His parting gesture—melding snappy, abbreviated mid-nineties American sportswear with mid-fifties European iconic fashion standards—efficiently summarized the kind of job he has done here. With never a hair or a seam out of place, and always scrupulously attentive to the correct matching of shoe and bag to ensemble, his chignoned ladies advanced in neat-waisted, belted, top-to-toe propriety. Working in a classic palette of beige, brown, gray, and red, Kors made his most ultra-deluxe daytime statements with a short, chocolate crocodile double-breasted jacket, and another in form-fitting astrakhan. For night, he worked the current feeling for fifties circle skirts into romantic, black, strapless lace-covered dance dresses, in honor of Audrey. As Kors took his final bow, he saluted Lawrence Stroll, the backer of his own eponymous New York label. That's where Kors's future now lies; as for Celine, the next chapter remains to be written. A successor to Kors is expected to be announced in the coming weeks.</p></div>"
21,fall,2004,f2004,chalayan,"A midday show under the gilded, chandeliered dome of the Grand Hotel in Paris, scene of so many haute couture presentations of old? You can't get more grown-up than that. To find Hussein Chalayan in these surroundings, rather than in some far-flung, freezing nighttime venue, made some in his audience sit up and do a double take. And so they should, for this choice of locale marked a watershed in the career of a designer who has been quietly moving from the experimental margins to a point of creative maturity. Guess what? Leave meanings and subtexts for a later discussion: First and foremost, Chalayan now wants us to look at his clothes.</p><p>And how wearably, beautifully in sync with the current dialogue about fifties couture/fur trim/pretty dresses those clothes turned out to be. Chalayan opened with a black fake-fur hooded coat, a fur-collared skirtsuit, and a sculptural fur-trimmed cape sitting atop a waisted bodice and a bubble skirt. Right there, without labored references, he nailed his claim to reinterpreting the silhouette, emphasizing a neat torso with gentle volume beneath.</p><p>Chalayan's original mind makes the leap from old world to new by fusing in elements of modern sportswear. He cuts jackets that incorporate trompe l'oeil boleros, horn duffel-coat toggles, baseball jacket-style knit ribbing, and frilled peplums—and still look unfussy. He's also doing his part to ease along the changing shape of trousers with his neat-waisted, wide-leg sailor pants. Chalayan's dusty-pink shearling jackets and coats, cut to a slim, flattering line with luxurious high collars, had more of those little peplums in back. And he ended by proving—to any remaining disbelievers—that he has a sensitive touch with eveningwear. After a few elegantly drapey silk-printed, thirties looks, he closed with short puffball dresses appliquéd with patches of embroidery.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""f1vdb8""></div></div><p>Later, Chalayan said that his show was based on the concept of solitude and personal identity. Perhaps, as an independent, self-financing designer amid a globalized industry, he feels those pressures more than others do. But in this collection, the aloneness of his talent shone with an exceptional brightness.</p></div>"
22,fall,2004,f2004,chanel,"Mercurial and easily bored as he is, Karl Lagerfeld knows exactly how to pick an appropriate Chanel theme—and when to drop it in a flash. For summer, his camellia-fresh pastel suits pinned down the ladylike mood to perfection; but now he's taken another of his 180-degree turns, setting off down the masculine/feminine road. Of course, that's hardly an egregious direction for this house. Coco Chanel went there first, when she purloined the jackets and cardigans of her British lover, Bendor, the Duke of Westminster, in the twenties and thirties. This season showed, for starters, exactly how far Chanel's iconic bouclé can stretch: dainty one moment, tweedy country-boyish the next.</p><p>The opening suits, in mixes of brown, came out matched with newsboy caps in a collection that played fast and loose with Lagerfeld's notions about androgyny, urban streetwear, young dressing, and the old house staples. He literally put his kids on the street—a long asphalt road—and played tricks by sending out pretty boys among the girls. (A man in a Chanel braid-trimmed cardigan jacket: Now that <em>was</em> a first.)</p><p>Lagerfeld stages shows the way he speaks—in a stream-of-consciousness deluge of ideas, references, puns, jokes, and digressions that is often too much for mere mortals to take in. The only way to click onto his crowded information superhighway is to stay calm, look for the big message (jackets and a proposed pant revival), and zero in on the items you'd like to wear. There were plenty of the latter—small jackets in oversized houndstooth tweed, coats in raggedy windowpane check, cute bags in tweed, miniature chain classics in black velvet or green mink, a novelty purse in the shape of a perfume bottle.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""wm9jmp""></div></div><p>Of the many non-tweedy ideas that came down the runway, some looked merely distracting, like an airing of the Chanel skiwear line, while others provided some calm, chic moments amid the melee. Three variations on men's velvet pantsuits (one with a cream lace jabot blouse) touched on a Little Lord Fauntleroy version of cross-dressing. And for those evenings when, frankly, a girl just wants to be a girl, there were a couple of gorgeous black, sequinned, thirties-inspired evening dresses.</p></div>"
23,fall,2004,f2004,cher-michel-klein,"Brave is the designer who decides to show his comeback collection under the stormy skies of an inclement Paris evening. Well, not strictly outside, but in the courtyard of the École des Beaux-Arts' Cour du Mûrier. Even braver is adding a snow machine that generates a storm of artificial sleet over the audience and the models. Perhaps Michel Klein—the hardy soul who made these decisions—felt that he had to come up with a show to remember. In which case, best start with the clothes.</p><p>Klein's collection was representative of a problem that has cropped up more than a few times this week:a few good looks lurking under the weight of a heavy-handed, generally old-fashioned approach to clothes. His shrunken cardigan worn with a full skirt, or a jacket with tattered and frayed mousseline panels on the shoulder, made a convincing case for his return. It's harder to imagine under what circumstances a woman would ever need—or want—a black georgette flared jumpsuit. And if any more evidence of Klein's bravery was needed, then it was his use of scarabs as a decorative leitmotif. They came swarming over an ivory silk kimono or printed onto the back of a Le Smoking, with more crawling up the sides of the pant legs. Creepy-crawly chic: That's one tough sell.</p></div>"
24,fall,2004,f2004,chloe,"Phoebe Philo hit her stride at Chloé with a neat view of how to get around the season's classic themes without ending up in middle-aged Frumpsville. Town-and-country styling, mannish trousers, camel coats, cable knits, conservative blouses, and fifties-femme dresses were all in her collection, but Philo applied a refreshing dash of girl-think to such pressing questions as, Will my butt look big in that?, and, Won't it make me look like Mom?</p><p>She¿d worked out a hip way of handling horsey. A generous camel-hair wrap and a big brown-and-white striped poncho nodded toward their horse-blanket origins without making a big deal of it. With them came the new Chloé pants, an item this young woman always cuts with a scrupulous eye for the crucial back view. Her wide-leg, cuffed trousers achieved the borrowed-from-your-man look while also conspiring to flatter, a point she proved by wearing a pair herself when she appeared at the end of the show.</p><p>What's nice, too, is Philo's knack for breaking up looks with her favorite little tops, like gathered-under-the-bust camisoles. They can lighten up, say, a pair of glen plaid pants or go just as well with everyday jeans. She also managed to navigate blouses, in high-necked cream lace or pin-tucked emerald satin, without making them seem insufferably prim.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""gqnsvk""></div></div><p>True, some of her retro-influenced chiffon dresses couldn't escape the inevitable comparison to Marc Jacobs. But that's true of many collections this season, and it didn't detract from Philo's breezily cool grasp of what young women really want to wear.</p></div>"
25,fall,2004,f2004,christian-dior,"John Galliano has already proved how far he can push it with iconoclastic delirium at Christian Dior. Making over the staid old ""madam"" house to become a global, cash-creating engine for bags, perfume, cosmetics: Done. Faces painted in exaggerated theatrical/clown/kabuki masks: Done. Showing an over-exaggerated version of what will appear in stores? Seen and understood.</p><p>Galliano was up to his old merge-meister devices again for fall. The collection, he explained, was inspired by illustrated <em>Vogue</em> covers from the 1900s, using them as a route through to the Edwardiana/teddy boy revival of the 1950s. What that basically boiled down to was introducing humongous, Poiret-style fur-collared coats into the rockabilly canon of neon leopard spot, vast Elvis-does-Vegas lamé draped jackets, and 4-inch crepe-soled brothel creepers. It was, as usual, taken to the absolute theatrical max—which produced only an exhausted sense of been there, done that.</p><p>There were, among all this, some of the pretty, fragile evening dresses that Galliano confects so well: one in ice blue, sheathed in silver sparkles, another in eau de nil frilled with watery chiffon. Lovely—but these, too, now have the inevitable feel of a design sensibility set to autopilot. Fashion, especially now, needs to be astonished by new approaches to creating beauty for modern times. In the fall 1994 collection that won him his deserved place in the Parisian establishment, a pre-Dior Galliano proved himself prodigiously capable of that with only a few yards of black silk. If he could retrieve his sense of that dreamy simplicity, it would count for more than all the cacophonous entertainment he lays on now.</p></div>"
26,fall,2004,f2004,christian-lacroix,"Christian Lacroix returned to a real runway show this season after taking a 2-year hiatus, and looking at the clothes, it felt as if he'd never been away. Lacroix marches to his own drum, which means that there have been moments when he was been out of step with the rest of the fashion world (during the minimalism of the late nineties, for example). These days, of course, color and ornamentation have become the look du jour; so it should, by rights, be a Lacroix moment.</p><p>If only it were that simple. It's not hard to expect that Lacroix's break from shows, plus his success at Pucci, might have pushed him forward a bit. Yet it felt that things hadn't quite gotten up to speed. He's still just as assured in matters of decoration and color, and his silhouette was much less complicated than in the past. What worked was a plaid trench and blouson, a slim metallic floral coat, and, for evening, an Edwardian-looking lace blouse and floor-sweeping ruffled skirt. But his approach to putting all this together could get a little fussy and overwrought. Sure, odd-looking huge floral corsages are obviously meant just for runway wear, but they still detract from the clothes underneath.</p><p>If Lacroix needs a fresh direction, he could perhaps take a lesson from his own menswear. The few pieces he showed (it's a new venture for him) had all his characteristic richness—the claret velvet blazer with pink-and-khaki-checked tweed trousers or the gray tweed coat worn over a baby-blue hoodie—but worn with a beautifully modern, casual ease.</p></div>"
27,fall,2004,f2004,clements-ribeiro,"Clements Ribeiro has always designed into the eclectic, decorative, nostalgic way of dressing the duo calls ""clunky couture."" Now, with the fashion mood swinging distinctly in its direction, the husband and wife team has come up with a great-looking take on glam eccentricity.</p><p>The first model set the tone, in a scrappy fox shrug, dippy dress patchworked from circus print and polka dots, and a smearing of emerald eye shadow. Part YSL forties collection, part King's Road glamorette, she looked like a vision of the mad, imaginative way young London girls put themselves together in the early seventies. With signature patterned cashmeres, coats in leopard spot or appliquéd with flowers, and a slew of pretty, undone party dresses, it looked like a great way to get that requisite deranged-decadent look for fall. ""I just felt it's time to do something more opulent and gorgeous,"" said Suzanne Clements, who said she and her husband, Inacio Ribeiro, had been inspired by that classic documentary of aristocratic eccentricity, <em>Grey Gardens</em>.</p></div>"
28,fall,2004,f2004,comme-des-garcons,"What was it that made Comme des Garçons' Rei Kawakubo, the leading light of intellectual fashion, decide to show at the Lido, the Parisian nightclub famed for its high-kickin' dancers? As Kawakubo¿s show progressed, no clear answer emerged. What the models wore was certainly a whole lot more substantial than anything that has graced the stage of the Lido in the past: The designer reworked the black jacket, showing it with full leg-o'-mutton sleeves and trimmed with bows and feathers. Some of these jackets were twisted around or looked like they¿d been intricately cut to be worn tied onto the body. In turn, they were partnered with endless variations on a black skirt: some with pleated taffeta bustles, others designed to be worn backward, a few short versions veiled in tulle. Also thrown into the equation were a few pairs of striped, pleated pants that looked like they might have started life as part of a morning suit.</p><p>What was clear was that Kawakubo was on tried-and-tested ground, returning to concepts she has explored in the past: the Victorian and Edwardian eras; the boundaries between masculine and feminine; and the purity of black. Still, those themes didn¿t stop the imagination from running riot, dreaming up little narratives to explain just why she had chosen this venue. Perhaps her muse was some kind of starchy, turn of the century governess who had run off to a life of debauchery and been ravished at the club? That would certainly explain the askew jackets and the smeared red lipstick. When it comes to Kawakubo's clothes, the possibilities are of course endless—which is sometimes how this show felt. There were some truly excellent pieces—the duchesse satin evening coats, in particular—but her showgirls could have gotten the messages across with far fewer turns.</p></div>"
29,fall,2004,f2004,costume-national,"Now, here's a conundrum. You are a designer who has created a highly successful signature that's marked by a way of dressing that's slick and sexy. But fashion is shifting away from that toward more romantic, dreamy, eclectic territory. What do you do? If you are Costume National's Ennio Capasa, you attempt to move to pastures (somewhat) new, by softening up and adding a richer sense of detail and decoration. Capasa's change in direction is also driven by the launch of the label's diffusion line, C'N'C. ""With C'N'C being so casual,"" Capasa said, ""it was really time to make the main collection that much more luxurious and couture-inspired.""</p><p>Did it work? Somewhat. Capasa kept his silhouette close to the body as usual but broke up his usual ultra-minimal look with intricately seamed and paneled chiffon dresses, tight-fit flight jackets with billowing bell sleeves, and fur-collared zippered satin trenchcoats. And he introduced rich jewel tones—ruby, emerald, sapphire—mixing them with the omnipresent black. But mixing brights with black is tricky: Neither ever really comes off looking as good as it could. One longed for Capasa to nix the noir all together and to focus on working his Asian-meets-psychedelic-inspired palette throughout the collection. Sometimes moving on means you really do have to take a leap of faith and break with the past.</p></div>"
30,fall,2004,f2004,d-g,"With almost every designer in the universe referencing vintage these days, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana cut wittily to the chase, showing their D&amp;G line in a faux vintage store. Still, given how young women shop today, acknowledging their flea market competition was as much acknowledging reality as it was putting on a clever show.</p><p>Decade-trawling made easy was the message cheerfully announced on T-shirts that declared ""J'adore le Vintage."" For fall, the D&amp;G racks will be full of excellent rummage finds, starting with Victorian taffeta jackets and moving on through velvet Poiret-esque coats, thirties tea dresses, tweedy Joan Crawford tailoring, Chanel-esque plaids, Courrèges go-go boots, Loris Azzaro gowns, and even a slithery homage to Versace chain mail. Just as impressive, the show's styling was a convincing approximation of how the cool girls really pile all that on, teetering on seventies wedges one moment, funking up chiffon dresses with tracksuits and trainers the next.</p></div>"
31,fall,2004,f2004,daryl-k,"Let all those other thirtysomething New York indie designers rehash the ironic/retro/ladylike thing ad infinitum. Daryl Kerrigan is not about to start pinning rhinestone brooches to her boyfriend jackets; and as for retro, the farthest back she's ever looked was to a Sex Pistols gig at London's 100 Club, circa 1977.</p><p>In her second season after a 2-year hiatus, Kerrigan took a big step toward reclaiming her position as the official dresser of the downtown rock 'n' roll crowd. Like her rocker inspirations, Kerrigan knows short and sharp make the point better than long and laborious, so she kept her presentation trimmed to 16 looks. That served her well, letting the details of her slinky, ruched-and-tucked tops and well-tailored skinny pants shine forth. Of course, Kerrigan's version of punk is hardly thrift store; each rip and slit is artfully placed, and her leather jackets have never seen the back of a tour van. And she wasn't all about tough stuff, either; a few of the season's soft-and-pretty ideas made themselves felt via an abbreviated lingerie slipdress, supersized fur, and even—gasp!—a ribbon bound around a high-waisted velvet dress. Hey, even Sid had his soft side.</p></div>"
32,fall,2004,f2004,derek-lam,"Derek Lam is one of the most promising young talents on the New York scene, a position underscored by the list of partial sponsors for his sophomore runway presentation—Ecco Domani, <em>Vogue,</em> Swarovski, Shiseido, Maurice Villency, and Saga Furs each contributed to the cost of the show, in the august confines of New York’s National Arts Club. The investment turned out to be a sound one. Lam’s 24-piece collection displayed the attitude, exuberance, and craftsmanship of a much more experienced designer (which shouldn’t be that surprising, given the fact that he spent 12 years working for Michael Kors).</p><p>Lam’s fall mood was part Viennese formality, part Gypsy ease, and his strength as a mixologist came through in some superb pairings: luxurious cashmere boyfriend sweaters with shiny jacquard dresses, or a striped mink scarf worn with lamé brocade pajama shorts. The designer reprised the softly structured strapless dresses he had shown for spring, rendering them in glittery fabrics with jeweled embellishments, and balanced comfort and opulence in a floral-print vintage-silk georgette dress that flowed with every step. He also introduced softer, longer tea gowns and Empire-waisted peasant dresses. The final evening gowns were stunners that lifted even the Some Girls lyrics on the soundtrack—“You’re the prettiest girl in the world”—out of the realm of irony or cliché. Lam’s collection was relevant, contemporary, and genuinely very pretty, indeed.</p></div>"
33,fall,2004,f2004,diane-von-furstenberg,"The peripatetic Diane von Furstenberg never stays in one place, or one decade, too long. For spring, she flirted with flappers, but her fall collection was dedicated to a less era-specific icon: the glamazon (which also happens to be the name of the newest addition to her growing beauty line).</p><p>This modern-day huntress gathers her fashion as she pleases; not for her a dull adherence to one style or another. The collection, designed as always by von Furstenberg and Nathan Jenden, drew heavily from the English hunting lodge, with its tweeds and tartans—although it’s doubtful anyone ever rode to the hounds in one of von Furstenberg’s skintight cuts, curvy jackets, or eye-dazzling color combinations. The designers called on Camelot as well, with touches of medieval battle armor: a metallic knit tunic with an attached hood, a dark-gray snakeskin leather jacket, a jangly spangled beaded tabard worn over a wool jersey top and leggings. There’s so much going on that it can be hard to follow von Furstenberg’s lead, but there’s no doubt she enjoys the sport of it all.</p></div>"
34,fall,2004,f2004,dkny,"Secondary collections sometimes suffer from neglected-sibling treatment, making do with hand-me-down rejects from their bigger sisters. Thankfully, Donna Karan avoids that approach with DKNY, giving the label a personality (smart, snappy, a little bit trendy) all its own.</p><p>Fall's collection was one of DKNY's best yet, full of right-on colors, fabrics and proportions. The palette was classic fall—greens, browns and plums in tones that ranged from acid bright to muted—all the better to back up the collegiate-bohemian vibe. The show opened with a generously cut tweedy overcoat worn over a body-skimming kneelength jersey dress, and followed up with lots of examples of the new trouser shape—narrow, cropped just above the ankle and worn with bulky boots or chunky heeled pumps. There were cozy, bulky sweaters that sat on the hips, A-line skirts made from bias-cut strips of fabric or sunburst-pleated for a swingy flare, crisp boxy jackets and fragile chiffon dresses, pintucked and pleated to a fare-thee-well. The only points of crossover with Karan's signature line were the soft, wrinkly leathers she used in her spring collection, but they were welcome additions to the party.</p><p>She may cherish her own identity, but the DKNY girl is happy to raid mom's jewelry box for a big glittery brooch, or grandma's closet for a swinging, three-quarter sleeve coat that she'll wear over tweed trousers or a silky jersey dress. When it comes to nighttime, however, she's strictly modern, heading out the door in a a skin-baring, jewel-toned satin slipdress. Don't ask what time she'll be home.</p></div>"
35,fall,2004,f2004,dolce-gabbana,"After last season's print-on-print delirium, this collection—an ode to the iconic images of the late, very great photographer Helmut Newton—was a remarkably sober offering from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But in the hands of Domenico and Stefano, of course, sobriety is a relative concept; there was no shortage of razzle-dazzle and built-in wardrobe malfunction.</p><p>Like Newton in the seventies and eighties, the boys presented a woman who was ultra-chic, groomed, powerful—and ripe for sexual misadventure. Small wonder that pride of place in the audience was reserved for Fanny Ardant, the agelessly beautiful French actress and sometime Newton subject, striking in the designers' shapely white pencil-skirt power suit. Or that the amazonian Nadja Auermann, another Newton favorite, strode the runway, more svelte and dramatic than ever.</p><p>Many of Newton's strongest pictures from this period feature the clothes of Saint Laurent (that's Yves, not Tom, for those with fashion-history deficit disorder), and there were several explicit, if playful, homages to that Parisian master—from the deep-green boxy fox chubby to the prim-but-sexy chiffon-and-lace full-sleeved cocktail frocks to an evening parade of skinny satin or velvet tuxedo pantsuits with a flash of lacy camisole beneath. Perhaps—prior to any official pronouncement about Tom Ford's replacement chez Saint Laurent—Messrs. Dolce and Gabbana are auditioning for the role?</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""kzejp""></div></div><p>In the meantime, they are having plenty of fun in Milan, subverting old-fashioned elegance with their own brand of highly sexed style. Even in a season of luxe effects, their fox-cuffed short evening coat, solid with diamond and topaz crystal beading and fit for a latter-day Marlene Dietrich, was eye-poppingly glamorous. Inventive notions included simply chic sweaters and satin shell tops garlanded with trompe l'oeil embroidered necklaces, houndstooth skirts inset with godets of naughty black lace, and a formal black coat that flashed open to reveal a lingerie slip beneath. As the girls—including Elvis' angelic granddaughter Riley Keough, in demure black velvet—clustered on the orchid-pink leatherette banquettes of the Regine's-inspired disco set, one model sped past in a high-neck, long-sleeve black lace gown that looked conservative enough for Mrs. Bush. Until she turned her back, revealing the sheer, unlined lace back that flashed an emerald-green bra and panty set. Perfect for the next Super Bowl.</p></div>"
36,fall,2004,f2004,donna-karan,"A black cashmere bodysuit shown against a backdrop of the New York City skyline by night. That’s how Donna Karan opened her fall show, drawing a direct line from her first collection, 20 years ago, right up to the present. That scrap of jersey kick-started Karan’s empire and changed the way women thought about power dressing, while the energy of the city was refracted in her thoroughly modern clothes. Two decades later, she’s still guided by the same twin stars.</p><p>The designer replaced the heated sensuality of her spring collection with a moody remoteness, reinforced by the sober palette: plum, brown, rust, ocher yellow, and chartreuse. She played that out in soft cashmere and wool jerseys, silk tulle, burnt-out velvets, and wool bouclé, often topped with little twisted fur neckpieces. Snug jersey dresses were inventively wrapped and frequently anchored by glass buckles courtesy of jeweler William Morris. Karan’s sportswear, as always, looked light enough to float, while the raw seams and rugged leathers added a gloss of dark charm. Evening dresses incorporating suede, cashmere, and velvet seemed more suited to a salon than a soirée, but Karan’s gold-sequin and tulle gown could light up the night all by itself.</p></div>"
37,fall,2004,f2004,dries-van-noten,"Dries Van Noten could never see a woman as a power vixen or a sex bomb. His natural affections have always tended toward the eclectic, eccentric, intellectual type whose mind has been broadened by travel. This woman likes gentle, layered, softly colored, unrestricting clothes, and—Van Noten has discovered—she has a surprising eye for the odd, richly sparkling accessory or two. She is, in fact, his customer, so it's hardly surprising to find the designer staying true to the arts-and-crafts, twenties-thirties sensibility that just so happens to be sweeping fashion right now.</p><p>This season, she is personified as a poetry-reading Bloomsbury aesthete with a passion for chinoiserie. She lives in dusty, washed-out colors—mushroom, plaster pink, aged greens—made up into loose twenties blouses, block-patterned jacquard coats, and tweedy cardigan knits. She has traveled, probably by air (which maybe accounts for her eccentric insistence on wearing Red Baron-esque leather flying trews). One of her adventures clearly took her to Somerset Maugham's Singapore, for she has returned with embroidered silk pajamas and richly embellished Chinese jackets as souvenirs. For afternoons in her study (writing her memoirs in purple ink, no doubt), she sits comfortably in silken dévoré-velvet kimonos to summon the muse.</p><p>But that's enough of that. What practical fashion fiends will note from this collection is Van Noten's way with a great decorative scarf—an accessory category he has made almost his own. For fall, it's transformed into a little fur neck-collar with a jewel-encrusted placket—an instant must-have, even if you're not a paid-up member of the eternal Van Noten sisterhood.</p></div>"
38,fall,2004,f2004,dsquared,"<em>The Simple Life</em>, Season 2: Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie in Calgary. If that pitch flies in Hollywood, Dsquared has the wardrobe prepped and ready to go. For their fall collection, the irrepressible Caten twins took Canada—their home and native land—and its icons as the starting point for a kitschy meander through rugged winterwear.</p><p>The theme was introduced by a matched set of brawny, red-jacketed Mounties and developed by the parade of woodsy, lumberjack-flavored pieces that followed—bulky wools in windowpane plaids, plush fox-fur-trimmed coats, lots of little sweaters. In fact, when in doubt, the Catens miniaturize, creating shrunken jackets, plaid kilts that elsewhere would be called belts, and variations on their famously very low-slung pants (this season cropped at midcalf and worn with high-heel work boots). It was cute, cheerful, and wholesomely trashy, if a little far from both the sweetly feminine and luxe bohemian looks that are filling other runways. Then again, the Caten brothers have never followed anyone's map but their own.</p></div>"
39,fall,2004,f2004,emanuel-ungaro,"There are times when a show is in progress and, suddenly, a question crops up: Just exactly which season are these clothes for? That particular thought crossed the mind while watching Giambattista Valli's latest efforts for the house of Ungaro. Valli, rather guilty in the past of loading his outfits with too many extras (fedoras and fur wraps and feathery fripperies), stripped back to nothing this season but for some fabulous Buccellati earrings and the occasional gem-studded satin bag.</p><p>But perhaps this stripping process went too far. What Valli showed on the runway flashed enough flesh to make even a spring collection seem skimpy, yet these looks are meant for fall. When the weather turns chilly, is a woman really going to reach for a tiered floral silk mini or a nude beaded chiffon dress? It's hypothermia on a hanger—not to mention out of sync with where fashion is now. As the recent Academy Awards made clear, blatant skin-baring is out, and seduction is turning more subtle. If Valli's efforts to simplify what he shows had included more of those curvy tweed jackets and leopard-print wrap coats that did make it onto the runway, he might have given this collection greater substance—in every sense of the word.</p></div>"
40,fall,2004,f2004,emilio-pucci,"Christian Lacroix relaxed into his element at Pucci for fall—meaning there was more of his signature, slightly wacky styling on show. That¿s a plus in a season when colorful, offbeat eclecticism is the flavor of the moment, and even more so given Lacroix¿s practiced skill with color and complex, floaty asymmetries destined for the party circuit.</p><p>To start, Lacroix veered off piste from Pucci¿s St. Moritz ski heritage, choosing instead to stick to city tweeds and sweaters. He Puccified those herringbone coats, neat jackets, and knickers by printing them with an adaptation of a late-sixties/early seventies archive design called Moire. The mix of fox-fur collars, suede platforms, and trilbies made for combinations few might copy verbatim, but that¿s OK. Modern shoppers trawl Pucci to cherry-pick items, and Lacroix laid on plenty of quirky amusements, from multi-patterned sweaters to odd, bright psychedelic hats to oversized satin totes.</p><p>Still, Lacroix seemed happiest when he lightened his palette and moved into evening. Adding silver Lurex to the pink, green, and turquoise prints, knotting flyaway scarf details, and applying spiderweb crochet, he made fragile little dresses that will be life-enhancing additions to winter¿s dark nights.</p></div>"
41,fall,2004,f2004,emporio-armani,"With a video of skyscrapers flickering behind them, Giorgio Armani's new Emporio women marched out. They're a far cry from his serious, be-suited, go-to-work army of old, though; they may be business types, but they're still in the mood to face the day feeling, well, considerably foxier than the average straight-laced corporate recruit.</p><p>Crimped hair, dangly earrings, and high heels were the ever-so-slightly trashy foil for Armani's signature softly-tailored coats, rounded in the shoulder and flared at the hem. Biker jackets in pony and mid-calf flippy skirts replaced his more familiar office-proper suitings. As the collection headed toward evening, a Spanish Gypsy element cropped up in head scarves and heavy tasselled fringe on stoles and knits. The show ended with a burst of song from a young woman performer, Yu Yu—a lead-in to the music-business party Armani was to throw later that evening at his nightclub. Though some of the design specifics of the collection didn't gel, Armani's message was clear: He's in a mood to lighten up and let his women look as if they want to live a little.</p></div>"
42,fall,2004,f2004,fendi,"Sitting in a freezing, inhospitable industrial space waiting for the Fendi show to begin, the huddled, goose-pimpled audience was craving a major fur moment in more ways than one. When Karl Lagerfeld's slick-haired futuristic amazons began to stalk out, bristling with armfuls of metal jewellery, the knitted furs they dragged behind them did have an enviable survival-blanket appeal. But these surprisingly restrained offerings were hardly the kind of explosively creative pieces expected from the house that rewrote the rule book on skins and pelts.</p><p>There were no obvious references for the tight, sometimes hobbling silhouettes and aggressively hard-edged look Lagerfeld created (except, perhaps, for a touch of the sci-fi movie <em>Gattaca</em>). His army of women teetered the 100-yard runway in round-toed wedges, brandishing the new Fendi bags like totems (one with a shiny metal handle reminiscent of a transistor radio's, another a jewelled and mirrored minaudière). To be fair, Lagerfeld should get some credit for taking an anti-vintage stance this season—somebody had to do it, after all. ""It was not about any past,"" he declared. ""Certainly not my own."" That said, his drive to modernism had a dispiriting joylessness about it. Luxe fashion like Fendi's, which speaks in the details of incredible craftsmanship, doesn't necessarily shine in such cold and impersonal surroundings.</p></div>"
43,fall,2004,f2004,giles-deacon,"Giles Deacon had the confidence to harness the best of British spirit with relish and wit. In his debut collection, called Giles, he managed to marry a slightly peculiar, uptight-seventies-lady look—all nipped-waist suits, pussycat-bow blouses, and flowing printed gowns—with homegrown English craft. Deacon, 34, graduated from Central St. Martin's ten years ago with Hussein Chalayan and has spent the intervening years freelancing, with stints at Bottega Veneta and Gucci. So why choose London as a launchpad? ""I live here. I love it,"" he said. ""There's such a lot going on here if you dig around.""</p><p>Deacon's international experience shows in the polish of his silhouettes—and in the roster of supermodels (Nadja Auermann and Eva Herzigova among them) who wore his precision-cut wide-shouldered jackets, pencil skirts, cashmere tank tops, and fan-pleated skirts. That, plus the deliberately chosen materials—hand-loomed bespoke jacquards, custom-made psychedelic woodland prints commissioned from the Glasgow School of Art, luxe Linton tweed from Scotland, and leather accessories, molded into the shape of stag beetles by artist-craftsman Justin Capp—gave the show what Deacon calls ""a slightly odd, misplaced chicness."" With its underlying thread of perversity (covered-up dresses that showed intriguing flashes of garter and seamed stockings) and just a hint of trippiness offsetting the very sensible, Deacon's collection put down a marker for a new English look.</p></div>"
44,fall,2004,f2004,giorgio-armani,"Giorgio Armani has a new focus. ""Women want to be diverse, not to follow a standardized look,"" he said of his fall show. ""They want to be motivated by something special. That's why they've started looking for vintage pieces."" Inspired by what he called ""a vague feeling for the 1900s, and Visconti's film <em>The Damned</em>,"" he sent out a romantic assembly of looks designed to be remixed by the wearer, rather than imposed as top-to-toe solutions.</p><p>Armani drew a long, supple silhouette with dresses, coats, and jackets that were cut close to the body and gently fluted toward the hem. Standouts included laser-cut and printed velvet pieces, scalloped-edge lace jackets, beaded halter dresses, and crystal-encrusted evening jackets crafted as softly as blouses. Huge sparkling brooches underscored the air of decadent eccentricity that is fast becoming the look of the season. Among the rich, couturelike handwork that has long distinguished Armani's evening looks, he also sent out a selection of his luxurious signature streetwear in the form of ankle-skimming, vaguely Napoleonic coats.</p><p>In condensing this show to a 20-minute sampling of his vast collection, Armani embraced the eclecticism that is a ruling factor in fashion right now. It looked like a beautiful step forward.</p></div>"
45,fall,2004,f2004,givenchy,"The time has come to bid adieu to Julien Macdonald, who leaves Givenchy after three years. Macdonald has not had the easiest of times in Paris. His natural inclination, as demonstrated by his eponymous London-based label, is toward a spangly, none too subtle glamour that would satisfy even the most blatantly exhibitionist starlet. Macdonald spent his time at Givenchy desperately trying to free himself from its history, dominated by the understated chic that its founder created for Audrey Hepburn in the fifties: little black dresses that tapered toward the knees, cropped-sleeve coats that shrugged over straight skirts, and sweet but sober evening dresses with one indulgence: a strapless neckline, say, or a judiciously placed bow.</p><p>Having resisted the pull of the past this long, Macdonald finally gave in and used the house's roots as inspiration for his last big blowout at Givenchy. The problem was that none of it really worked. His mix of voluminous furs, belted coats over billowing pouf skirts, and fitted cocktail dresses with frothy lingerie flourishes has already been seen elsewhere this week—and in much more convincing forms. Still, if there's anything positive about all of this, it's that Macdonald is happy to be free to concentrate on his own label. That's if the size of his smile as he took the runway at the show's finale is anything to go by.</p></div>"
46,fall,2004,f2004,gucci,"The emotional ending of the Tom Ford era at Gucci was a look back in glamour—a fabulous farewell in which this perfection-obsessed superstar of fashion seized the moment to run his eye over everything he has achieved for the brand, and then do it better. There is no doubt who the Gucci woman is: the embodiment of sexual confidence, burnished to a high gloss and bursting with predatory power. A symbolic figure of the past decade's hedonistic highs, she spike-heeled her way down a runway carpeted with pink fur, luxuriating in Ford's aesthetic one last time.</p><p>And it has become elaborate of late. Even when he cuts a mean-looking black skirtsuit, it will be fanatically worked to the body, ruched to the ribs, and pieced in multiple complex slivers to grip the derriere. So too with the jackets, which have become ultra-decadent amalgams of dyed fox, croc, and suede, cut to emphasize a big shoulder and clinch the torso in bursts of sunray patchwork.</p><p>The buildup began as Ford took his audience through a knowing, celebratory series of flashbacks. There were the blue velvet jackets of his first 1995 hit, paired with nude beaded pants from a later blockbuster. A new manifestation of the 1999 sellout white coat with a knotted leather belt, its glamour amped to overload with an entire white fox snaking the shoulders. Variations on the crystal-sprinkled flesh-colored goddess gown famously worn by Nicole Kidman at the Met, even more beautifully realized than the original.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""m21yq7""></div></div><p>Ford outdid himself as well with event-making eveningwear. There were slithering sequined mermaid gowns, the ultimate done in a fantastically evil shade of green and wrapped in an arrogant fox-and-chiffon stole. But the emotional crescendo came from the white cutout jersey dresses that closed the show. A reprise of Ford's favorite collection of fall '96, they came more softly draped and subtly constructed than the originals. He bestowed the best on Georgina Grenville, making a nostalgic comeback appearance in her role as the ultimate high-nineties Gucci model. She looked overwhelmed at the thunderous applause that accompanied her final walk, the perfect signoff to the extraordinary drama of Ford's years at Gucci.</p></div>"
47,fall,2004,f2004,helmut-lang,"The long-limbed stride of Helmut Lang's tribe is a uniquely confident forward march. From their elegant coats to the tips of their high stalking heels, his women go out to meet the real world with a conviction that leaves retro in the dust. For starters, theyre prepared for the weather (a consideration strangely overlooked in many of this season's lady-crazed collections). His deep-dyed shearlings in saturated blues and purples, some chopped short into multi-flapped shrugs, others cut as lean raw-edged coats, made an instant, powerful impact. Pragmatism with a personal, cultured background: Now, thats a beautiful sight in these days of skimpy fashion thinking.</p><p>Lang didnt neglect to show that other item that's scarce on the ground this season: a mean-cut pair of the great skinny tux pants hes always done, now narrowed to meet high-cuffed drawstring suede or shearling ankle boots. If it's the perfect black trouser suit youre desperate for, hes your only man. And once daytime is dealt with, he has some of the most coolly brilliant options for evening, too—like a gorgeous, just-off-classic white satin trench and a shaggy cream goat-shearling coat belted with white satin. As sophisticated as these pieces are, they have an easy wearability that lifted this collection clear of the shredded, strap-manic complexity of some of Langs recent work.</p><p>When you buy into Lang's aesthetic, however, you're also complicit with his subtly coded subtexts. That could be the white lace edge on the brim of a thigh-high leather boot, under a short black dress with a suggestive frill of white petticoat. ""Sort of a bit like an Austrian waitress, no?"" the designer laughed, afterward. Langs Mittel European roots also account for the pleated organza twisted onto evening gowns—from Hungarian folk costume, he said, just as the shaggy cream coat started life as a notion about Hungarian shepherd jackets. But none of these references were overt. Lang is too mature, and too sure of his touch, to resort to a one-note ""inspiration,"" and this collection was as far from ""folkloric"" as imaginable. With its small details of delightfully irrational crazy-chic—like the pony-hair tail sprouting from the back of a pair of pumps—it qualified as a modernist high point of the season.</p></div>"
48,fall,2004,f2004,hermes,"Jean Paul Gaultier is the new designer in the Hermès stable—literally. He showed his debut collection for the ultimate French haute-horsey leather-goods house at the École Militaire cavalry training ground, where the audience sat on bales of hay, under crystal chandeliers. Now, in a serendipitous turn, equestrian just happens to have been trotted out as a trend this fall. So, in a happy case of Gaultier-esque double-think, he barely needed to give Hermès a fashion leg-up to make it sit easily with the season. And because Hermès is haughtily blinkered to ""fashion,"" anyway, this collection was set to keep everyone in the audience—from thoroughbred traditionalists to nervy trend-jockeys—smiling.</p><p>An elegant top-hatted riding habit opened the show, followed by a couple of suede ""jodhpur"" skirts that curved into the knee—an amusing acknowledgement of the bubble-skirt shape that's been turning up elsewhere. From there, Gaultier played on all the house classics—discreet gray cashmere cardigans(with detachable fur collars), the distinctive Hermès orange canvas (as a sporty jacket), navy pea coats (with the proportions chicly exaggerated), and luxe fringed scarves (draped to become coats).</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>He also made a typically witty JPG transposition by taking the iconic brass hardware of the Hermès handbag and using it as fastenings on a camel toggle coat, as details on gloves and boots, and even as padlocked chokers on leather-trimmed halter dresses. Persuading Lou Doillon to walk in a leather jacket, pants, and riding boots, swishing a crop, was another excellent twist on Hermès culture (because, of course, as the daughter of Jane Birkin, the girlis dynastically related to that iconic bag). Speaking of which—the Birkin turned up remodelled in an elongated version that is certain to make the legendary Hermès waiting lists even longer.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""vg31gv""></div></div><p>There were moments in this collection when Gaultier's penchant for perversity made a discreet appearance among the bourgeois classics. For the sharp-eyed, the harness head-straps made a sly reference to the notorious <em>Paris Vogue</em> shoot by Helmut Newton that depicted an unusual deployment of Hermès saddlery in a hotel bedroom. For the most part, though, there was nothing to frighten the horses in this collection. Quality and conservatism won out, which is probably just as it should be, for the time being. How Gaultier sustains the interest over the coming seasons will be something to watch.</p></div>"
49,fall,2004,f2004,imitation-of-christ,"Tara Subkoff is a new woman. In an about-face from her retro-inspired spring collection, which celebrated the glamour of Old Hollywood, the designer presented a vintage-free fall knitwear collection to an artist-heavy crowd packed into the small 94th Street salon of independent curator Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn. A decent portion of the audience had actually had a hand in the production: Paula Hayes’s <em>Forest</em> installation formed the backdrop, while Rita Ackermann helped paint the meandering paper runway, strewn with white roses and magnolia leaves. Also in attendance were Jimmy Fallon, Sam Taylor-Wood, and a gaggle of under-fives that included Mingus Reedus, whose saucer-sized blue eyes followed his mom, Helena Christensen, as she walked.</p><p>Subkoff’s theme was a kind of extreme take on the strong woman: half goddess (but not of the drapey sort), half Amazon. That translated into microscopically short, body-loving knits, mostly rendered in black, white, and metallics, accessorized with Erickson Beamon cuff bracelets and knee-high gold Puma boots. This was a tightly focused show that marked a departure from Imitation of Christ’s established brand image. Though reworked vintage will continue to be available by special order, Subkoff, for now, seems focused on her own original designs. This takes her out of an increasingly crowded niche, but how well she can fare in a bigger, more competitive arena remains to be seen.</p></div>"
50,fall,2004,f2004,j-mendel,"Gilles Mendel, the third-generation designer behind the beloved-of-socialites furrier J. Mendel, is a wizard with a pelt. That’s why his sporty designs are filling the closets of women who wouldn’t give mom’s mink a second look. In the past few seasons, Mendel has been adding in bits and pieces of made-to-order clothing to his seasonal presentations; for fall, he went all-out with a fashion show in the Bryant Park tents.</p><p>Mendel drew his inspiration from Anna Karenina, Tolstoy’s sensually beautiful, irresistible heroine. And there were certainly clothes fit for a czarina: figure-hugging silk dresses in pale colors, trimmed with dangling knotted cords; soft crinkly chiffon skirts that swirled around the knees; and tulle skirts that burst in pleats, all decked with plenty of Cartier diamonds. Mendel worked fur throughout, cutting flawlessly constructed lightweight coats and jackets from sheared mink and broadtail and putting fluffy fox shrugs over satin gowns. He even made a dramatic black dress from feathers and strips of mink; it was old-world luxe with a hip new attitude.</p></div>"
51,fall,2004,f2004,jean-paul-gaultier,"Remember those heady days of the very early nineties, when the supermodel reigned supreme? And how some designers were up in arms about how much it cost to get them out of bed? Well, if only they'd stumbled on the stunt that Jean Paul Gaultier dreamed up for his show: Dispense with the latter-day supes, the Darias and the Liyas and the Karolinas, and use marionettes instead. (Oh, and a few model friends whom you have turned to time and again to walk your runway.) Working from a gantry erected onto the catwalk, Gaultier's puppeteers twirled their subjects round, even getting them to strike a few couture-y poses. But once the novelty wore off, did these puppets really make for an adequate substitute? The best runway-strutters project the same kind of allure radiated by Gaultier's guest Catherine Deneuve. Balsa tends to run a very poor second.</p><p>More importantly, did the clothes tug at the heartstrings of the audience? It was inevitable that they would a little, given that they represented Gaultier's homage to his own greatest hits. In a season where coats and jackets are shaping up to be more desirable than they have been in years, the designer's canny, commercial collection featured some of the best from his past, which looked just as good now. Standouts? A heavy herringbone tweed coat swathed in fox fur; a swingy, drop-shouldered navy caban; and an aviator jacket that mixed up a few of Gaultier's favorite things—tough distressed leather, Aran knitwear, corset lacing. And if these looks worked on life-size puppets, just think what they'll do when they make it onto real women.</p></div>"
52,fall,2004,f2004,jeffrey-chow,"The second time out is always harder than the debut; there’s more attention, higher expectations, greater pressure to impress. In a short and sweet fall collection, Jeffrey Chow (one of this year’s Ecco Domani winners) managed to avoid most of the sophomore pitfalls, while further establishing his distinctive take on luxe sportswear.</p><p>Chow showed lots of classic tailoring in traditional fabrics: loose-fitting tweed jackets, gathered at the back into a high-waisted ruffle; flannel trousers cut both wide and skinny, with a slightly raised waist; slim herringbone pencil skirts. His tunic-length hand-knit cabled sweaters, worn over slim bronze pants or some of his soft dresses, mixed well with the boho-preppy feeling that’s running through many of the young-designer shows this week. And his structured satin dresses, paired with fur jackets and capes, had the charm of a debutante’s ball. Chow spent a bit too much time fussing with some of his jackets—inserting various fabrics in the sleeves or adding extraneous embroidery—but overall he showed long-term potential. This is a young designer to watch.</p></div>"
53,fall,2004,f2004,jil-sander,"Clearly refreshed by the 3-year hiatus that ended with her spring 2004 collection, Jil Sander delivered a fall show that cut through the mixed-up flavors of current fashion like a palate-cleansing sorbet. Her new contribution is a gentler, less conceptual approach that embraces the desire for prettiness as well as coolly cut streetwear.</p><p>Sander offered a confident, contemporary parallel to mainstream fashion's current ladylike agenda, showing amazingly cut pea jackets, lean pants, tweed princess coats, and A-line skirts. The effect was simple and sophisticated, thanks as always to the judicious manipulation of quietly luxurious fabric. Sander's customers have always trusted her to dispel the nightmare complications of getting dressed for a busy day and now they have an equally happy one-step solution for great eveningwear: Put on her strapless, understated cream dress and—sans jewellery, furs, accessories, or fuss—you will turn heads like a modern-day Audrey Hepburn in a room full of gussied-up matrons.</p><p>Sander's comeback is proving the true value of personal, meticulously evolved design skills to the integrity of a brand. There is a clear difference between what we see now (the infinite care taken to mold the seaming and frame the stand of a collar in a herringbone tweed coat, for instance) and the generalized merchandising drive that prevailed in her absence. There's nothing intellectual about it, either: Countless women will relate to the easy simplicity of pairing a sweater with a black fan-pleated skirt, with a flash of silver in the front, or running off to work in a neat white half-belted trench. Sander's loyal customers are already back in droves: With this collection they're likely to be joined by a younger generation, shopping shoulder to shoulder.</p></div>"
54,fall,2004,f2004,jill-stuart,"Jill Stuart seems to have found a show format she's comfortable with and she stuck with it for fall, opening—as she did last season—with a well-tailored coat and closing with a bias-cut gown. Spring's emphasis on lingerie gave way to a lot of tweed, as well as a series of riding-style looks—tight jackets with a Victorian-Russian flavor, worn with cigarette-slim pants. Among the designer's signature vintage-inspired looks were a multitude of pretty dresses, like a tiered, silver lace piece worn by Luca Gadjus and several delicate chiffon dresses beaded in a simple starburst pattern.</p></div>"
55,fall,2004,f2004,john-galliano,"John Galliano cited ""romantic, poetic seafarers of the Yemeni tribe"" as the basis of his fall collection. Quite what they were doing tangled up with gigantic <em>Cold Mountain</em> crinolines and corsets exploding with ruffles we needn't question too closely; all this means is that we're off on another colorful trip into Galliano's psychedelic, ethnographic imagination.</p><p>The pileup of fun and spectacle started with the towering constructs on the girls' heads. Little bowlers teetered on top of arrangements that supported, variously, floral head scarves, huge coiled fake-hair plaits, fox tails, silver jewelery, and whole canteens of miniature pots and pans. All <em>that</em> mirrored what was going on in the clothes—an insane collision of piratical stripes, vivid gypsy florals, Galliano's signature newsprint chiffons, and knitted patchworks, accessorized with dangling Coke cans and empty plastic mineral-water bottles.</p><p>Galliano¿s shows make a mockery of solemn fashion reporting. He knows, and we know, that no one would ever wear a 12-foot-wide crinoline over a baggy pair of printed drawers with, perhaps, a pair of plastic carrier bags on the feet. He's not even suggesting it. Perhaps what he's saying with this crazy scavenger look is that most canny shoppers simply pick over current fashion to appropriate what they want to add to a lifetime's collection of personal treasures. He is not one to laboriously dictate what goes with what.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""ag8ikn""></div></div><p>At any rate, this time, the visual mayhem didn't conceal the garments that will translate directly from runway to hanger. Tiny, form-fitting jackets were the news, some in rose-embroidered chamois leather, others cut as bugle-boy military spencers or as eighteenth-century corsets in shearling. Great knits were also nonchalantly thrown in—a cream cardigan with fluffy pom-poms here, a raspberry-striped long-sleeve polo shirt there. All that seemed missing from Galliano¿s regular menu were his fragile evening dresses, one of the foundations on which he has built his name.</p><p>One thing is certain: For all the provocation Galliano likes his presentations to stir up, the real surprise is how scrumptiously pretty it ends up looking in the store.</p></div>"
56,fall,2004,f2004,jonathan-saunders,"The kaleidoscope of British talent periodically shakes out brilliant print designers who can look at color and pattern in mind-bending new ways. The latest is Scottish-born Jonathan Saunders, so skilled in manipulating surface design that he engineers his patterns to flow over body contours.</p><p>Using hard-edged combinations of orange, gray, ochre, purple, black and white, his sharp-angled geometrics are interspersed with zig-zagging zones of herringbone pattern—like Art Deco processed by a cyber-brain. Saunders applied his patterns to a troupe of second-skin dresses and bodysuits that looked like a muted, psychedelic echo of the days of Thierry Mugler's glamazons. There was too much repetition, but the glam-rock mood was on target with a growing London trend.</p></div>"
57,fall,2004,f2004,junya-watanabe,"Perhaps only Junya Watanabe (or his mentor, Rei Kawakubo) could cut an Edwardian gown out of what looks like a black nylon sleeping bag—and call it ""classic."" But if you're tuned in to Watanabe's romantic, avant-garde wavelength, with prior knowledge of his body of work, the idea actually made a kind of sense— eventually. During the show, his deeply padded stole necklines evolved into Poiret-like wraps and then on into sweet renditions of utilitarian, down-filled jackets. Classic couture meets classic streetwear, if you will.</p><p>Watanabe also revisited his favorite personal classics—the tweed and denim he's worked to stellar effect in the past. He used micro-tweed in jackets with tiny accordion pleats circling sleeves and waist, and took the padding theme to the insides of a forties-style, turquoise and brown Donegal skirtsuit. His signature aged denims came cut into low-riding skirts and as a great pair of loose-fit jeans. Watanabe also developed this season's cape obsession, turning it into a fine layer of knitted lace, like a sophisticated version of a bed-jacket.</p><p>In the end, this was not one of those vintage Watanabe collections that set copyists off on a new path for seasons to come; but his inventive touch had a quiet appeal nonetheless.</p></div>"
58,fall,2004,f2004,kenneth-cole-new-york,"Kenneth Cole’s fall collection was aimed squarely at the time-starved but fashion-loving modern woman who has minimal time to spend in front of her closet before dashing out the door.</p><p>Aiming for can’t-lose classics, Cole showed simple tailored sportswear like full-leg wool flannel trousers topped by fine gauge sweaters and neat, belted trenches; motorcycle-style jackets cut slim to the body with broad, dramatic lapels and worn over skinny pants; slim, knee-length skirts; and easy jersey dresses. As might be expected from a man who started out in footwear, there was lots of leather, worked into the clothes or done up on its own into long swinging coats, roomy bombers, over-the-knee boots, and big totes.</p><p>It wasn’t all dress-and-dash, though; Cole showed his charming side with Art Deco-detailed slips and bias-cut satin frocks, worn with fuzzy sweaters or one of those motorcycle jackets. Because even the hardest-working professional has to make time for nightlife, after all.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""z3azog""></div></div><p>—Janet Ozzard</p></div>"
59,fall,2004,f2004,lagerfeld-gallery,"Karl Lagerfeld has always been pretty adept at drawing on a wide range of disparate references to make one very satisfying collection. Such was the case with his fall show at Lagerfeld Gallery, where sports influences, menswear tailoring, and slinky chiffon eveningwear all mingled happily on the same runway.</p><p>Lagerfeld opened with a selection of sexy, sportif snow parkas and anoraks, which then morphed into masculine wool pantsuits, some featuring leather panels inlaid at the waist, worn with substantial-collared white cotton shirts. He also showed some great zippered jackets, cut close to the body from purple astrakhan or brown leather. Evening meant a series of slinky chiffon dresses, long and short, which came pleated and trimmed with leather. At the close of the show, Lagerfeld made another reference, this one inadvertent: He quick-stepped around the runway in a natty silver-gray suit that would have looked just as good on one of his models. The designer himself as inspiration? Now there's a source worth quoting.</p></div>"
60,fall,2004,f2004,lanvin,"Alber Elbaz has been putting an inordinate amount of thought into making his vision of glamorous dressing an easy, relevant proposition for modern women. The most striking example came midway through his show, when an elegant twisted loop in the back of a short black silk dress was unpinned to fall from the shoulder, transforming itself into a starkly simple train. Every woman in the audience got this immediately: Two fabulous dresses for the price of one.</p><p>There were other such devices, like a kind of draped silk apron that untied to leave a bare shift beneath, or a gray sheath that came with a couple of removable net layers. For day, there were vests that could be worn over or under coats, and detachable shirt collars and cuffs to pop into dresses according to mood and occasion.</p><p>More simply, Elbaz reprised some of the elements that have brought him a growing following (a wide age span of fans that includes both Kate Moss and Gretchen Leach, wife of the American ambassador to France, both sitting front row.) The collection featured his taffeta trenches, the satin ribbon details he's made his own, a slew of his signature dresses, and his much-copied use of jewelry. He pinned slightly antiqued crystal flower brooches on day dresses and popped shredded chiffon roses in buttonholes; evening saw a reprise of his sparkling ribbon-backed neckpieces, now grown into long multiple strands. Still, it was the simplest of his dress ideas that stood out as the most modern and provocative: a white satin tank dress, knotted up the side with bows, slipped under a glamorous cloud of tufty, gray-tipped fox.</p></div>"
61,fall,2004,f2004,lawrence-steele,"Lawrence Steele has a delicate way of tearing leaves out of fashion history and lightly rewriting them for a new generation. For fall, he said, he was thinking of ""Balenciaga, Chanel, Vionnet. The beauty that once was, as an ideal—but we're in today."" Almost everyone is referencing the twentieth-century greats these days, either literally or at some crumpled remove, but Steele isn't one of the shredders. His version of fall's now-familiar equation—silky dresses, camisoles, little skirts, and furs—comes out with a meticulous finish.</p><p>Contriving to infuse a sense of chic into his collection, Steele also managed to sidestep the inherent pitfalls of both ladylike frumpery and saccharine girlishness that beset many designers who set off down the well-trodden retro road. Some of that came through his subtle way of mixing soft sorbet shades of the same color in the same outfit (a <em>bois de rose</em> angora cardigan with a flesh-pink skirt, say, or two mismatching tints of green), and resisting the temptations of over decoration. He also leavened the frilly fragility of the dressy look with a few cool yoke-backed coats and dresses taken from the book of Balenciaga. Simply styled with bead-encrusted satin pumps, the look had a certain abbreviated modernity that set it refreshingly apart from standard vintage rehash.</p></div>"
62,fall,2004,f2004,libertine,"“It was seamless!” said Cindy Greene, half of the design duo Libertine, shortly after the label’s debut runway show—a somewhat ironic statement coming from someone with a penchant for exposed seams and other deconstructive details. Established in 2001, Libertine is a collaboration with a twist: The New York-based Greene is separated by 3,000 miles from her partner, Johnson Hartig, who lives in Los Angeles. That hasn’t stopped them from developing a cult following for their one-of-a-kind, reconstructed vintage pieces, which work a feeling that Greene describes as about “nature, the macabre, and early Americana.”</p><p>The presentation, in the café attached to St. Bartholomew’s Church, attracted an audience—many members decked out in Libertine gear—that included Michael Stipe, Jimmy Fallon, Helena Christensen, Patti Hansen, and Monet Mazur. They gave an enthusiastic reception to the label’s quirky reworkings, like tweed pants printed with falling autumn leaves or a fifties beaded sweater embellished with ribbons, brooches, and a screen-printed skull. Kilts, trenches, capes, and dresses were equally transfigured via prints of eyes, dancing bears, bird heads, and even a portrait of Lincoln. At a time when polished prettiness is ruling the runways, Libertine’s strikingly individual pieces stand as a kind of fashion-world call to live free or die—and to look good either way.</p></div>"
63,fall,2004,f2004,london-roundup,"The city's fashion week is in a state of flux, as some designers decamp for more visible pastures, others cut back, and a (rare) few expand to the runway. Here's a look at some who still call London home.</p><p><strong>Hamish Morrow</strong> was a no-show this season, opting to present his technically complex collection—he likes to integrate high-tech concepts with traditional methods of making clothes—in a Paris showroom. For fall, he ran lengths of stretchy industrial cord through silk jersey to make dresses and tops which can be draped, ruched, and tightened by the wearer. Prints were derived from thermal imaging, which mapped the body to show clusters of color—swirling forms of purple, magenta, and green—at the stress points. As always, his knack is melding opulent, feminine surface effects onto sporty bases: One outstanding piece was a slick coat panelled in champagne sequins. Why the change in venue? ""It's a time when I felt it sensible to reorganize and concentrate on selling,"" he said.</p><p>Sometimes, London fashion is more about a scene than a show. Looked at in a crowd or at a party (and especially after a couple of drinks), the way Kate Moss and her crowd mishmash their clothes can seem a work of genius. Such is the milieu of <strong>FrostFrench</strong>'s Sadie Frost and Jemima French, who have wisely until now presented their cute bits-and-pieces collections in various faux-party settings. This season, however, the amateur charm evaporated when they put the clothes on the runway. The vaguely gypsy layerings of teeny skirts, smocks, denims, and hand-knits fell pretty flat—even with Moss beaming supportively from the front row.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""5przk9""></div></div><p><strong>Alice Temperley</strong> has won her place as London's girly-dressmaker-in-chief in the space of three short seasons, with her flapper-esque frocks, cute Cubist knits, and little coats fast gaining a following of young socials on both sides of the Atlantic. For fall, her references were plucked from the demimonde of fin de siècle Paris. Nothing too literally historical, of course—just a good excuse for Temperley's usual sprinkling of beads on tulle and silk.</p><p>Aaron Sharif and Sachiko Okada of <strong>Blaak</strong> want an international challenge, so they're showing across the Channel. ""London has been good to us, but we've reached the stage where we're not new any more, and we want to see how it is in Paris,"" they said at a walkthrough of the fall line. Named Blaakistan, the collection plays up their fusion of ethnic sensibilities (his parentage is Pakistani, hers Japanese; they live in London's East End), twisting inspiration from Central Asian textiles into brightly layered, punkish looks.</p></div>"
64,fall,2004,f2004,louis-vuitton,"From the moment 16-year-old Lily Cole, wearing a belted, fur-collared tartan coat, set her dainty high-heeled golden bootie onto the snow-covered runway, it was clear this was about to be one of Marc Jacobs¿ delicious Louis Vuitton blockbusters.</p><p>Making tartan and solid country fabrics young and sexy isn¿t easy—as all too many designers have proved this season. Jacobs clinched it, though—cutting plaid tight, on the cross, in tiny leg-o'-mutton puffed-sleeve blouses and making slim tweedy skirts explode into flirty, petticoated godets in the hem. On top, he would add girlish tippets (one in faux ermine) tied with a satin bow and accessorize, accessorize: There were velvet bags printed with the house monogram and trompe l'oeil hardware, furry purses, and a myriad shoe-temptations (high plaid spectators, patent stiletto ghillies, brocade ankle boots fastened with ribbon).</p><p>""Scotland, Tissot, a little Foujita,"" said Jacobs, reeling off his research references. To elaborate: His design team had taken a tour of the Highlands, circling Balmoral (Her Majesty the Queen's grand Scottish bolt-hole), then patched in the frothy French prettiness of James Tissot's bustles and lace. The work of Tsuguharu Foujita, a Japanese traditionalist painter who worked in Paris in the twenties, also got pinned to the inspiration boards, striking a cute note for Japan's legion of LV fans.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""6p1hrm""></div></div><p>The Tissot prettiness—swagged tartan taffeta, bustle bows, lace-framed décollétes, frilled fur capelets—just prevented the collection from tipping over the Scottish border into a full-on Vivienne Westwood homage. (Though, since her retrospective at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London is imminent, Jacobs is probably ahead of the curve in saluting her.) In fact, this show, so delightfully full of rich pickings, was dedicated to another design great who had a profound influence on Jacobs. Stephen Sprouse, the friend who collaborated on the famous Louis Vuitton graffiti bags, died this week, and Jacobs acknowledged his loss in a moving program note.</p></div>"
65,fall,2004,f2004,luca-luca,"Luca Orlandi said that the guiding spirit for his fall collection was Lara Croft, the danger-loving adventuress of <em>Tomb Raider</em> fame. And the slithery, revealing looks he sent out for fall certainly seem likely to land their wearer in precarious situations—which she’s clearly equipped to handle, of course.</p><p>This tough-but-sexy babe dresses primarily in black, although it’s anything but basic: shiny silk satin, fur-trimmed wool, and, naturally, lots of leather. The cut is scuba-suit tight (all the better for sliding out of tight squeezes) and accessorized with ruching, Swarovski crystals, bias ruffles, lacing, and fur. The accessory of choice? A teetery stiletto (which doubles handily as a weapon). Orlandi mixed in some neat wool coats and even a cozy bulky black sweater for days when his heroine is laying low, while the scattering of rose-petal pink dresses are perfect for those moments when a little old-fashioned femininity is called for. For evening, Orlandi sent out high-drama body-hugging gowns that a latter-day Lara will happily sport—especially if it’s on a red carpet.</p></div>"
66,fall,2004,f2004,luella,"Luella Bartley’s delightful fall collection was inspired by one of the most beloved English archetypes—the bohemian aristo who wears a cashmere sweater with Wellies, drives a Range Rover filled with muddy dogs, and can tell equally risqué personal anecdotes about the Rolling Stones and Henry VIII.</p><p>Bartley’s fall basics for this character (and all who would emulate her) include drainpipe jeans, cut tight right down to the ankle and worn with frilly voile blouses or a short, sporty navy car coat; little tweedy blazers that end at the top of the hip; and motorcycle jackets in black or pale lavender goatskin. That’s for mucking about in the stables (or roaming Portobello Road); for tea time, she goes a bit more feminine with indigo blue or acid-green sheer mini-caftans over tights or trousers. Popping up to town for a day calls for the jersey and suede cardigan over a neat little pencil skirt, worn with chunky high heels tied on with wide satin ribbons. She trucks this all around in one of Bartley’s ever-popular leather “Gisele” satchels, decorated with all sorts of whimsical stencils and leather charms. After all, noblesse oblige means never being seen carrying any old grotty handbag.</p></div>"
67,fall,2004,f2004,marc-by-marc-jacobs,"Sometimes familiarity breeds <em>content</em>. Marc Jacobs’s secondary line is now well enough established that its retro stylings, shrunken fit, and resolutely seventies vibe no longer look remotely quirky. Quite the opposite: The label has become a reliably hip commercial success. As if to confirm this comfortable status, Jacobs himself seems to have lost any vestige of pre-show jitters; he spent the last few minutes before the lights went down strolling the runway, posing for photos, and chatting with friends.</p><p>Against a soundtrack of Dinosaur Jr. and the Pixies, Jacobs showed the sweeter side of fall. He used soft fabrics like pinwale corduroy, moleskin, mohair, fluttery silk, cotton jersey, and even a bit of fur, in a color palette that was calm and muted: pale blues, greens, yellows, and creams, mixed with mocha, tan, navy, and black. He threw in a few printed blouses and some fuzzy sweaters, plus lots of the pea coats, T-shirts, and denim pieces that have become staples of the line. But the real fun comes in watching him balance the mix: a white T-shirt under a blue printed blouse, under a brown silk dress; a ruffled black velvet dress over a blue-striped sweater. While only a few of his customers can pull off that kind of eclectic styling, they all know that if they’re looking for just one cool piece to freshen up their whole closet, Marc can likely provide it.</p></div>"
68,fall,2004,f2004,marc-jacobs,"Sending Gisele Bündchen out to open and close your show is not the gesture of someone who shies from the spotlight. Coming from Marc Jacobs, it seemed a declaration of a new direction: After spending the first ten years at his own label as the indie/artsy crowd's favorite designer, he’s itching to move over into the multimillion-dollar mainstream. And why not? If knockoffs are the opinion polls of fashion, he’s won by a landslide, season after season.</p><p>Adept as he is at reading his customer's mind, Jacobs knows she doesn't take well to dictates; her closet is her playground. For spring, she's got a proper/naughty thing going on: sort of <em>Mona Lisa Smile</em> meets <em>Secretary</em>. (Wait, isn't that Maggie Gyllenhaal in the front row?) The proper showed up as elegant fit-and-flare tweed skirts, printed and pin-tucked silk blouses, lace-covered dresses, and great tweedy coats with just-so mink collars, all in superb fabrics and whispery soft colors like cream, mint, turquoise, and icy blue. And the naughty? That would be the earsplitting Distillers soundtrack, the saucy plunge necklines, and the teetering Vargas Girl pumps that gave the models' runway walks a hip-swiveling come-hither attitude. Jacobs' eveningwear gets more sophisticated each season, and this time he recalled Hollywood at its height; his gowns were tumbling cascades of chiffon or charmeuse in jewel tones that polished off the show, literally.</p></div>"
69,fall,2004,f2004,marni,"The typically dreamy, barefoot-in-the-kitchen Marni woman has become increasingly chic over the past few seasons. For winter, she's done her hair in a cool rockabilly quiff, donned high-heeled pumps and a fur shrug, and apparently purloined pieces from her man's wardrobe to go with her own favorite vintagey finds. ""I felt it was time to be a little more grown-up,"" designer Consuelo Castiglioni said, ""and to have a certain luxe, but without ostentation.""</p><p>Castiglioni did ""eccentric"" years before the fashion community began to use it as a term of approval. So, it was interesting to watch her clean up her silhouette, cinching waists with corseted obis, and calm her colors to classic beige, gray, navy, and bottle green. If that sounds a little dull, it didn't play that way. While the gray flannel trousers and fine-gauge sweaters looked new, there were also quietly confident renditions of all the things—three-quarter-sleeve coats, romantic prints, chiffon dresses—that the label's followers love to collect.</p><p>Most interesting, though, is the turnaround in the look of Marni's furs. The house started out with a mission to change perceptions about fur by creating playfully irreverent, undone patchworks and shapes that would look like completely different animals from the things Mom used to wear. Now—lo and behold—fashion has gone full circle. Marni's fall furs look almost exactly like softer renditions of fifties and sixties shrugs, boleros, and capes—and are all the more irresistible for it.</p></div>"
70,fall,2004,f2004,martin-grant,"Free advice to off-schedule designers who want to get an overextended, appointment-crazed Paris audience on their side: Start on time and get it over with quickly. Slapped wrists to Martin Grant for breaking the code, thereby filling the room with irritation before he'd even started. As a civilian lady invitee whispered, after looking at watch for the fifteenth time, ""Is this normal?""</p><p>Part of the charm of the grown-up, well-considered clothes Martin Grant designs from his workshop in the Marais is the small-scale immediacy of what he does. His followers expect an elegant seasonal shortcut into the kind of classic style that looks youthful (but rich) at any age. Some of that came over in his signature coats, done just so in a single-breasted pony version trimmed with leather, a narrow-waisted black Lurex evening trench, or three-quarter-length fifties tweed. This season, though, a heavy-sense-of-fashion theme made the magic evaporate.</p><p>Grant started with a belted cape-dress, proceeded to a coat-dress with capelet shoulders and a black-and-white tweed trench with the same cut, and followed that with tight black-and-pink brocade tweed cocktail dresses with a light hint of Suzie Wong. (Grant explained he'd been watching ""old Japanese gangster movies and Marlene Dietrich in <em>Shanghai Express</em>."") But all the lightness and color Grant captured in his last collection, and which fashion is craving this season, somehow eluded him. As a matter of fact, he isn't a designer who suffers from pretentiousness, but the couturelike surroundings he chose and the agonizing repetitiousness of this show almost made it seem so.</p></div>"
71,fall,2004,f2004,martine-sitbon,"Martine Sitbon and her art director partner, Marc Ascoli (the man who has worked on advertising campaigns for everyone from Jil Sander to Yohji Yamamoto), are one of the boldface fashion couples of the City of Light. Naturally, their show often attracts the hipper, artier elements of Parisian society: If there isn't a groovy little contingent of women who look like Jane Birkin circa <em>Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus</em> and men with scruffy hair and (deliberately) scruffier suits, then something is amiss.</p><p>But it's not just Sitbon's status that draws the crowds: Her collections lure them in, too. She has perfected, over the past few seasons, a move away from her stark, severe look to something that's much easier—a kind of dreamy romanticism shot through with a street-cred sports vibe. She's also demonstrated an original way with color: This fall¿s combinations, as evinced by the paneled velvet and silk dresses that closed the show, might include mushroom, cream, scarlet, and sapphire blue.</p><p>The best of the bunch were the thirties dance dresses that looked like they could have stepped out of a Brassai photograph—all layers of pearl pink or creamy white chiffon, undulating hems, fluttery sleeves, and intriguing decoration. One had a gently quilted bib front and cap sleeves. There were also some fine cable knits—a slow-burner trend in Paris—here used for short fitted sweaters that had sleeves like tiny shrugs. Some of the tailoring, however, didn¿t make the grade, partly because the idea of reversing jackets and coats so that the linings show is never wise, partly because the cut was so ungainly it committed the cardinal sin of making the models look dumpy. The next time Sitbon shows, it will be those chiffon dresses that grace her front row.</p></div>"
72,fall,2004,f2004,max-mara,"Who thinks about the working woman these days? That¿s a down-to-earth question that doesn¿t appear to blip across many designers¿ radar screens in the twenty-first century, at least not when they¿re lining up runway parades for the press. MaxMara, on the other hand, is one of the few solid supporters of the belief that a woman in winter may (at the least) need a good coat in order to get through the humdrum A to B. This season, as it happens, a savvy style choice could well be an updated camel-hair classic. MaxMara has been in that business since the fifties, and this season's show revolved around its iconic belted coat, along with other aspects of town-and-country outerwear. There were small Norfolk jackets and shearling aviators that seemed nicely on-trend yet not limited to the category of one-season-only fashion statements.</p><p>The problem comes in fleshing out that pragmatic core as a fully realized collection. Yes, big flaring skirts are part of the current scene but they don¿t necessarily do much for the hips in blanket-weight fabrics. Ditto cable knits and Swarovski crystal when married into the same sweater. MaxMara can also stretch its credibility by feeling the need to show eveningwear. This season, the design team picked out the crystal-encrusted jersey keyhole disco gowns of the late seventies designer Loris Azzaro as a trendy reference du jour. Fine, but it¿s still those elegant coats that will keep the MaxMara woman coming back for more.</p></div>"

He spent five years as the head of Jil Sander’s design team, launched Burberry’s apparel collection and designed it for three years, and put in a season at Cerruti.</p><p>“We were thinking, What are the needs of this new generation?” said Menichetti, at the low-key presentation of his new signature label. “They live in a world that’s more of the senses, and less of the mind.” Refining that vision over almost two years, Menichetti, a minimalist at heart, has pared things down as much as possible. “No jeans line, no secondary line,” he explained. “You have everything here. A simple sweatshirt, next to a T-shirt, next to a cashmere sweater. This is how people dress now. It’s all about versatility.” It’s also about clean lines, luxurious Italian fabrics, and a simple mix-and-match palette of white, black, khaki, indigo blue, and pink. Now that he’s back behind the wheel, Menichetti is raring to go: His 5-year plan includes footwear, fragrance, even home. Stay tuned.</p></div>"
74,fall,2004,f2004,michael-kors-collection,"Bursting with confidence: That could describe Michael Kors’s ideal woman, his fall show or, these days, the designer himself. In the past year, Kors has been on a business-building rampage. He sold his company, tripled his staff, moved into a mammoth new office space, and introduced a lower-priced line with multimillion-dollar ambitions.</p><p>The collection was rooted in Kors’s favorite luxe materials (cashmere, fluttery silks, fine-gauge knits, suede, and lots and lots of fur) and strong tailoring. As expected, there were classics aplenty—suede jeans, an Aran-knit tank top, dramatic sweeping coats, and perfect little sweaters. But there was also a new friskiness on the runway. Kors jettisoned his usual neutrals for juicy colors like lavender, light blue, coral, and chocolate, and mixed in lots of pieces that require a certain youthful bravura (not to mention great legs) to pull off: fringed suede minis, slippery silk blouses, and clingy jersey dresses with rippling knee-length skirts. He piled on the accessories, too, topping the outfits with hefty belts, tooled-leather bags, floppy felt hats, or a knitted mink scarf in a spun-sugar color. In this kind of mood, Kors certainly isn’t feeling like an early-to-bed guy; he closed the show with a handful of high-glamour evening gowns, including one bronze beaded showstopper that glowed like a bright new day.</p></div>"
75,fall,2004,f2004,missoni,"Last season, the house of Missoni celebrated its golden jubilee with a spectacular parade of outfits representing 50 years of vibrant creativity. For fall, Angela Missoni, who has inherited the mantle of many colors from her parents, company founders Tai and Rosita, had clearly been inspired by that rich summation.</p><p>In a season dominated by the eclecticism and luxe bohemianism that is the house signature, Missoni evoked both ladylike Camelot elegance—Lurex-knit sheath dresses complete with velvet clutch purses and upswept hairdos—and the hippie looks that first put the label on the map in the early seventies: swirling Art Nouveau prints, knit capes, fringing, and chiffon palazzo pajamas. Capes were a strong theme, from the short zigzag-knit number in Neapolitan ice cream colors that opened the show (over short shorts) through the chiffon minidress with a floor-length fringed cape in back. Giant silk cabbage roses worn on chokers at the neck or pinned to the hip were a pretty touch (and ready for a Sarah Moon close-up), although knee socks worn with the high-heeled court shoes were definitely not.</p><p>Missoni's stylish furs cleverly referenced the house's trademark knits, as horizontally banded mink or fox coats were subtly graduated from collar to hem in tones from black to white or arctic to red, respectively. Organic, Lava Lamp appliqué details recalled the wacky spage-age looks of Pierre Cardin, currently the subject of a retrospective at Carla Sozzani's Corso Como gallery. With true pan-generational appeal, the show included pieces suitable for Rosita Missoni, as well as looks that were perfect for her granddaughter, It girl Margherita.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""qdvey""></div></div><p>Dramatic evening gowns in colored Lurex or vibrant kaleidoscope prints, suspended from jeweled halters, suggested Sharon Stone¿s va-va-voom wardrobe in <em>Casino</em>, while a fringed knit dress looked as though the model had wrapped herself in a gypsy shawl—a dramatic gesture worthy of the Belle Époque dancer Loie Fuller, actress Eleonora Duse, or society beauty Consuelo Vanderbilt, all of whom Missoni cited as influences.</p></div>"
76,fall,2004,f2004,miu-miu,"The Miu Miu label is ideal for those times when we feel like scanning the stores for an inexpensive simulacrum of a designer look—as in, every other Saturday, minimum. And when fall rolls around, and we are seized by the urgent need for a long plain boyish V-neck cardigan, or something tweedy and vintagey with a sparkly detail and a scrap-of-fur collar, or a dress with a semi-destroyed sexual allure, Miu Miu will be right there with the goods.</p><p>That's hardly surprising, because it was Miuccia Prada who invented, or reinvented, this look in the first place. Not that Miu Miu is an ersatz replica of Prada (leave that to the copyists). In this collection, she added original extras, like beat-up washed-leather jackets, long-line maxi coats, slim calf-length dresses, and skirts reminiscent of early seventies Ossie Clark. Beaded, jewelled details were applied to the oversize buttons on tweed coats and small forties-styled jackets, the edges of inverted pleats on skirts, and the toes of dainty brocade pumps. All of this was held together by a magically subtle color sense—chestnut, mousy browns, grays, maroons, and dull flashes of bronze, copper, antique gold, and green.</p><p>While some of the signature, crinkled lining-silk dresses looked irresistible, others—especially the sheer printed frocks—presented a what-do-I-do-with-this challenge. Ninety-nine percent of this collection, though, was totally liveable, mixable fashion—testament to Miuccia Prada's commercial intelligence, as well as her storied talent.</p></div>"
77,fall,2004,f2004,monique-lhuillier,"Despite her very French name, Monique Lhuillier is a West Coast-based designer who started out in bridal before showing her first ready-to-wear collection in 2003. Her dresses have been appearing with increasing frequency on the red carpet, but, as her fall show demonstrated, Lhuillier knows how to appeal to a demographic beyond just celebrities.</p><p>Trading in the flirty florals she favored for spring, the designer mixed a little bit of naughty in with the nice. Delicate corsets peeked out from under cashmere cardigans and Chanel-y ribbon-trimmed tweed jackets, while a chocolate velvet tuxedo had a sexy, sophisticated edge. Not all her silhouettes worked. Sleek, super-narrow looks (exemplified by a double-crepe suit and a lovely A-line dress with lilac cummerbund) shared the stage with full-skirted and ruffled pieces that were more prom than cocktail. The real stars of the collection were Lhuillier's coats: Her bronze lamé trench and fox-trimmed embroidered overcoat would catch the eye of any paparazzo.</p></div>"
78,fall,2004,f2004,moschino,"The jaunty little creature who pops up on Moschino's runway every season doesn't distress herself over the subtext of her clothes. No retro irony for her; she's more interested in the best opportunities to look cute. This season, of course, the young-lady-in-the-fifties look will suit her purposes to a T.</p><p>From the little wired ribbon-and-velvet hair ornaments to the Betty Boop pumps, Moschino's young woman has that down pat. There was a matchy-matchy moment, played with a silver-threaded tweed suit with a fluffy white Peter Pan fur collar worn with a swinging bag in the same fabric. The show ran on at length, through Chanel-inspired tweeds, tiered skirts perked out with tulle petticoats, and any number of flirtatious printed afternoon dresses. For all its cheeriness, though, a heavy air of inevitability is beginning to hang over collections like this. Moschino will be heaving with sweet, no-brainer, period pieces for fall—like so many others who have taken an obvious cue from Miuccia Prada, but skipped the intellectual thought process that puts her leagues ahead.</p></div>"
79,fall,2004,f2004,narciso-rodriguez,"It’s not by chance that Narciso Rodriguez calls his meticulous jackets and dresses “constructed.” They’re cut, shaped, and sewn with a relentless attention to detail that might have made Mies van der Rohe reconsider his calling. But for fall, Rodriguez’s chilled-to-perfection, skintight dresses and suits got a bit warmer with the help of plush fabrics, a sprinkling of fluffy fur, and even (gasp) some ruffles.</p><p>Never fear, Rodriguez followers: His signature body-hugging designs in monastic black or cream are still clearly the engine that drives the line and delights his front row (which included Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, and Claire Danes). But there’s a new sensuousness working its way into the intellectual exercise: Electric-blue piping streaks around the torso of a black dress; satin ribbon hugs the curves of a black pencil skirt; cozy little shrugs come in ballet-pink cashmere or a pouf of black shearling.</p><p>While he showed a few slim trousers, Rodriguez loves skirts and dresses, and that’s where he really cut loose. Alongside his beloved pencil, there were flippy gored styles, ruffly satin cha-cha looks, and some lovely A-line pieces packed with rows of tiny lace ruffles. For evening, he twisted yards of sheer ribbon around the torsos of satin-skirted gowns; just the right wrapping for his smart, cool customers.</p></div>"
80,fall,2004,f2004,nina-ricci,"The current spate of designer departures from European houses has taught the fashion world a very important lesson: Know thy customer. Tom Ford at Gucci knew exactly what kind of woman he was dressing and succeeded. Julien Macdonald at Givenchy clearly didn't and failed. Does Lars Nilsson know who the Nina Ricci woman is? He certainly has the talent to rise to the occasion but he is also clearly still fine-tuning the answer to that question.</p><p>He isn't helped in this elusive search by the label's total lack of identity. Unlike those other moribund houses that have been given the kiss of life (with varying degrees of success), Nina Ricci, the fragrance aside, means absolutely nada. It had no defining moment in its past; it has no design icon that can be reworked for a modern audience; and, while it's French, it doesn't resonate with the kind of magical chic that some Parisian houses do.</p><p>These are not, of course, problems of Nilsson's making, but they add to the challenges he faces. Oddly, he seemed far surer of where to take the house last spring, when he showed a fine, focused color palette of brown, blue, yellow, and orange and a sophisticated mix of sharp suits, soft dresses, and sweet lingerie. This collection felt more muddled in its approach. Given Nilsson's strengths with color and decoration, it was inevitable that he would be drawn to the vintagey, just-pulled-it-out-of-my-closet, highly personal feel that is driving the season. The ruffled tweed jacket and cropped pants that opened the show worked, as did the billowing silk blouses; the tulle-veiled dresses worn with sparkly shawls didn't. And the cumbersome triangular shrugs were just odd from a designer who never normally does tricky. Perhaps next season will prove that old adage: Third time's a charm.</p></div>"
81,fall,2004,f2004,oscar-de-la-renta,"Fabulous handiwork; rich, spicy colors; shapes cut to flatter. These are Oscar de la Renta’s calling cards, and his socialite-packed front row is testament to the designer’s mastery of the opulent-meets-elegant genre.</p><p>For fall, de la Renta played up the curves, showing hip-hugging pencil skirts and bias-cut A-line shapes that undulated beneath slim, snug jackets or lush cashmere sweaters. Tweed is the fabric of choice this season, but de la Renta never let his fabrics get too heavy; a neatly cut, nubby grey dress ended in a waft of flirty fluff at the hem, while a brown flared skirt got a lift from a spray of guinea hen feathers. De la Renta also loves a fur trim and he worked sable, shearling, mink, and lamb into places both expected (collars, cuffs, vests, and coats) and otherwise (the edge of a skirt).</p><p>De la Renta’s evening looks, all garnished with Fred Leighton jewels, hit a series of luxurious highs. A Balenciaga-esque cascade of satin poured down the back of a strict, fitted satin sheath, while a dramatic black-tulle bustier was paired with a swinging beaded skirt. And for those with a fairy-tale ball in their future, any of the designer’s star-spangled tulle gowns will be just the ticket.</p></div>"
82,fall,2004,f2004,perry-ellis,"Aside from snapping cameras and chattering editors, the only sound to be heard at the Perry Ellis show was that of a nail being hit squarely on its head. In his pitch-perfect second collection for the label, Patrick Robinson captured the season’s pretty, eccentric femininity with just the right dose of color, wit, and lightness.</p><p>As with his spring show, Robinson staged the collection as a walk-through, posing models in a tableau that allowed the audience to examine at leisure. There were nostalgic references to decades past in the loose coats and trim pencil skirts done up in camel hair or tweed, the cardigans with jeweled buttons, the A-line skirts in pastel colors, and the vintage brooches that glittered on almost every lapel—not to mention the models’ twisted updos and rosebud lips. But the mix also included some very modern, city girl-tough pieces like a slouchy trouser suit, a pale pink satin puffa, and a nifty fake-fur vest worn over a slim green jacket. Perry Ellis made his name with just that kind of finely observed, slouchy chic, and it’s now quite clear how well Robinson understands the spirit of the venerable house.</p></div>"
83,fall,2004,f2004,peter-som,"Peter Som’s fall inspiration was a giddily off-the-beam aristocrat of the <em>Grey Gardens</em> genre: the kind of woman who piles a big gold heirloom brooch (or three) on her unraveling tweed and pulls herself together with the help of a thin alligator belt (and maybe a midmorning martini). It was a great starting point for a lighthearted, swinging collection that touched on the season’s emerging trends with Som’s usual charm.</p><p>Som poured on the colors. He mixed apple green, chocolate brown, and lilac in the first outfit alone and then added in pale blue, deep plum, taupey pink, and navy. His fabrics had plenty of texture to play with, as well. There were the season’s darlings, tweed and chiffon, in addition to soft cashmere knits, moiré taffeta, wool gabardine, tulle, a vine-printed silk twill, and heavy duchesse satin, all decked with fox, sheared mink, and plenty of gleaming Verdura pins. He kept the silhouette ladylike but not fusty: There were pencil skirts, boxy jackets, sheath dresses, elegant collarless coats, and great low-slung trousers, worn with Alexandra Neel’s sexy, strappy stilettos. As his socialite-packed front row attests, Som is a dab hand at the special-event wardrobe. This time, he showed a lovely fluid black charmeuse camisole with the skirt covered in fluttering chiffon leaves, an elegant black silk moiré sheath with a deep-plunging back, and a pink-chiffon beaded confection that will tickle the fancy of bluebloods far and wide.</p></div>"
84,fall,2004,f2004,phi,"It's rare for a debut to be as slick and sophisticated as that of Phi, a sportswear company that showed its first collection in a mammoth, sun-drenched Chelsea industrial space on the last afternoon of Fashion Week. But Phi (pronounced ""fee"") is funded by Susan Dell, the very deep-pocketed wife of billionaire computer entrepreneur Michael Dell, so production values were in the money-is-no-object realm (up there, where Guido Palau is your go-to hair guy).</p><p>The collection's creative director is Tim Gardner, a former Calvin Klein-Jil Sander designer, and his loyalty to that school of luxe minimalism came through in the limited palette of black, wine, cream, and brown, and in the attention he lavished on utilitarian pieces like beautifully cut motorcycle jackets in leather or tweed, smart trenches, elegant long coats, and safari jackets. He played delicate off rough with fluttery dresses made from raw-edged silks worn with stompin' high-heeled motorcycle boots and detailed his pieces with silver D-rings and bits of sheer fabric. Bulky black knits got a bit heavy with walls of hanging fringe, though. Phi may be funded by a wealthy woman, but it's clearly no vanity project; this was a complete, thought-out collection filled with great pieces to make its front row—including the professionally glamorous Diane Sawyer—very happy.</p></div>"
85,fall,2004,f2004,pierrot,"Pierre Carrilero loves to spin a tale as much as a piece of yarn, and his Pierrot shows are always encased in some clever, cracked conceit: fairy tales, seaside frolics, triple-X filmmaking. It's a wise move on his part. His knitwear may have charm to spare, but he's still working in a very limited genre. For fall, the designer took a far more traditional route, making his show resemble the old French salon presentations, with running commentary on each outfit and models mincing demurely down the runway (to the far-out accompaniment of a theremin).</p><p>Carrilero has been doing slightly twisted, retro femininity for years, so his lacy, sex-addled pointelle knits and tiny flouncy skirts fit right into this fall's growing taste for the look. Ditto his bulky yarns, worked into cozy snug sweaters with various <em>très francais</em> intarsia designs (Eiffel Tower, poodles, etc.) worn over slim pencil skirts. His color choices got a bit loud at times, and skintight leggings are rarely flattering, but a Pierrot show always leaves its audience with a smile on its face—not to mention a yen for a few new sweaters.</p></div>"
86,fall,2004,f2004,pollini,"Rifat Ozbek, the Turkish-born designer who first made his name in London in the eighties, stepped back onto the runway with a show of 27 looks for the Italian footwear company Pollini. ""It's modern, exotic, Tibetan!"" he said of a collection conceived as a brief introductory statement of intent for the new line.</p><p>Melding ethnic influences to contemporary shapes has always been Ozbek's thing. He brought together digitalized jewel prints, tiger stripes, brocades, double-faced felts, and herringbone tweed into a tight collection aimed to appeal to the city woman's inner hippie. Standouts were neat coats in ivory or rust wool, implanted with Himalayan embroideries, and the coin-decorated leather boots with low heels picked out in color. Backstage, his loyal fan base cheered Ozbek's promising return to the scene.</p></div>"
87,fall,2004,f2004,prada,"Audiences always arrive at Prada shows tingling with anticipation, braced for Miuccia Prada's next departure from the last season¿s plot. This time, she confounded expectation again, not by taking off in a new direction, but by developing the cache of ideas layered into her spring collection. That, of course, was famously about the fifties lady tourist, with an overlay of hippie-ish tie-dye among the circle skirts and knits. For winter, she took that same woman into new realms of intellectual exploration on the print front: back to the future, in fact.</p><p>""It was a dream of extreme romanticism,"" she said. ""The idea of eighteenth-century painting, with video games. A romanticism between past and future."" The cyber fantasy came in computer-generated prints on her signature big, puffy skirts and the odd quirky robot appliqué on gray T-shirts. Yet none of that seemed jarringly obtrusive in a collection that concentrated again on the in-and-out silhouette she established last season. For colder months, she¿s added more layers, adding in dip-dyed cable knits and buttonless cardigans betwixt tweeds and bejeweled fifties-style couture-like pieces. What held it all together, literally, were the cinched waists, circled in narrow grosgrain ribbon or with tie-on belts encrusted with sparkle.</p><p>It was that idea of jeweling, on collars, belts, and fabric brooches, that added the news. In a brilliant leap, she transposed those crunchy patches of decoration onto fitted down jackets—a perfect conflation of old-world luxury with classic Prada techno fabric that stood as the symbol of the entire collection.</p></div>"
88,fall,2004,f2004,preen-by-thornton-bregazzi,"Thea Bregazzi and Justin Thornton are generally thought of as gritty Portobello deconstructionists, so it might come as a surprise to find them quoting that classic of French-movie style, <em>Belle de Jour</em>, as the inspiration for Preen' s fall season. Still, even though it's probably the most clichéd fashion reference of all time, the designers applied the haute bourgeois aesthetic in their own way, and it put a refreshingly polished accent on their usual streetwise repertoire.</p><p>The jolt of sophistication began with a long, high-belted, skinny camel coat with a pointy standing collar, followed by a pair of smart beige trousers and a matching cashmere sweater. The designers gently advanced that calm sense of normality by piecing fragments of shearling into other asymmetric camel coats or by fusing tweed into lapels. Their signature jerseys (descended from sweatshirts, somewhere along the way) appeared as flared, slinky dresses, falling below the knee and sprouting bits of rib-knit in odd places. For evening, there were bunchy baby dolls, whose tiered frills were assembled from cutoff shirt collars. Though their neat, to the body aviator shearlings came over as too near Balenciaga to be completely original, for the most part, this collection earned Preen new respect as designers who are gaining real maturity.</p></div>"
89,fall,2004,f2004,proenza-schouler,"No more Mr. Nice Guys: For their Bryant Park debut, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez forsook the sweet all-American girl who had inspired their spring show in favor of a woman straight out of a Helmut Newton portrait: intense, sexy, strong. They dressed her in pants that were seamed, lashed, and tied, and sent her stalking down the runway to a dense, bass-heavy soundtrack in ferocious back-laced boots.</p><p>The opening look featured a wool felt trench with shoulders that Claude Montana could love. It was the first of several coats and jackets that emphasized the shoulders (broad) and waist (small) and were worn layered, in what has already become signature Proenza Schouler style, over intricate bustiers in metallics and muted jewel tones. Feathers, fur, lamé, and sparkle upped the luxury quotient, which reached its apex in a mink sequin coat cinched with a jeweled belt. McCollough and Hernandez played deftly with proportion, especially in jackets like the double-faced cashmere bolero with oversized pockets, and ended with a series of seductive dresses, seamed and fitted to cling to every curve, in which no woman could fail to claim the night.</p></div>"
90,fall,2004,f2004,ralph-lauren,"While it’s great to see new talent finding its wobbly way down the catwalk, sometimes it’s nice to relax in the hands of a professional—especially when he’s at the top of his form. Ralph Lauren’s fall collection, shown on the last day of Fashion Week, was smooth as charmeuse from start to finish: simple, perfectly cut clothes in excellent fabrics, worn by flawless models, to a mellow soundtrack courtesy of Fleetwood Mac.</p><p>Lauren opened with some body-hugging camel-hair pieces—a bateau-neck sweater, a high-waisted slim skirt—that were as cozy as they were sexy. Then he took firm possession of the tweedy trend running through fall, slamming out one great nubby piece after another: a chocolaty mélange, a bold black-and-white check, a frothy black bouclé occasionally dusted with sequins, that he made into trim little blazers, pencil skirts, classic trousers, and pretty ballerina skirts. His outerwear, particularly a generous trench cut from the sparkly black bouclé, was another home run, and Lauren even put a new twist (literally) on the now ubiquitous shrug by making it from a generous loop of cashmere. For drama, he added some blood-red velvet pieces and a lovely, spare black dress with a collarbone-framing scoop neck and graceful swirling skirt. And while the rest of the world is raiding grandma’s jewelry box for her big gold brooches, Lauren’s customer is going her own way, sporting big chunky antique Navajo belts, necklaces, and earrings that keep her suits from getting too fussy.</p><p>For evening, Lauren simply took the great sportswear motif and cut it with a little more va-va-voom. (Who knew a tuxedo jacket could have deep décolletage?) His closing gown, an inky stunner paved from head to toe with winking bugle beads, put a gleaming exclamation point on a very strong statement.</p></div>"
91,fall,2004,f2004,ralph-rucci,"Ralph Rucci will never be a trendsetter. He sets himself apart from all that nonsense to focus on—some might say obsess over—more serious matters like fabric and construction, adopting an intellectual approach that can sometimes get ponderous.</p><p>But the designer has been lightening up of late, and his fall collection proved that brainy and pretty can happily coexist. Using cashmeres, wools, and silks in muted colors—gray, taupe, dark green, violet, and black—Rucci cut slim pants, close-fitted skirts, and easy jersey dresses that are bound to please his discerning clientele. He also showed plenty of his boxy, swingy jackets, the construction of which recalls those other thinker-designers Geoffrey Beene and Cristobal Balenciaga. Rucci even addressed some current trends, via a simple dress covered with stacks of rouged-up mousseline ruffles, a pin-tucked suede skirt, and lots of fur accessories. But he did it all with such acute attention to detail as to transcend any sense of passing whim. (It takes commitment to perfectly tailor a pair of trousers from Russian broadtail or to insert sections of lambskin into the curves of a brown wool-crepe dress without creating a bump or buckle.) And in the case of a waist-length clutch jacket covered with gently wafting guinea hen feathers, the result was a tour de force.</p></div>"
92,fall,2004,f2004,revillon,"Rick Owens knows how to make a deconstructed fur look luxe, and that squares the circle at Revillon…almost. Put it this way: It's easy enough to believe that a woman of good yet conservative taste might comprehend the extravagant chic of, say, his white blanket-wrap mink edged in satin—maybe even see it as an investment, not a trendy buy. Ditto how a cash-rich, low-key coolster might rush to assimilate his dippy, dangly, tuft-sprouting shrugs, scarves, and fierce gauntlets into her wardrobe. Still, even for fans, there's something peculiar in the continuity between the clothes we recognize as Owens' own and those that turn up with a Revillon label.</p><p>Owens has certainly given his all to Revillon. That includes the cropped pants, his up-here, down-there skirts, his shades of greige and mouse, and the strange, almost hairless pallor of the models seen in his own show. Granted, for Revillon, he replaced his beloved denim with needle cord, abused in patches to the point of threadbare, which is certain to be influential. (And he swears those pieces aren't just fillers—they'll definitely be made and sold alongside the fur.)</p><p>In a certain way, all this shows integrity. On top of that, Owens deserves kudos for forging an anti-retro vision for fur. On the downside, why risk cannibalizing his own collection in this way? And grafting an underground aesthetic onto the classic ladylike Parisian fur-store experience is bound to produce certain, er, cultural misunderstandings. What kind of welcome will those scruffy Owens fans receive when they show up at Revillon's very proper front door?</p></div>"
93,fall,2004,f2004,rick-owens,"It's becoming clear that Rick Owens will never deviate from his core look. That drapey, goth-gone-overground thing is just what he does, and no amount of outside pressure is ever going to make him add in, say, a fifties print frock or a pie-frill blouse for the sake of hitting a seasonal trend. Still, the progress of his familiar, heavy-sandaled horde is interesting to watch. The asymmetric, traily things they're wearing for fall—all dipped in a delicate palette of mushroom, mouse, palest lemon, and robin's-egg blue—are actually an undercover version of incredibly wearable luxe.</p><p>Granted, to appreciate this we must first avert our eyes from the saggy-crotched, ribbed men's-underwear leggings: a definite boo-boo from any angle. Instead, for an appreciation of Rick's relevance, refer instead to his jackets. His signature washed-leather and boiled-cashmere compilations have now grown their own version of a peplum, which puts them coolly in line with some other current collections. Others, in curly-haired shearling or fur, are cut with a long scarflike attachment that gets draped and wrapped across the body in a generous cowl. Under these, it's all about layers, as always. The designer's cardigans, some knitted as finely as baby shawls, are flyaway additions to his basic long, skinny T-shirts.</p><p>Owens' pieces are now collectibles that find their way into the wardrobes of many kinds of women the world over. In other words, he's running a real business here. All he needs to do now is cut the repetitions in his presentation, please.</p></div>"
94,fall,2004,f2004,roberto-cavalli,"Roberto Cavalli's runway, wrapped in gilded purple brocade, and his spectacular set—suggesting a Renaissance palazzo with its four-poster bed smothered in spotted fur and flanked by sculpted elephants—could only hint at the fabulous excesses to come. This season, dressing à la Cavalli involves an enticing melting pot of influences, from the lush fabrics favored by the princely merchants of sixteenth-century Venice to the Hapsburg splendors of Sissi, the beautiful nineteenth-century empress of Austria—all leavened with a dash of Johnny Depp-ian piratical swagger.</p><p>And youd need a pirate's ransom to get these clothes on your back; the great Parisian embroidery workrooms had clearly been toiling into the night to embellish Cavalli's collection, which was unbeatable for sheer, decadent luxe. A chinchilla chubby? Smother it with crystal frogging. A Persian lamb hussar's jacket? Lavish it with golden braid. A fabulous shearling, cut like an eighteenth-century man's coat? Encrust it with sparkling jewels. From the Lesage archives came a dazzling sunburst emblem, originally created for Schiaparelli in the 1930s, representing that other giddily opulent Sun King, Louis XIV. The designer gave it new life, lavishing it on furs, using it to anchor artfully draped jersey gowns, and even embroidering it on his teetering cavalier boots.</p><p>For the Cavalli gals fleeting daylight moments, he laid on elaborately seamed second-skin pants, doublets from a Bronzino portrait, and pirate shirts in brocade-print chiffons. Furs ran the gamut from outrageous to even more outrageous—the season's abbreviated bolero shape was pierced with crystal-bordered cutouts, and even a classic pony trench was overprinted with zebra stripes.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""dsjjq""></div></div><p>But after dark, things really let rip. Cavalli was clearly thinking of grand seductions à la <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>—and what more could a great seducer hope for than a romp with a Cavalli diva, barely clad in a wispy chiffon dress, falling off a pale rose satin corset? (Or in anything from the playful finale lineup of short frocks with Madame de Pompadour bodices and a flurry of temptingly rustling skirts.) Yes, Cavalli's heroines just want to have fun—and in this heady collection, the designer served up a treasure trove of exactly that.</p></div>"
95,fall,2004,f2004,rochas,"Olivier Theyskens describes his role at Rochas as acting ""like a hinge between past and present."" That image helped explain the video projection of butterflies, opening and closing their multicolored wings, that played as a backdrop to his fall show—visuals that alluded to the fragile femininity and evanescent color that is emerging, slowly and methodically, from the chrysalis of this long-slumbering Parisian house.</p><p>The renewed look of Rochas has taken shape according to a fifties-couture template. Sculpting his silhouette around the idea of tiny bolero jackets and belled skirts, Theyskens has added his own, next-generation fascination with the structure of old-world underpinnings. Small suits and coats, often cut with curving volume in back, were interspersed with corset-dresses and flounced skirts made of the sheer, stiff crin that once formed the unseen underlayers of haute couture. ""It's really interesting that modern fabrics can evoke these old constructions,"" he said. ""But now we can use techniques like laser cutting, and that can make it better than the original.""</p><p>Theyskens moved the collection forward by sending out his girls in not-so-demure pointy metallic high-heel pumps in candy wrapper-bright turquoise, violet, green, and cherry red. A touch of fluidity and draping turned up in silk camisoles—loose at the breast, tucked into skirts at the back—to create new, bloused, flyaway volumes. As a contrast, his new coat shape, a molded couture duffel, came fastened with ""hinge"" toggles. In all, this collection was a concise, measured development of the brand-building look Theyskens has been working since he joined the house.</p></div>"
96,fall,2004,f2004,saint-laurent,"Tom Ford left the stage with a vividly memorable performance—polished, mature, and perfectly pitched. And that was just the clothes. As for the man, and the way he acquitted himself at a crucial hour, precisely the same description applies. The central player in the most seismic fashion drama of recent memory bowed out smiling, fielding kisses and congratulations with affectionate thanks and a dash of Texan good humor. Tearing an overwrought woman off the shoulder of his red velvet smoking jacket, he said, ""Oh, come on. I'm just takin' a break, that's all!""</p><p>This is a man (an actor by first calling, after all) who knows how to play an emotional scene light. Not that it can't have been nerve-wracking, to say the least, to design the collection that, for better or worse, will go down as his last big statement at Yves Saint Laurent. Which chapter of YSL history to call up for his grand finale? As it turned out, he chose the unexpected: the 1977 Chinese collection that coincided with the launch of Opium. Why? ""Instinct,"" he said. ""I felt the pagoda shoulder was right. And it was a period I hadn't mined.""</p><div><div aria-hidden=""true"" class=""ConsumerMarketingUnitThemedWrapper-iUTMTf jssHut consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content"" role=""presentation""><div class=""consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content""></div><div class=""journey-unit""></div></div></div><p>So, the pagoda shoulder (albeit far more rounded and up-there than Yves's original squared pads) it was—as well as the opportunity for Ford to show what he can do with the concept of chic color clash. The opening look said it all: a crimson silk Mao jacket, a scarlet satin pencil skirt, and a pair of purple velvet wedges with wicked curved-in heels. Then came that shoulder, also with a slither of lingerie satin skirt, a twinning repeated in a series of color contrasts: turquoise with leaf green, poudre pink and grape, and so on.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""547wm""></div></div><p>Ford worked the chinoiserie theme in many keys: subtly, in furs shaved in the pattern of dragon's scales; or full-on, in a tight jet beaded jacket as shiny as a lacquered cabinet. It became both more delicate and sharply sophisticated with the eveningwear. Fragile cheongsams came many ways: fitted sleekly to every curve, in nude silk with an erotic fluff of fur tracing the fastening, in cut-out embroidered lace, or as a full-length cascade of red chiffon flounces.</p><p>The designer also pared away the famous Saint Laurent smokings to become nipped one-button jackets with a deep luxurious wrap of black satin collar. It was the finale dresses that will likely prove the lasting image of Ford's leave-taking, however. Vividly patterned, totally sequined slink-gowns, they slithered along the runway trailing the kind of Hollywood glory for which this man will surely be remembered. Until, of course, his next act…</p></div>"
97,fall,2004,f2004,sebastian-pons,"Sebastian Pons presented his sophomore collection, inspired by Inquisition-era Spain, at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, a former synagogue on New York’s Lower East Side.</p><p>Pons showed some beautiful pieces and confirmed his power as a storyteller with looks like his “communion” suits and a “cardinal” coat. (Though there were times when his narrative got the better of him—who, after all, really wants to look like an altar boy?) The superb craftsmanship that established him as a designer to watch was evident in a print coat with center-front lacing (an update on the stunning Chanel-y suit he showed for spring), some flirty knit skirts, and two very wearable medieval-style dresses featuring chain mail and crystal, courtesy of Swarovski. This was a show that would not have been complete without a fairy-tale ending, which it got via the final look—a strict, chic gown with a subtle train in white and gold brocade. Amen to that.</p></div>"
98,fall,2004,f2004,sonia-rykiel,"A Sonia Rykiel show is, as they say, a French thing. Season after season, year after year, her collections always look the same. That's not to criticize what she does, but simply to say that Rykiel is so deeply involved with her version of <em>Ça C'est Paris!</em> chic—foxy forties frocks, slinky skinny sweaters, fur stoles, and always, always black hose— that she never feels the need to deviate. Trends of the moment might make themselves felt on her runway, but always in the service of Rykiel's true muse: the <em>très jolie</em> mademoiselle of Left Bank café society.</p><p>But—quelle surprise!—this season, Rykiel threw in some looks that wouldn't be out of place at Pastis, like a curvy brown houndstooth tweed coat, a black astrakhan jacket pinned with a diamanté bow brooch, or a floral chiffon tea dress that showed just the tiniest hint of the peach silk slip underneath. As for her recurring accessory of choice—a black beret with a jewel pin—well, some things just don't translate.</p></div>"
99,fall,2004,f2004,sophia-kokosalaki,"It is rare to find a 30-year-old who has a completely thought-out aesthetic that can sustain the flow of a collection without wavering or breaking the spell of its own coherence. Sophia Kokosalaki, the diffidently impressive Greek designer, is such a talent—quietly carving out a coolly elegant way of dressing that springs both from her ethnic roots and her reality as a young, urban, cosmopolitan woman.</p><p>Kokosalaki is great at dresses, to begin with. For fall, she draped and twisted bronze and antique-gold jersey into short, sexy shapes detailed with tiny pleats. The provocation was tempered with opaque tights and tough boots. For evening, her little black dresses, like a jersey smock with a raw tulle-ruffled neckline or a draped strapless tulip dress, were stellar.</p><p>In between, she served up her signature glossily patinated leather jackets, great pants, and tiny, flattering blazers. As an erotic surprise, she slipped a plunging cross-laced bodice beneath a skirt suit. The layered complexity of this collection came not just in the way Kokosalaki put pieces together, but in her personal connection to them. The flat pleating and discreet but quietly rich embroideries that Kokosalaki has claimed for her decorative devices all come from the folk costume of her mother country. But in her hands, it became clothing for Everywoman. Her final outfit, a heavy fur vest emblazoned with medallions of real antique Greek embroidery and worn over a high-waisted dress, had the international press rushing backstage for a closer look.</p></div>"
100,fall,2004,f2004,stella-mccartney,"With Tom Ford (and CEO Domenico De Sole) now out the door at Gucci Group, these must be unsettled times for the other designers whose houses are owned by the company. This might account for the lack of focus that came across in Stella McCartney's collection. Generally pretty tuned in to what her girl wants to wear—and, just as importantly, how she wants to look in it—McCartney was a bit wobbly here. Some of her excursions into volume looked a little troublesome: Anyone for a huge satin and nylon quilted coat that looks like you just swiped the duvet off the bed and went out the door? Thought not.</p><p>But there were moments that worked. McCartney was on much-surer ground when she took her silhouette closer to the body and let the swing of the godets on a slipper-satin skirt or a jersey dress introduce a touch of fluidity and fullness without ever overwhelming the body. She also had some success when her street-savvy tailoring didn¿t stray into the realms of the supersized, such as with a close-fit houndstooth jacket in pale caramel and pink tones, worn with khaki pants tucked into faux-leather seventies-style boots.</p><p>There was the return of the chunky Peruvian sweaters that McCartney must have remembered from her childhood (worn, no doubt, by mom Linda), now looking like a neat update on Fair Isle knits. And there were some good accessories, always a challenge for someone dedicated to never using fur or leather. The standout: a canvas sneaker resting on a high rubber heel.</p></div>"
101,fall,2004,f2004,tim-van-steenbergen,"If Belgian designer Tim Van Steenbergen were a movie director, he would probably be part of the Dogma group, radically challenging the norms of what we expect from the medium. Van Steenbergen cast his fall show, as he did last season, from dance and music schools in Antwerp. ""No professional models!"" he said proudly, just before the show kicked off, and they proceeded to walk the runway while singing their version of ""Mad World,"" the theme from <em>Donnie Darko</em>. At the end of the show, the students lined up looking like some kind of Belgian conceptualist choir. There would probably be a huge demand for them on the alternative cabaret circuit.</p><p>These high jinks shouldn't detract from the seriousness with which van Steenbergen approaches the task in hand. (Sometimes too seriously: While not as wildly conceptual as some, he doesn't always grasp that fashion should flatter. There was an unpleasant moment when a patchwork velvet skirt that could have been worn by about three people hovered into view.) That misstep notwithstanding, Van Steenbergen is down with what a certain cool girl wants to wear. He understands that there is just as much room in her closet for crepe de chine as there is for washed, worn-looking cotton canvas. The faded navy parka with a voluminous back and deep ribbed cuffs was wonderful, ditto the wasp-waist jacket with leg-of-mutton sleeves and the washed silk bias-cut dresses in scarlet or chocolate.</p><p>On the runway, the way these clothes are put together can look like too much. But the trick with a designer like this is to cherry pick; the individual finds can be rather good.</p></div>"
102,fall,2004,f2004,tuleh,"Anyone who has ever run screaming from the word ""ladylike"" might take a look at Tuleh, where Bryan Bradley has successfully unstuffed that formidable term and made a new generation of women yearn for elegance. The label has been a socialite mainstay for years, but it’s only recently that the company has reached for a broader audience—hence the runway shows.</p><p>Bradley’s brief, buoyant fall collection (his second in the tents) showed his deft hand with tricky elements. There were delightfully unexpected color combinations (a yellow wool coat trimmed with gray fox, a coral and green lace dress) and intense, attention-grabbing fabrics, like bold tweeds or elaborate jacquards shot through with metallic and layered with lace. Beautiful tweed jackets had Tuleh’s signature twists: raw edges, extended cuffs, and dressmaker details, plus an occasional camellia-adorned lapel, to make clear their debt to Chanel. For night, he turned the volume down, showing only a few mutely simple black silk dresses and gowns.</p><p>The designer wisely kept silhouettes simple and tailored, occasionally adding a knee-grazing scarf or some giant clear buttons for a bit of whimsy. And that’s the secret to Tuleh’s success: a sense of fun that came through loud and clear in the tissue-thin cashmere T-shirts, printed with a Tuleh logo that looked like it could have come off a bottle of barbecue sauce and a range of mottos, including “we is (sic) family.” Those T-shirts, layered over silky dresses and blouses, are destined for socialite closets worldwide—along with the rest of this collection.</p></div>"
103,fall,2004,f2004,undercover,"It¿s always somewhat dispiriting to hear the hectoring tones of Patti Smith as a show gets underway; it normally means that, fashion-wise, doom and gloom are on the agenda. Thankfully, this wasn't the case at Undercover. It was Ms. Smith's androgynous, 1970s New Wave style—her layers of dinner jackets, striped vests, and slouchy shirts, worn with stretch leggings or faded denims—by which designer Jun Takahashi was inspired.</p><p>Yet, unlike the many Japanese teenagers in Tokyo and beyond who copy the styles of rock icons with staggering accuracy, Takahashi wasn't interested in merely paying sartorial homage to the woman who gave us <em>Horses</em>. He has a sly, witty way with fashion and he used Smith's style as the starting point for an exploration of how clothes change with wear over the years. As the show progressed, Takahashi's designs appeared to soften and age: The jackets, some lightly quilted, became a little more oversized and slope-shouldered, while the T-shirts stretched to become tunics. Even the felt fedora hats seemed to get floppier by the minute.</p><p>Takahashi also explored the way in which clothes get made more personal as time goes by: tying a clutch of scarves onto the waistband of a pair of pants; decorating a shawl by pinning it with stuffed felt charms in the shape of medals and keys (these trinkets were inspired by the work of artist Anne-Valerie Dupond); giving a jacket random buttons—as if his wannabe Pattis had simply been too busy mosh-pitting to even consider replacing the fastenings they'd lost with ones that matched.</p></div>"
104,fall,2004,f2004,united-bamboo,"Miho Aoki and Thuy Pham have been part of New York's indie art-fashion scene for half a decade now, but this season marked the United Bamboo duo's runway debut. Held on Park Avenue at the Scandinavia House, a venue chosen for its clean modernity, the show drew Proenza Schouler's Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough in the front row, and featured a live soundtrack of breathy vocals and acoustic guitar by Together, the brand-new musical collaboration between Rusty Santos and Noah.</p><p>United Bamboo like to play on all-American, usually preppy, staples, and their fall show was billed as ""downtown chic going to an uptown party."" The uptown quotient predominated in a succession of proper ensembles—tweedy and pleated skirts, pin-tuck trousers, bow-tied dresses. While a certain amount of irony was implicit, it was a relief when fur- and scarf-trimmed box jackets were removed to reveal more adventurous, even punky, layered and pieced tops. There were also some interesting tailoring details, such as a removable tail on a tuxedo suit. The ""disheveled glamour"" Aoki and Pham aimed to evoke was most successfuly achieved in a striking outsized navy stripe trenchcoat, pea and duffle coats with expandable pockets, and a pleated skirt gathered by a wool harness at the waist.</p></div>"
105,fall,2004,f2004,valentino,"With so much softness, lightness, and unabashed luxury everywhere this season, it would seem obvious for Valentino to take his collection in that direction, too. After all, what could be more perfect for <em>le jet set</em>? But the designer doesn't seem to feel that way. Instead, this fall, Val's gals are as intent on creating a charged erotic frisson as they are in looking elegant. Think of the work of the late photographer Helmut Newton and you'll get the general idea: predatory women who like to flaunt whatever God did (sexy curves) or didn¿t (serious rocks) give them.</p><p>Valentino played up that feeling with references to the divine decadence of Marlene Dietrich in her <em>Blue Angel</em> era. That inspiration was best expressed by the black chiffon evening dresses that closed the show: slim columns, their simplicity complemented by a draped bodice or a back or front sliced to reveal an embroidered or satin bra.</p><p>While the designer showed mostly black for evening (and put on the runway only one of his trademark red dresses, a taffeta number appliquéd with flowers) there were welcome flashes of color in his daywear: a reed-thin mauve silk charmeuse dress, a pale pink organza shirt worn with a floor-length ruffled skirt. To ward off a night chill, there were fur boleros that looked like a more substantial version of the evening shrug that has been a recurrent idea on this season's runways. Valentino might have been inspired by a platinum blonde from days gone by, but it's intriguing to think what a more contemporary version—someone like Gwen Stefani, say—might do with one of those dazzling evening dresses right now.</p></div>"
106,fall,2004,f2004,vera-wang,"It’s getting increasingly difficult to categorize Vera Wang as a designer. Her clothes are thoughtful, but romantic too; artistic, but eminently wearable; and sexy, without being overtly so. Of course, you could just call them beautiful and leave it at that.</p><p>Although she’s still best known for her evening and wedding gowns, Wang’s daywear is coming on strong. For fall, she worked in a muted palette, mixing dusty, tea-dipped colors like taupe and pink with intense greens and purples as well as black and brown. She cut slim skirts and trousers with neat, narrow waistbands that sat low—but not too low—on the hips and showed them with soft blouses, bare-armed chiffon tops, and tissue-thin cashmere sweaters. There were strict, sharp wool coats over satin dresses, gleaming furs, and wispy, pin-tucked dresses, often paired with chunky fur shrugs. Wang even dabbled in abstract prints, like a muted wine-toned splattered silk that showed up in a lean little dress with an inset waistband of raw-edged tweed.</p><p>The designer showed a similar restraint in her evening looks. She shaped her chiffon confections with bias cuts or hand-sewn details and touched them with just the right amount of beading or ruffles—as well as plenty of pieces from her own line of diamond jewelry. And why not? Having put together a collection this strong, Wang has earned the right to gild her own lily.</p></div>"
107,fall,2004,f2004,veronique-branquinho,"With a simple dimming of the lights and the switching on of a projector, Veronique Branquinho transformed a downbeat Paris dance hall into a midnight woodland—stark trees silhouetted on the walls, will-o'-the-wisp mist rolling ankle-deep across the floor. Into that magical setting, she sent a new take on her reserved but strangely forceful vision of young, self-respecting womanhood. From the moment her first long-silhouetted girl began stepping her way through the mist in a wax-coated jacket, ankle-length jersey skirt, and high glossy boots, it was clear the audience was in for an experience out of the ordinary. ""I wanted it to be strong but elegant—and intimate,"" she said.</p><p>With covered-up primness a growing trend this season, Branquinho is firmly on the territory she began staking out with her first Victorian-influenced collection in 1997. Yet as high-necked and unrevealing as her clothes may be—from the turtleneck tweed blousons to the silk print long-sleeve shirt-dresses—there is nothing in the least bit dowdy about them. Instead, her look has the quiet sexual power of the girl who knows she needn't flicker so much as an eyelash to turn heads.</p><p>The hallmarks of Branquinho's clothes are part seventies Ali MacGraw, part Brontë heroine, and entirely Antwerp individualist: lanky lines, a slightly puff-sleeved shoulder line, wrap dresses, and accessories like long knitted scarves. For winter, she's also added sparkle to the look, in brown or cobalt sequinned skirts and vests. Balanced beautifully between romanticism and realism, this was a collection that sent the audience out chattering with admiration.</p></div>"
108,fall,2004,f2004,versace,"Donatella Versace can relate to the cross-generational appeal of punk. Her brother Gianni frequently referenced it (remember that famous safety-pin dress), and for fall, she revisited the 30-year-old style as a kind of house classic. Strangely enough, it worked as a perfect medium for dressing the chic modern mom. As proved by the soundtrack—Chrissie Hynde at her gritty best—age cannot dim the spirit of the hardcore rock chick, and this show translated that attitude into some great daywear.</p><p>Donatella is not the first to try shredding the edges of tartan, but her plaid suits, in combinations of red and white, purple and black, or yellow and white, had a fierceness of cut that was pure Versace. And with their back-combed chignons and dark glasses, her women can throw a cashmere cardigan over a houndstooth sheath (complete with sparkling brooch) and make it look a million miles from frumpy. That in itself was a cheering sight in a season that poses many potential styling problems for the grown-up woman: classy, but just sexy enough to show you ain't retired yet.</p><p>By comparison, Versace's eveningwear was more predictable, with the photo-op possibilities ranging from several slashed black dresses to the anatomically sliced red finale. Though these will be much in evidence on the red carpet in coming weeks, it's the strong daywear that's likely to pull in new customers for the house.</p></div>"
109,fall,2004,f2004,versus-versace,"Here's the news about Versus this season: It's not so much a collection that young, rebellious women will go out to buy for themselves, as it is a safe destination for mother-and-teen-daughter shopping. Donatella Versace (who of course has her own teenage daughter, Allegra, to bounce ideas off) was recently taken by a story in the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> that discussed how the punk ethos has been sanitized over the years. The article (reprinted from <em>The New York Times</em>) pointed out that now even private-school kids are weekend punks, tolerated and often encouraged by their world-wise parents.</p><p>That explains Donatella's program note, describing the punk-inspired Versus show as, ""A subversive mixture of education and rebellion."" She addressed the eternal parental fashion-control issue by allowing her junior collection to go out the door looking like a shorter, tartier, big-haired version of the grown-up Versace line. That meant a lot of tartan mini-kilts, orange biker suits, and tiger-patterned denims, and a loading of metal hardware in the form of heavy Medusa-head cuffs and chain belts. For extra measure, she also threw in a few skimpy asymmetric jersey dresses, just to prevent those daughterly raids on Versace Mom's eveningwear closet. So, now the moral becomes clear: A girl who gets good grades might just be rewarded with a little trip to Versus. After all, as we know from the dear old Osbournes, the family that rocks together stays together.</p></div>"
110,fall,2004,f2004,viktor-rolf,"Viktor &amp; Rolf's audience is still trying to adjust to the Dutch duo's surprising segue into commercial clothes. After the recent 10-year retrospective of their ultra avant-garde work, the pair moved on to a new phase: producing their version of real-life fashion. Their fall show featured headgear that was still up there in the conceptual ether—antlers for some, Bambi sprouts for others—and a soundtrack that added the threat of hunters' gunfire. But underneath, all the clothes were reworkings of regular garments. As Rolf Snoeren explained, ""We wanted to create a sort of fashion fairy tale. We've always loved classics and we think they are something special, which should be protected.""</p><p>The walk in the woods began with a sensible loden, high-collared belted coat. It was followed by an outfit that, in its way, commented on all the ladylike silhouette-crafting that's going on in the fashion mainstream: a bolero jacket over a ribbed gray turtleneck and a wrap skirt fastened with a sparkling jewel. A camel car coat with a double collar was a reminder of the exaggerated multi-lapels the designers have piled on in former times; the device reappeared later, much watered-down, in double-fronted shirts. For all their reputation as out-there performance artists, Viktor Horsting and Snoeren are now displaying a canny knack for trend. Wide-leg pants, newly emerged this season, were in their collection, nicely done in fluid tuxedo suits. Ditto, brooches—great, big rose sprigs or slightly sinister oversized spiders were pinned to the breasts of coats or at the throat on scarves.</p><p>Perhaps all this connectedness is down to the guys' decision to get out of the house more. Like the thorough students they are, they recently embarked on a fact-finding mission to the Golden Globes to research Hollywood celebrity. The results could be seen at the end of their show, in a series of glamour gowns. Swarovksi glitter sheaths came out swathed in chiffon, emerald charmeuse goddess gowns were studded with golden jewels, and plunging black lace floated over nude linings.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""tgg0gj""></div></div><p>Something, however, is slightly wrong with this picture—and one can never help suspecting (hoping, even) that the effect is a conscious stroke of irony. Because the last thing anyone needs to see is a pair of extraordinary talents like Horsting and Snoeren—designers who have blown our minds in the past—subsiding into something indistinguishable from normality.</p></div>"
111,fall,2004,f2004,ys-yohji-yamamoto,"Heavy cotton drill parkas? Check. Huge cargo pants? Check. More than a little noir? Check. Season after season, there are certain elements that Yohji Yamamoto includes in his Y's collection. The only things missing this time around were the enormous chunky knits that have been so appealing to him in the past. (Though he did manage to slip a few into the proceedings—layered, if you can imagine, over short military surplus-style anoraks.) The designer also gave a nod to both his past and his present: the former via some Edwardian-era tailcoats with a complicated arrangement of buttons and the latter with the very Y-3-like, sporty biker jackets in a mix of neoprene and leather. Just in case those assembled didn't quite register the provenance of the zippered jackets, he dropped a heavy hint by emblazoning their backs with the logo ""YamaMOTO."" The designer's usual subtlety had obviously roared off somewhere on a 50-cc engine.</p><p>That's not to say that everything was familiar: Yamamoto gave a contemporary spin to some khaki cotton suits by pairing them with rockabilly-style crepe-soled shoes. And, in a season where the chiffon blouse has been reinterpreted over and over again, there was something alluring about his cool, crisp cotton shirts—reworked to perfection with panels of fabric that looked like deconstructed bows affixed to the collar or the cuffs.</p></div>"
112,fall,2004,f2004,yohji-yamamoto,"The first fall offerings from Yohji Yamamoto were six soft, multicolored, printed tailcoats, laid out on the floor of a freezing school hall. Perhaps the result of a journey to Tibet, Uzbekistan, or somesuch folkloric pilgrimage? ""No,"" he said laconically. ¿I just wanted to prove I can do color.¿ The patterns¿flowery, mini-paisley mixes, ink jet-printed on double-faced flannel¿suggested, he said cheerfully, ¿a cheap hotel.¿</p><p>Then in filed a Yamamoto army of quiffed rockabillies, picking up the coats and shrugging them over layers of printed tunics and slouchy cuffed trousers in a nice m¿l¿e of dusty blues, violet, ocher, and cinnamon. Having made the color point, Yamamoto reverted to his beloved all-black avant-garde cutting, this season scissored into an Edwardiana-meets-rocker kind of elegance.</p><p>Variations on high-collared cutaway coats, shown with cropped pants and biker boots, have a lanky swagger. While some are hung with chrome chains and others come with snowflake-knit sleeves, the most sophisticated tailoring is paired with bunchy velvet bows, spilling artfully from the front. Another experiment (a subtle dig at the alarming proliferation of must-have bags, maybe?) places big leather pockets at the front of skewed pea coats, receptacles roomy enough to allow a woman to roam the world hands-free.</p><div class=""AdWrapper-dQtivb fZrssQ ad ad--in-content""><div class=""ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"" data-node-id=""cuwyd""></div></div><p>The best came last: a striking sequence of sweeping greatcoats and capes with layers of collars and oversize brass and chrome buttons. Part military, part highwayman, the variations include a tiny-waisted version, its huge collar trimmed in white sailor braid, and a trench whose detail is picked out in red patent leather. The effect¿gutsy and chic at the same time¿reveals Yamamoto leading fashion¿s forward march once more.</p></div>"
113,fall,2004,f2004,zac-posen,"To provide a backdrop for his fall collection, titled <em>Blixen</em> (as in reindeer), Zac Posen carpeted the floor of a Bryant Park tent with black Astroturf and installed a grove of silvery tree sculptures. Of course, Posen’s audience is its own decor (this season it included Claire Danes and the artist Chuck Close), but the designer is a born showman and he loves to set a stage.</p><p>He’s also, five seasons into his career, developing real range, not to mention an inventive sense of color and solid craftsmanship. His signatures—the neckline that arches chinward and then plunges deep into the décolleté, the hourglass fit, the mitered stripes—were all present and accounted for. But there were new developments, too: Posen worked in a lot of jersey and knits, which softened his edges and produced some lovely looks, like a pink cashmere dress or a charming black knit T-shirt, trimmed in blue ribbon and worn with a simple black pencil skirt. Even the pieced geometric dresses in contrasting hues fell on the wearable side of artsy.</p><p>The designer’s evening showstoppers included a figure-hugging polychrome lace sheath, a fluttery pin-tucked organza dress, and a dreamy blue organza ball gown. It may have all been based on fantasy, but Posen produced a real-life wardrobe that goes from morning coffee straight through to the last nightcap.</p></div>"
