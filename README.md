## Abstract
Abstract: This section provides a brief summary of the project, highlighting the main research question, methodology, results, and conclusions. It should be concise and clear, usually limited to 250-300 words.


## Introduction
One of my favorite movie monologues of all time is by Meryl Streep (as fictional fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly) in the 2006 cult classic The Devil Wears Prada. After a poorly timed joke by her extremely ill-equipped assistant, Streep famously exposes the trend cycle as we know it today while simultaneously decimating Anne Hathaway and shining a light on the true power of the fashion industry leaders in the process.

> “You… go to your closet, and you select… I don’t know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back, but what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually cerulean. You’re also blithely unaware of the fact that, in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns, and then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent, wasn’t it?… who showed cerulean military jackets. … And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. Then it filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic casual corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars of countless jobs, and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room… from a pile of ‘stuff.’”

Even as I read the words for the hundredth time, I can feel the prickling sensation I got the first time I ever watched the film. In a world in which the illusion of choice is everywhere, fashion is often advertised as an escape - an opportunity for one to make choices based exclusively on their own intended self-expression. However, just like most things in our society, the vast majority of decisions we make have already been made for us by a group of highly influential elites. 

I have always been interested in fashion trend forecasting and occasionally attempt to qualitatively analyze things myself, but this project is by far my most ambitious endeavor yet. As I began to research current methodologies in trend forecasting agencies, I discovered that most projects are aimed at evaluating the lifetimes of trends rather than evaluating the characteristics that enable the most successful members of the fashion industry to maintain their success and influence. This makes sense in the context of our efficiency and profit-driven world, but my instincts tell me that trend forecasting as a field would benefit from the greater contextualization of analyzing brand longevity. 

I hope that by discovering similarities between different designer collections and overall seasons I will be able to identify and anticipate potential upcoming trends and that by analyzing designer prevalence over time I will be able to predict the future success of specific designers.
